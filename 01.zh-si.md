# Adora Cheung & Geoff Ralston - Introduction to Startup School

Geoff Ralston: Good morning to you guys who are here live, but good day to everyone who is viewing this class online. Welcome to Y Combinator's second annual massively open online course Startup School.

杰夫·拉斯顿：早上好，大家都是现场直播的，但对所有在线观看这门课的人来说，祝你们一天愉快。欢迎来到YCombinator第二届年度大型在线课程启动学校。

I'm Geoff Ralston.

我是杰夫·拉斯顿。

I'm a partner here at Y Combinator and one of the organizers of this year's Startup School.

我是YCombinator的合伙人，也是今年创业学校的组织者之一。

Starting today we're hoping that YC's knowledge about entrepreneurship will help spur incredible innovation from all of you here and out there to create enormous value for the societies in which you live, for your friends, your families, your employees, and for yourselves. We're going to cover just a few things before we actually get started on the course, so I hope you'll bear with us. First, more companies than ever before asked to take part in Startup School this year. 27,000 companies from around the world asked to be part of it.

从今天开始，我们希望YC的创业知识将有助于激发你们所有人的不可思议的创新，为你们所生活的社会、为你们的朋友、家人、雇员和你们自己创造巨大的价值。在我们真正开始这个课程之前，我们只会讨论几件事，所以我希望你能容忍我们。首先，今年申请参加创业学校的公司比以往任何时候都多。来自世界各地的27，000家公司要求参与其中。

That's a number that kind of blows me away every time I think about it. 15,000 of those companies asked to actually participate in the class, and that's from over 100 countries and over 8000 cities around the world, really extraordinary numbers. Now, some of you may have heard that we had in fact intended to actually only allow about a quarter of those 15,000 to take the class, just because there are actual infrastructure limitations. Well I don't know if you did hear or didn't hear, but there was a slight glitch in our process.

每次我想到这个数字都会让我大吃一惊。这些公司中有15，000家要求参加这门课程，来自世界各地100多个国家和8000多个城市，数量非常惊人。现在，你们中的一些人可能听说过，事实上，我们实际上只打算允许这15，000人中的大约1/4上这门课，仅仅因为有实际的基础设施限制。我不知道你是听到了还是没听到，但我们的过程中有一点小故障。

In the end, we accepted all 15,000 companies, give or take. We accepted everyone, it's 15,000 give or take.

最后，我们接受了所有15，000家公司，无论是给予还是接受。我们接受了每一个人，这是15，000的给予或接受。

This means that this will be, by far, the largest class or startups that Y Combinator, or for that matter, anyone else has ever taught, so congratulations on being part of the biggest class.

这意味着，到目前为止，这将是YCombinator最大的一个或几个创业公司，或者说，其他任何人都教过，所以恭喜你成为了最大的班级的一员。

I don't know if that's great or not, but congratulations you're still part of it. Let me just do a brief interlude about Startup School. Y Combinator began in 2005 by funding more companies simultaneously than had ever been done before, even though we only started with eight companies in our first batch.

我不知道这是否很好，但恭喜你仍然是其中的一员。让我做一个简短的插曲关于创业学校。YCombinator在2005年开始为更多的公司同时提供资金，这比以往任何时候都要多，尽管我们在第一批中只有8家公司。

Today we fund over 300 companies every year and work with them in an intense 3 month program, but there are many, many more 1000s who actually apply for those spots. We always knew that there was a possibility of our knowledge having greater reach, so that's why we started Startup School to maximize how many companies we could reach with our knowledge, to get it to as many companies around the world, to maximize, and this is our stated goal as a company, the innovation in the world. We think that is almost always a really good thing. We would like to find a way for every startup to succeed, and yes, there is self-interest here because it would be awesome if one or more of you out there today was the next huge Y Combinator company, and why not, right? We first experimented with the idea of greater reach in 2014 with a course taught by Y Combinator's president Sam Altman called How To Start A Startup.

今天，我们每年为300多家公司提供资金，并在一个为期3个月的紧张项目中与他们合作，但实际上有更多的1000人实际上申请了这些职位。我们一直都知道，我们的知识有可能有更大的影响力，这就是为什么我们开办创业学校，最大限度地利用我们的知识，让我们能够接触到多少家公司，让我们拥有尽可能多的公司，实现最大化，这是我们作为一家公司的既定目标，即世界上的创新。我们认为这几乎总是一件好事。我们希望为每一家初创公司找到一种成功的途径，是的，这里有自己的利益，因为如果今天在座的一位或多位是下一家大型的Y组合公司，那就太棒了，为什么不呢？2014年，我们首次尝试了扩大影响力的想法，由Y Combinator总裁山姆·奥特曼(SamAltman)教授了一门课程，名为“如何启动创业”(How To Start A Startup)。

It was a conventional course taught at Stanford with the difference that there was an online component.

这是斯坦福大学教授的一门传统课程，其不同之处在于它有一个在线组件。

The lectors were videoed and then placed online. Last year, we rethought that course as a massively open online course with the difference that the classes would be coupled with online access, a community, software tools, and of course, most importantly, weekly meetings with groups and check-ins.

这些讲演者被录像，然后放到网上。去年，我们重新考虑了这个课程，认为它是一个大规模开放的在线课程，不同的是，课程将与在线访问、社区、软件工具相结合，当然，最重要的是，每周与小组和签入会议一起进行。

This year, we're going to reprise that idea with some notable differences. We're still going to have a combination of in-person and online classes, but we have revamped software.

今年，我们将重申这一观点，并有一些显著的不同之处。我们仍然会有一个面对面和在线课程的组合，但我们已经改造了软件。

This year, most of the curricula will be taught by YC partners and YC alumni.

今年，大部分课程将由YC合作伙伴和YC校友讲授。

There's, as I mentioned, new software for community and for management.

正如我提到的，有新的社区软件和管理软件。

There's scale, we're scaling larger than we ever have before.

有规模，我们的规模比以往任何时候都大。

The timing of this class is different. Last year it was taught in the spring.

这个班的上课时间不一样。去年春天教的。

This year is timed to coincide with the YC batch so that hopefully as many of y'all as possible who want to apply to the YC Winter 2019 batch can conveniently do so.

今年的时间安排在YC批次的同时，希望你们中有尽可能多的人能够方便地申请YC冬季2019年批次。

There's also a $10,000 grant, non-equity grant, available for 100 companies who complete and graduate from the course and in a few minutes my partner, Adora, will go through the criteria for graduation. Also, for the first time we've collected really an extraordinary library of startup content at the URL you see there.

还有一笔10，000美元的非股权补助，可以给100家完成课程并毕业的公司，几分钟后，我的合伙人Adora将通过毕业的标准。另外，我们第一次在您看到的URL上收集了一个非常出色的启动内容库。

I really encourage you guys to go look at it. You can find that, there's a link to it online when you log in to the site.

我真的鼓励你们去看看。你可以发现，当你登录到这个网站时，有一个在线链接。

It's an open library available to anyone. Also, we have some incredible deals for the 15,000 companies that you can also see when you log in online.

这是一个任何人都可以使用的开放图书馆。此外，我们为15，000家公司提供了一些令人难以置信的交易，当你在网上登录时，你也可以看到这些交易。

I really want to call out, the folks offering deals were not expecting to offer those deals to 15,000 companies, it was a big surprise, and a number of them really, really, really stepped up. Amazon Web Services is offering $1000 credit to every single, $1000 of AWS credits to everybody.

我真的很想说，那些提供交易的人并没有期望向15，000家公司提供这些交易，这是一个很大的惊喜，他们中的一些人真的加快了步伐。亚马逊网络服务公司(AmazonWebServices)为每个人提供1000美元的信贷，为每个人提供1000美元的AWS信用。

Thank you Amazon.

谢谢亚马逊。

Thank you Google for offering $1000 in Google Cloud and Fire based credits.

感谢谷歌提供1000美元的GoogleCloud和Fire基础学分。

Two YC companies, Stripe and Clerky, have also really stepped up.

YC的两家公司-Stripe和办事员-也确实加快了步伐。

Stripe is offering an incredible deal on Stripe Atlas, 50% off for all of the companies and $5000 of fee free payment processing. Clerky is also giving a fantastic deal, $599 gets you formation, a bank account, and lots more from Clerky. Briefly I'm going to take you through the curriculum here. Our first week kicks off with an introduction to get Startup School and your company off the ground.

Stripe在Stripe Atlas上提供了一个令人难以置信的交易，所有公司50%的折扣和5000美元的免费支付处理。办事员也给了你一个很棒的交易，599美元可以让你结业，一个银行账户，还有很多更多的东西来自办事员。简单地说，我将在这里向你们介绍课程。我们的第一周开始一个介绍，让创业学校和你的公司离开地面。

Then for the next three weeks we dig in deeply into building something that people want and then figuring out how to get users for that something.

然后在接下来的三周里，我们深入研究如何构建人们想要的东西，然后找出如何让用户使用这些东西。

Then, we spend a bunch of time talking about how to effectively run a startup with an interlude by YC partner Dalton Caldwell in week six, which I think you'll find very helpful in terms of thinking through how to apply to YC, how to succeed at an interview with YC, and at YC itself.

然后，我们花了很多时间讨论如何在YC合伙人道尔顿·考德威尔第六周的插曲中有效地管理一家初创公司，我认为这在思考如何申请YC、如何在YC的面试中取得成功以及YC本身的问题上都是非常有帮助的。

Then, we finish up with some lectures on fundraising and with an eye towards the future. Another new aspect to Startup School this year is something I'm really excite about, which is something we're calling conversations.

然后，我们结束了一些关于筹款的讲座，并展望了未来。今年创业学校的另一个新方面是我非常兴奋的事情，我们称之为对话。

There's going to be two kinds of conversations, real ones, live, in person, with a notable expert in some useful domain as well as AMAs, Ask Me Anythings, on our forums where the experts will respond to questions, both asked in advance and live. Actually, this week we have an AMA tomorrow and a conversation on Friday that you'll learn more about.

我们会有两种对话，一种是真实的对话，一种是面对面的，和一些有用领域的知名专家，还有AMAs，问我任何事情，在我们的论坛上，专家们会回答问题，都是预先问的，也是现场的。事实上，这周我们有一个AMA明天和星期五的谈话，您将了解更多。

If it's not obvious, we're doing a lot more this year, a lot of new things.

如果不是很明显的话，我们今年会做更多的事情，很多新的事情。

Some of those things aren't planned, weren't planned, so we ask you to bear with us.

有些事情是没有计划的，不是有计划的，所以我们要求你容忍我们。

This is our small team, we're very effective, very tight, but small, but we'll fix everything that goes wrong as quickly as possible and will respond to you as quickly as possible. Understand that there's a big scale here and there are many companies that are taking Startup School and we are going to do our best to make all of your experiences as successful as possible. Now, Adora, the YC partner with whom I'm organizing Startup School is going to go over some of the details as to how the 2018 class is actually going to work. No need to applaud. [inaudible] .

这是我们的小团队，我们非常有效，非常紧密，但规模很小，但是我们会尽快解决所有出错的问题，并尽快对你做出反应。要明白，这里有一个很大的规模，有许多公司正在收购创业学校，我们将尽我们最大的努力，使您的所有经验尽可能成功。现在，Adora，我正在组织StartupSchool的YC合作伙伴，将详细介绍2018年课程的实际运作情况。不用鼓掌。[听不见]


Adora Cheung: All right, so I am going to talk about the structure of the course.

张朵拉：好的，我要谈谈课程的结构。

There are five main components to this course, which you see up here, weekly class lectures, weekly group office hours, company updates, forum, and presentation day.

这门课程有五个主要组成部分，你可以在这里看到，每周上课、每周小组办公时间、公司更新、论坛和演示日。

I'm going to go over all of these and at the end I will demo how it actually works in the software.

我将讨论所有这些，最后我将演示它在软件中的实际工作方式。

Start off, as you already know, each Tuesday we'll be recording around two hours of lectures on a variety of topics related to building and growing your startup, which Geoff already did a good preview of. Before most lectures we will be sending out what we call a prep material, which is like videos and slides to review so that the speakers can get to the good stuff ASAP instead of spending too much time on the mundane basics. Please take the time to review those notes if you can.

首先，正如你已经知道的，每周二我们将录制大约两个小时的讲座，内容涉及到创建和成长你的创业公司，杰夫已经对此做了一个很好的预览。在大多数讲座之前，我们将发送我们所说的准备材料，这就像视频和幻灯片一样，让演讲者能够尽快找到好的东西，而不是花太多时间在日常的基本知识上。如果可以的话，请花时间复习这些笔记。

If you're in the San Francisco Bay area you will be able to attend these lectures in person. Unfortunately, there's only a limited amount of seats, so we can't fit everyone each time, but we will confirm via RSVPs if you can attend a lecture, so please only come if you get an invite to that particular lecture. We will start at 10 AM each Tuesday, please be in your seat by then.

如果你在旧金山湾区，你可以亲自参加这些讲座。不幸的是，只有有限的座位，所以我们不能满足每个人的每次，但我们将通过RSVPs确认，如果你可以参加一个讲座，所以请来，只有当你收到邀请参加那个特定的讲座。我们每个星期二上午10点开始，请在那之前到你的座位上。

The speaker will give the lecture and then Q&A will be done afterwards. However, most of you will actually be watching the lectures online. We will posting the lectures every Wednesday after the Tuesday lecture, around 12 PM, or at least by 12 PM each week. We encourage you to just watch whenever you get a chance. Weekly group office hours, as you may or may not know, we've already placed you in groups of 15-30 companies each, mostly based on location.

演讲者将进行演讲，然后问答将在之后进行。然而，你们中的大多数人实际上都会在网上观看讲座。我们每周三都会在星期二的讲座之后张贴这些讲座，大约在中午12点左右，或者至少在每周12点之前。我们鼓励你只要有机会就看。每周的小组办公时间，你可能知道，也可能不知道，我们已经把你分成15至30家公司组成的小组，主要是根据地点而定。

This is to provide a more intimate experience. Consider this group your immediate support network for Startup School and hopefully beyond Startup School.

这是为了提供一种更亲密的体验。考虑这一组，你的直接支持网络启动学校，并希望超越启动学校。

These are your go-to people when you need help or you want to discuss something related to your startup. One of the ways we make sure you leverage this group effectively is through weekly group office hours. We think this is actually the most important thing to participate in, even more so then potentially the lectures. You can think of weekly group office hours as two things, one, it's a weekly check-in to keep everyone accountable.

当你需要帮助或者你想讨论一些与你的创业有关的事情时，这些都是你去找的人。我们确保你有效利用这个群体的方法之一就是每周的小组办公时间。我们认为这实际上是最重要的参与，甚至比潜在的讲座更重要。你可以把每周的小组办公时间看作两件事，一是每周报到，让每个人都负责。

Two, it's like a group therapy session where you can air out your week, ask for help, and get feedback from your peers.

第二，这就像一个小组治疗会议，在那里你可以广播你的一周，寻求帮助，并从你的同龄人那里得到反馈。

The way that group office hours work is pretty straight forward. Each session is led by a moderator.

小组办公时间的工作方式相当直截了当。每一次会议由一名主持人主持。

The moderator calls the meeting to order and then he or she facilitates a discussion in which one founder from each company says three things, one, their company one liner to remind everyone what they're actually working on, which actually is quite a tough thing to say what you're working on in one line. You should help each other work on that.

主持人召集会议，然后他或她促成了一次讨论，每家公司的一位创始人说了三件事，一位是他们的公司，一位是班轮，提醒每个人他们实际在做什么，这实际上是一件很难说出你在做什么的事情。你们应该在这方面互相帮助。

Two, is goals for your last week and why you did or did not meet that goal.

第二，是你最后一周的目标，也是你实现或没有达到这个目标的原因。

Three, your biggest problem or obstacle that the group can help you with.

第三，你的最大问题或障碍，小组可以帮助你。

Then this is followed by discussion in which each company spends about 5-10 minutes, depending on the number of people who actually show up to group office hours that week, and the moderator goes last. Like I said, each group only has one moderator.

然后是讨论，每家公司大约花费5-10分钟，具体取决于每周出席小组办公时间的人数，主持人排在最后。就像我说的，每个小组只有一个主持人。

Some groups have been already assigned a moderator.

一些小组已经被指派了一名主持人。

These are volunteers from the YC founder community. Many groups do not have one yet.

这些是YC创始人社区的志愿者。许多团体还没有。

These groups will need to select one amongst themselves.

这些团体将需要在他们之间选择一个。

So, if you are in a group without a moderator currently, and you will know this via the software, which I'll show you shortly, your homework is to do this ASAP by Thursday. How to select a moderator for your group, first, ask yourself if you are that person, do you want to do this? This involves extra time, energy, and thought. Just be cognizant of the extra work before volunteering. You will need to set the weekly schedule for your group, encourage and drive discussions, and constantly ask the group for input and guide the conversations.

所以，如果你现在是一个没有主持人的小组，你会通过软件知道这一点，我很快就会向你展示，你的家庭作业将在周四前尽快完成。如何为你的小组挑选一个主持人，首先，问问自己，如果你是那个人，你想这样做吗？这需要额外的时间、精力和思想。在做义工之前要注意到额外的工作。你需要为你的小组设定每周的时间表，鼓励和推动讨论，并不断地向小组征求意见和指导对话。

Should you choose to accept this mission we will be running a moderator training session this Friday.

如果您选择接受这一任务，我们将在本周五举办主持人培训课程。

It's going to be livestream at 9 AM Pacific. We'll be posting the recording of it afterwards if you can't attend. You should immediately get together with the group via the two channels we provide, which is video chat and group forum, or some other way that's best for you and figure this out. One easy way to figure this out is whoever volunteers first gets the role so there's no arguing there. Please submit your choice by Friday so that the right person knows to attend the training session. Here is the link to submit. We will send this out to you afterward so you don't really need to write this down now.

它将在上午9点在太平洋进行直播。如果你不能出席的话，我们以后会把它的录音发出去。您应该立即通过我们提供的两个渠道，即视频聊天和小组论坛，或其他对您最好的方式，并解决这个问题。解决这个问题的一个简单方法是，志愿者首先得到这个角色，所以这里没有争论。请在星期五之前提交您的选择，以便合适的人知道参加培训课程。这是提交的链接。我们以后会把这个发给你，这样你现在就不需要把这个写下来了。

The obvious question might be what if no one in your group volunteers to be a moderator? Well, the answer is if no one volunteers then no one in the group can participate in Startup School. Your entire group will be auditing the class instead.

最明显的问题可能是，如果你的团队中没有人自愿成为主持人呢？好吧，答案是如果没有人自愿的话，那么这个团体中就没有人可以参加创业学校了。您的整个组将对类进行审计。

This seems harsh, but for this to work we think having a moderated group office hours, just based on experience, is very important, maybe the most important thing for this entire class, so we've made this a requirement to stay in the course. Weekly company updates, sometime this week you should actually sit down and think with your other co-founders about a goal for Startup School that is at least one key metric that defines what success is to you by the end of the 10 weeks.

这听起来很刺耳，但要想工作，我们认为有一个适度的小组办公时间，仅仅是基于经验，是非常重要的，也许是对全班来说最重要的事情，所以我们把这作为一个必须留在课程中的要求。每周一次的公司更新，本周的某个时候，你应该坐下来和你的其他联合创始人一起思考创业学校的一个目标，这个目标至少是一个关键的指标，它定义了在10周结束前你的成功是什么。

This might just be launching your product, but hopefully it's some kind of key metric like monthly recurring revenue, number of active users, and so forth. Each week you will be asked to submit an update of your company, in particular whether you've achieved your weekly goal for this key metric. We find that submitting this adds an extra layer of useful accountability and will help you to drive to accomplish more than you would have otherwise.

这可能只是发布您的产品，但希望它是某种关键指标，比如每月的经常性收入、活跃用户的数量等等。每周你都会被要求提交一份公司的最新信息，特别是你是否达到了你的每周目标。我们发现，提交这增加了一个额外的一层有用的责任，并将帮助你开车去完成比你本来要做的更多的事情。

So please submit this by Tuesday end of day Pacific, excluding this week.

因此，不包括这一周，请在周二结束之前提交这份报告。

The first day I believe is September third. One of the things we're doing new this time and which I'm personally excited about is the community and forum, which some of you may have logged in and already started posting.

我相信第一天是九月三日。我们这次做的新的事情之一，我个人很兴奋的是社区和论坛，你们中的一些人可能已经登录并已经开始发布了。

This is the place where you can talk to fellow founders like yourself, you can poll on for opinions on a variety of matters related to your startups, and ask for help for things like what's the best way to XYZ, and so forth. We've also created a private channel for your group and we think that most of the conversations you'll have will actually be in these private channels.

在这里，你可以和像你这样的创始人们交谈，你可以就与你的初创企业有关的各种问题征求意见，并寻求帮助，比如什么是XYZ的最佳方式，等等。我们还为您的团队创建了一个私人频道，我们认为您将要进行的大部分对话实际上都是在这些私人频道中进行的。

Talking to 10s of 1000s of people will be almost usually ineffective and tough for many topics. One of the first things you do if you haven't already done is log into the software which is live now and introduce yourself to your own group. Basic forum rules apply, be nice, don't spam.

与1000人中的10人交谈对许多话题来说几乎都是无效的和艰难的。如果你还没有做过的话，你做的第一件事就是登录到现在正在运行的软件，并向你自己的团队介绍自己。基本的论坛规则适用，友好，不要垃圾邮件。

I've already had to delete some posts, so try not to do that. Only post things that will be helpful to you and everyone else.

我已经删除了一些帖子，所以尽量不要这样做。只发一些对你和其他人都有帮助的东西。

If you break these rules we unfortunately will have to remove you. Finally, at the end of the course you will have a virtual presentation day where you'll pitch your company via video and slides.

如果你违反了这些规则，不幸的是，我们将不得不删除你。最后，在课程结束时，您将有一个虚拟的演示日，您将通过视频和幻灯片介绍您的公司。

This is where telling the story of your startup is important. Geoff will go over how to do this and how to think about it in a few minutes. While presentation day is actually optional, it's a good way to use this day to set an ambitious goal of what you would like to show off to others in 10 weeks from now.

在这里，讲述你创业的故事是很重要的。杰夫将研究如何做到这一点，以及如何在几分钟内考虑它。虽然演示日实际上是可选的，但这是一个很好的方法，可以利用这一天来设定一个雄心勃勃的目标，即从现在起的10周内，你想要向别人展示什么。

There will be many of you who if you take this seriously will be amazed in 10 weeks but what you can accomplish and what you will be able to present by just setting a goal, holding yourself accountable each week by one, submitting updates and talking about your progress with your group during group office hours.

如果你认真对待这件事，会有很多人在10周内感到惊讶，但只要设定一个目标，每周一个人对自己负责，提交最新情况，并在小组办公时间内与你的团队讨论你的进展，你就能完成什么，以及你能展现什么。

To help us keep the community tight and on track together we will be removing inactive companies unfortunately.

为了帮助我们使社区紧密合作，我们将很不幸地清除不活跃的公司。

So if you don't submit updates and skip group office hours in the first two weeks you will be auditing instead. We want to work with you if you're serious about startup and making progress. Now, some of you may decide this is not the right time to do your startup and that's obviously totally fine.

因此，如果你在头两周不提交更新和跳过小组办公时间，你就会进行审计。如果你对创业和进步很认真的话，我们想和你一起工作。现在，你们中的一些人可能会认为现在不是创业的合适时机，这显然是完全没有问题的。

To officially complete the course, [inaudible] to graduate, you just need to do two things, one is to submit 9 of the 10 weekly updates.

要想正式完成这门课程，(听不到)要毕业，你只需要做两件事，一是提交每周10次更新中的9篇。

Two, is to participate in 9 out of the 10 group office hour sessions and that's it. As you know, as Geoff already mentioned, we are giving out 100 $10k equity-free grants to the most promising startups. Course completion is the minimum requirement to be eligible for these grants. Regardless, if you're aiming for this or not, we believe the success of your startup will increase if you actually complete the course, so regardless, we encourage you to just complete the course. Finally, Geoff kind of already mentioned this, but while Startup School is completely independent from the YC core program, we would love for as many of you to apply to it as possible.

第二，参加10个小组办公时间中的9个，仅此而已。正如你所知，正如杰夫已经提到的，我们将向最有前途的初创公司提供10万美元的免股本赠款。完成课程是获得这些助学金的最低要求。无论如何，如果你的目标是这个或不是，我们相信如果你真的完成课程，你的创业的成功会增加，所以，无论如何，我们鼓励你完成这门课程。最后，Geoff已经提到了这一点，但是虽然StartupSchool完全独立于YC核心项目，但我们希望尽可能多地申请它。

In this vein, as Geoff has pointed out, we have a lecture dedicated to how to create the best application possible and the best practices for the in-person interview should you get one.

在这方面，正如Geoff所指出的，我们有一次讲座专门讨论如何创建最佳应用程序，以及如果您获得面对面面试的最佳实践。

The course just happens to finish just in time for you to apply on time, so we hope to see many of you do so.

这门课程刚好按时完成，你可以按时申请，所以我们希望看到你们中的很多人都能按时申请。


Geoff Ralston: I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about something that I think is absolutely vital to startup success, but although it's fundamental, is often somewhat overlooked.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我只想花几分钟讨论一些我认为对创业成功至关重要的事情，尽管它是基本的，但往往被忽略了。

That is really the invention, the creation of the story of your startup.

这才是真正的发明，创造了你创业的故事。

This mind sound obvious or basic, but it turns out that getting this right is actually non-intuitively important.

这个想法听起来很明显或基本，但事实证明，做正确的事情实际上并不是直觉上的重要。

The reason it is so important is because startups are so hard.

之所以如此重要，是因为初创企业太难了。

They're so very, very hard.

他们太难了。

It is almost certainly going to be the hardest most difficult thing you will do in your professional career.

这几乎可以肯定是你职业生涯中最困难的事情。

If you don't create a story, the right story that you can tell yourself to keep going when things go wrong you'll quit and your startup with die, so it's worthwhile. My YC partner Aaron Harris, who's going to be giving a lecture later on in Startup School thinks and talks a lot about stories and I'm indebted to him for a number of the ideas of what I'm about to say.

如果你不创造一个故事，你可以告诉自己，当事情出了问题，你会退出，你的创业也会随着死亡而去，所以这是值得的。我的YC合伙人亚伦·哈里斯(Aaron Harris)将于稍后在创业学校(StartupSchool)做一次演讲，他思考并谈论了很多故事，我很感激他对我要说的话的一些想法。

There are stories and there are stories and the famous author, E.M. Forster, maybe said it best many, many decades ago when he gave this example. "The king died and then the queen died," is certainly a story, but it's not a very interesting story, is it? It's not a story that grabs you, it's not a story you necessarily care about. But, "the king died and then the queen died of grief," well, there's something there.

有故事，也有故事，著名的作家E.M.福斯特，在很多几十年前他举这个例子的时候也许说得最好。“国王死了，王后死了”，这当然是个故事，但这不是一个很有趣的故事，对吗？这不是一个吸引你的故事，也不是一个你必须关心的故事。但是，“国王死了，王后死了，”嗯，那里有东西。

There's something to grab you, there's something human there, there's something in that story that seems to matter.

有东西可以抓住你，那里有人类的东西，故事里有一些似乎很重要的东西。

It turns out, founders spend a lot of time tell stories.

事实证明，创始人花了很多时间讲故事。

They tell stories about what they're doing.

他们讲述他们在做什么的故事。

They tell stories about the future that they're trying to create.

他们讲述他们试图创造的未来的故事。

They tell stories may originally to their parents, to their friends, to their family, eventually to co-founders, potential customers, partners in the company, investors. But, most of all, they need to tell a story that resonates with themselves.

他们最初可能会向父母、朋友、家人讲述故事，最终可能会向联合创始人、潜在客户、公司合伙人、投资者讲述故事。但是，最重要的是，他们需要讲述一个与自己产生共鸣的故事。

It's a story of your startup that will nourish you, that will keep you going through hard times and setbacks.

这是一个关于你创业的故事，它会滋养你，让你度过难关和挫折。

It's a story that will persuade you to actually do this crazy thing and it's a story that will maybe just for those others persuade them to join you on your journey. How crazy it is to convince someone else to follow you on such an uncertain path.

这是一个能说服你去做这件疯狂事情的故事，也是一个可能只是为了说服其他人加入你的旅程的故事。说服别人跟随你走这样一条不确定的路是多么疯狂啊。

It's not easy, so we actually spend a lot of time at YC helping people craft and sometimes even reimagine their stories.

这并不容易，所以我们实际上花了很多时间在YC帮助人们制作，有时甚至重新想象他们的故事。

I'd strongly recommend that you do these things during these 10 weeks.

我强烈建议你在这10周内做这些事情。

Start with your idea and then as Adora mentioned, create a preferably one sentence, maybe two sentence explanation that is so easy to understand you could stop anyone in the street and they wouldn't just look at you blankly when you're telling them what you do. Create what we call your vertebrae, the framework of your story that captures really what it's all about, and if you were to tell your story you would expect hope that people might just remember because the will not remember your entire story. Create a two minute demo day like pitch, it doesn't have to be exactly two minutes, but create a pitch that captures the essence of your story and communicates those vertebrae in a memorable way. And, last but not least, work with your co-founders so that you're on the same page, so that you all share the same story and can all relate that story, tell that story in a way that's compelling and believable because when you have it right it will be believable. Equally important, it will be memorable and it will I hope sustain you as you go through your path and your journey. Good luck to everyone.

从你的想法开始，然后就像阿多拉提到的，创造一个最好的句子，也许两个句子的解释非常容易理解，你可以阻止街上的任何人，当你告诉他们你所做的事情时，他们不会茫然地看着你。创造我们所说的脊椎骨，你的故事的框架，真实地捕捉它的全部内容，如果你要讲述你的故事，你会希望人们只会记住，因为你的整个故事都不会被记住。创建一个两分钟的演示日，像音高，它不需要确切的两分钟，但创建一个音高，抓住你的故事的精髓，并以一种令人难忘的方式交流这些脊椎骨。最后，但并非最不重要的是，与你的联合创始人合作，让你们在同一页上，这样你们都能分享同样的故事，并且都能把这个故事联系起来，以一种令人信服和可信的方式讲述这个故事，因为当你正确的时候，它将是可信的。同样重要的是，它将是难忘的，我希望它支持你，当你走过你的道路和你的旅程。祝大家好运。

I hope that Startup School helps everyone realize the dream and the company you're creating has a ton of success.

我希望创业学校能帮助每个人实现梦想，你创建的公司也取得了巨大的成功。

So Adora, come on up. We are going to do a quick Q&A.

阿多拉，上来。我们要做一个快速问答。

I just want to say one thing about one part of what Sam talked about which is we'll figure it out. Don't minimize the importance of getting that as part of the fundamental culture of your team.

我只想说一件事，关于山姆谈论的一部分，那就是我们会想出办法的。不要低估作为团队基本文化一部分的重要性。

In fact, as an example, Y Combinator may not appeal to you guys like a startup but it always feels to us like it's a startup even though we're 15 years old now. A week ago, everything went to hell. We had a pretty big problem with Startup School and we weren't quite sure how to deal with it. Our small team sat down together and everyone said, "Well we'll figure out. We're going to let everyone in and we'll figure out how to make it work." Now, you guys will be the judge of how good a job we do figuring it out. We're going to do our very best, but that sort of attitude, this default towards positive action, makes for great startups. Any questions you have we're going to take whatever questions you have, if any.

事实上，作为一个例子，YCombinator可能不会像一家初创公司那样吸引你们，但我们总觉得这是一家初创公司，尽管我们现在15岁了。一周前，一切都变糟了。我们的创业学校有一个相当大的问题，我们不太确定如何处理它。我们的小团队一起坐下来，每个人都说：“好吧，我们会解决的。我们会让每个人都进来的，我们会想出办法让它发挥作用的。”现在，你们将判断我们到底做得有多好。我们会尽我们最大的努力，但这种态度，这种对积极行动的默认态度，会造就伟大的创业公司。如果你有任何问题，我们会回答你的任何问题，如果有的话。

Then we're going to take a short break and then we'll continue with the second lecture today on startup mechanics led by our incredible legal team from Y Combinator who's hiding in the corner over there. Any questions for Adora or myself?
Audience: When should we submit the weekly updates? Should we do it nice and early or should we try to get as much done as possible and wait as late as possible, and submit them close to the deadline if we need?

然后我们休息一会儿，然后继续今天的第二节课，由我们来自Y Combinator的不可思议的法律团队领导，他们躲在那里的角落里。我和阿多拉有什么问题吗？观众：我们应该什么时候提交每周更新？我们应该尽早做好这件事，还是应该尽可能多地完成工作，尽可能晚地等待，如果我们需要的话，应该在最后期限前提交？


Geoff Ralston: Well, look, the updates are for you.

杰夫·拉斯顿：好吧，听着，最新消息是给你的。

The updates are to drive progress in your company.

更新将推动公司的进步。

It's usually better to have an update that is better than worse.

通常情况下，更新要好于坏。

If you think you're going to get five sales between now and the deadline, well get the five sales and have a better update.

如果你认为从现在到截止日期你会有五次销售，那么我们会得到五次销售，并有一个更好的更新。

I would actually, in general, recommend doing them on a pretty consistent temporal basis because that gives you some clue as to your progress, like every week we're going this much. But look, they're a week apart.

总的来说，我建议你在时间上保持一致，因为这给了你一些关于你的进展的线索，就像我们每周都这么做一样。但听着，他们相隔一周。

The importance of a few days is not going to make or break your startup.

几天的重要性不会影响你的创业。

The important thing for the updates is to have a measure that you hold yourself to that really tells you whether you're making progress or not. A startup that doesn't make progress is going nowhere, that's redundant but true. When Chesky, and Nate, and the folks at Airbnb were at YC they used to wake up every morning and see their revenue graph on their bathroom mirror.

对于这些更新来说，最重要的是要有一个你坚持自己的方法，它能真正地告诉你是否正在取得进展。一家没有进步的初创企业是无路可走的，这是多余的，但事实却是如此。切斯基、奈特和Airbnb的员工在YC的时候，他们每天早上醒来都会在浴室的镜子上看到他们的收入图表。

That drove them and it helped, and it worked out for them, so why not you? Questions?
Audience: [inaudible] , but I was wondering [inaudible] ?

这驱使了他们，帮助了他们，为他们成功了，你为什么不呢？问题？观众：(听不见)，但我在想(听不见)？


Geoff Ralston: The question is about AWS credits. You probably missed the beginning, but if you log into the site you can see all of the deals that the companies who are following Startup School get.

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题是关于AWS学分的。你可能错过了开始，但如果你登录到网站，你可以看到所有的公司谁是跟踪创业学校获得的交易。

There was a $1000 of AWS credits for all of the participants.
Audience: What about the group office hours, there's a lot of people in the room who are all from here, so is there a way for us to physically do that? Then, further, we're in San Francisco, so coming down here is harder.

所有参与者都有1000美元的AWS学分。观众：那么小组办公时间呢？房间里有很多人都是从这里来的，那么我们有办法在身体上做到这一点吗？然后，我们在旧金山，所以来这里比较困难。

I get more out of being in a room with other people than I do on the internet.

和别人在一起比上网更能让我受益。


Adora Cheung: If you just look at who's in your group and see where they are-

张朵拉：如果你看看你的小组里有谁，看看他们在哪里-


Geoff Ralston: Can you repeat the question because I'm not [inaudible] .

杰夫·拉斯顿：你能重复一下这个问题吗？因为我没有(听不见)。


Adora Cheung: Sorry, so the question is should we be doing group office hours in person, and if so, how do we go about doing that. We encourage, because most people are distributed, is to do them through the video chat online.

张朵拉：对不起，问题是我们应该亲自做小组工作时间吗？如果是的话，我们该如何做呢？。我们鼓励，因为大多数人是分布式的，就是通过在线视频聊天。

That assures we just click it and you're in.

这保证了我们只要点击它，你就可以加入了。

If you do want to do in person that's up to you, but that's something you should work with your group on.

如果你真的想亲自去做，那取决于你自己，但这是你应该和你的团队一起做的事情。


Geoff Ralston: Yes?
Audience: If you're having issues with your account who should you contact? So [inaudible] .

杰夫·拉斯顿：是吗？观众：如果你的帐户有问题，你应该联系谁？所以[听不见]。


Geoff Ralston: If you're having issues with your account, who should you contact.

杰夫·拉斯顿：如果你的账户有问题，你应该联系谁。


Adora Cheung: If you're having issues with your account you should email startupschool@ycombinator.com.

张：如果你对你的帐户有问题，你应该发电子邮件给StartupSchool@yCombinator.com。


Geoff Ralston: Yes?
Audience: How will you evaluate who gets the $10,000?

杰夫·拉斯顿：是吗？观众：你将如何评价谁会得到1万美元？


Geoff Ralston: The question is how will we choose the 100 companies who get the $10,000. As Adora pointed out, the first criterion that we'll look at is did you actually complete the requirements of the course.

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题是我们将如何选择获得1万美元的100家公司。正如阿多拉所指出的，我们要看的第一个标准是你是否真的完成了课程的要求。

If you do that then we're going to take a number of measures to see who's the most promising.

如果你这样做，那么我们将采取一些措施，看看谁是最有希望的。

It's kind of what we do at Y Combinator, we're always trying to judge who's the most promising.

这是我们在Y组合公司做的事情，我们总是试图判断谁是最有前途的。

So we're going to look at everyone who graduated and everyone's status updates and we'll talk to moderators and we'll look at the information we have about the company, and then make judgments as to who we think is most likely to be able to take that $10,000 and do something useful with it. Yes, in the back?
Audience: I'm [inaudible] and we have [inaudible] job and on this.

所以我们要看看每个毕业的人，每个人的状态更新，我们会和主持人谈谈，我们会看看我们拥有的关于公司的信息，然后判断我们认为谁最有可能拿出1万美元，用它做一些有用的事情。是的，在后面？观众：我是(听不见的)，我们有[听不见的]工作，在这个问题上。


Adora Cheung: Can you stand up-

张朵拉：你能站起来吗-


Geoff Ralston: Can you stand up and speak more loudly please?
Audience: [inaudible] .

杰夫·拉斯顿：你能站起来大声一点吗？观众：[听不见]。

So [inaudible] I just want to understand [inaudible] .

所以[听不见]我只想理解[听不见]。


Geoff Ralston: I think the question was if you're working part-time on your company because you have to work full-time how do you stack up.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我想问题是，如果你在你的公司兼职工作，因为你必须全职工作，那你该怎么办呢？

I think the hard answer is there's few startups that are successful working part-time. Eventually, if you're not full-time the likelihood that you're going to create an epic company by working a few hours a week, even if you're amazing and you're working 40 hours a week at one job and 40 hours a week in another, your probability of success is pretty low. Can you guys think of any company, any amazing company where part-time founders actually made it amazing? So I think the question really isn't to us, it's to you, how successful can you make your startup working part-time? I think you can get it going, but at some point in the evolution of your startup you're going to have to commit to it if you want to make that startup real. Yes?
Audience: [inaudible] .

我认为最难的答案是，很少有创业公司是成功的兼职工作。最终，如果你不是全职的话，你每周工作几个小时就能创造出一家伟大的公司，即使你令人惊奇，每周在一份工作上工作40小时，在另一份工作中每周工作40小时，你成功的可能性是相当低的。你们能想到任何一家公司，任何一家令人惊叹的公司吗？所以我认为这个问题真的不是我们的问题，而是你的问题，你能成功地让你的创业公司非全时工作吗？我认为你可以做到这一点，但在创业的发展过程中，如果你想让创业成为现实，你就必须致力于它。是观众：[听不见]。


Geoff Ralston: There is really no such thing.

杰夫·拉斯顿：真的没有这样的事情。

The question was about the advisor track program.

问题是关于顾问轨道计划。

There's really no such thing.

根本就没有这样的东西。

There's one program with all 15,000 companies and we're going to try to make the program as identical for everyone as possible. Everyone's going to have a group.

所有15，000家公司都有一个项目，我们将努力使这个程序尽可能地对每个人都一样。每个人都会有一个小组。

Some groups have a built-in moderator, some don't and have to add their moderator. Look, we think that's going to work out very well. We'll find out.

一些团体有一个内置的版主，有些没有并且必须增加他们的版主。听着，我们认为这会很好。我们会查出来的。

It's going to depend on you all, for the folks who choose to be moderators to take it seriously and to create a community and a useful group that actually helps folks as they have their encounter sessions, as they talk about progresses, they talk about problems. We think that one of the most important things for startup success is actually to have a community of folks to whom you can talk. Just having that community can be one of those things that does, with your story, sustain you as you build your startup. Yes?
Audience: About the weekly progress metric, do you have any good examples for metrics of companies that are far from [inaudible] ?

这将取决于你们所有人，对于那些选择担任主持人的人来说，他们会认真对待这一问题，并创建一个社区和一个有用的团体，在他们进行接触时帮助他们，在他们谈论进展的时候，他们谈论问题。我们认为，创业成功最重要的事情之一，实际上是有一个社区的人，你可以交谈。只要有了这样的社区，就能在你建立创业公司的过程中，通过你的故事来支撑你。是观众：关于每周进度指标，你有什么很好的例子来衡量远远没有(听不见的)公司吗？


Adora Cheung: The question is if you haven't launched yet what should be a good weekly metric.

张朵拉：问题是，如果你还没有推出什么应该是一个好的每周指标。

The obvious number one thing you could go after is number of days until public launch, that way the way you make progress over the weeks is the technical milestones that you need to hit, like one, two, three, and four to get to that. Hopefully, by the end of 10 weeks you're able to launch it to either a set of private beta users or to the world. Beyond that, someone asked this in a forum too, in you're in private beta right now what's a good metric, also number of days to public launch, but also, for example, number of active users using or some engagement metric that shows that people are loving what you're building.

最明显的问题是，在上市前的几天内，你所取得的进展就是你需要达到的技术里程碑，比如一、二、三和四。希望在10周结束时，你可以将它发布到一组私人测试版用户或世界上。除此之外，还有人在一个论坛上问这个问题，你现在私下测试中，什么是一个好的指标，也是公开发布的天数，但是，例如，使用的活跃用户的数量，或者显示人们喜欢你正在构建的东西的一些参与度量。


Geoff Ralston: Just to follow, one good rule is just to launch earlier than you think you should. Now, there are exceptions to that.

杰夫·拉斯顿：只是为了遵循，一个好的规则就是比你认为应该的早发射。现在，也有例外。

If you're Theranos and your thing doesn't work, not a good idea.

如果你是塞拉诺斯，你的东西不管用，那不是个好主意。

So there are exceptions, but in general, you should launch sooner than you think you should. Yes?
Audience: For the weekly updates, can you explain what you mean by value and growth percentage? I guess value's just a number, right, so it's very arbitrary.

所以也有例外，但是一般来说，你应该比你想的更早启动。是观众：对于每周的更新，你能解释一下你所说的价值和增长率是什么意思吗？我想价值只是一个数字，对吧，所以它很武断。


Geoff Ralston: The question was on the weekly updates and what we mean by value.

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题在于每周的更新以及我们所说的价值是什么。

I don't think it's arbitrary at all.

我不认为这是武断的。

If it's revenue it should be a real number, if it's users it's a real number.

如果是收入，那应该是实数，如果是用户，则是实数。

The reason we're not prescriptive about what that should be is because it depends so much on the stage of your startup, the sort of startup you have. What we encourage you to do is try to figure out what metric is most likely to be representative of success. What actually tells you that things are going well? It's not a fake one.

我们之所以没有明文规定这应该是什么，是因为它在很大程度上取决于你的创业阶段，也就是你拥有的初创公司。我们鼓励你做的是努力找出什么指标最有可能代表成功。究竟是什么告诉你事情进展顺利？不是假的。

The number that happens to be the biggest every week, but actually doesn't really represent whether things are going well, you're getting a ton of registrations, people are signing up for your product but no one's using it, so you use registrations as your metric, you might think that's impressing us, but in the end, you're just waving your hands around something that's not working.

这个数字碰巧是每周最大的，但实际上并不代表事情进展顺利，你得到了大量的注册，人们正在注册你的产品，但没有人使用它，所以你使用注册作为你的度量，你可能会认为这给我们留下了深刻的印象，但最终，你只是在挥动你的手，不起作用的东西。

In that case, for example, maybe active users was a better metric to use. Yes?
Audience: Sorry to ask another question, we're a hardware company, so the nature of what we're doing is that we're making something physical. What is a useful hardware metric that you've seen over time that might be different than we've already talked about?

例如，在这种情况下，活动用户可能是一个更好的使用标准。是观众：很抱歉，我们问了另外一个问题，我们是一家硬件公司，所以我们所做的事情的本质是，我们正在做一些实际的事情。随着时间的推移，您所看到的一个有用的硬件度量标准可能与我们已经讨论过的不同之处是什么？


Geoff Ralston: The question was what metric makes sense for hardware companies. Look, we fund lots of hardware companies. One of our partners, Eric Migicovsky founded Pebble. He'd probably be much better than I would be at answering that question, but every company, hardware, software, hard tech, if you're building YC company boom, a supersonic airplane, still makes progress.

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题是什么度量对硬件公司来说是有意义的。听着，我们资助了很多硬件公司。我们的合伙人之一埃里克·米基科夫斯基创立了鹅卵石。他可能会比我更擅长回答这个问题，但每一家公司，硬件，软件，硬技术，如果你正在建设YC公司的繁荣，超音速飞机，仍然取得进展。

If you're not making progress what exactly are you doing? It might be that you're trying to find a factory in China to manufacture your product, so maybe you've made progress on that deal. Maybe it's in the design of the product, so the milestone is we've completed the design of the wing or the engine. Again, I will default to what I've said before, there is some way that your project, your company, your product is proceeding on a path towards success. Along that path there will be important milestones, those should be your metrics. We have a lot more questions.

如果你没有取得进展，你到底在做什么？可能是你想在中国找一家工厂来生产你的产品，所以也许你已经在那笔交易上取得了进展。也许这是在产品的设计，所以里程碑是我们已经完成了机翼或发动机的设计。再一次，我会默认我之前说过的话，你的项目，你的公司，你的产品都走上了成功的道路。沿着这条路，将会有重要的里程碑，这些应该是你的指标。我们还有很多问题要问。

I'm just going to take, I apologize, a couple more questions because I want to give everyone a bio break and I want to move to the next section, so just a couple more. Yes?
Audience: [inaudible] do you think that a lot of feedback we can get from [inaudible] can be helpful.

我要回答，我道歉，还有几个问题，因为我想让大家休息一下，我想转到下一节，所以再问几个问题。是观众：(听不见的)你认为我们能从(听不到的)那里得到很多反馈是有帮助的吗？

Is there [inaudible] can be very helpful for our startup?

有没有(听不见的)对我们的创业很有帮助？


Adora Cheung: The question is how can you connect with YC alumni and partners to get feedback. A lot of alumni, at least over 100, are actually in the forum and they'll be answering your questions. Jeff and I will also be in the forum. We are YC partners, so hopefully that covers that. We'll also have AMAs with other YC partners, for example, Eric from Pebble will be doing something for the hardware startups, so we'll have those interactions as well.

张德华：问题是你如何与YC校友和合作伙伴联系，以获得反馈。很多校友，至少超过100人，实际上在论坛上，他们会回答你的问题。杰夫和我也将参加论坛。我们是YC的合作伙伴，希望这能解决这个问题。我们还将与其他YC合作伙伴进行AMA，例如，Pe球公司的Eric将为硬件初创公司做一些事情，因此我们也将进行这些交互。


Geoff Ralston: Look, it's a great question.

杰夫·拉斯顿：听着，这是个很棒的问题。

There's a lot of you out there.

你们很多人都在外面。

There's 15,000 companies, so we can only give so much feedback, but the whole point of startup school is to try to give YC knowledge to everyone who can make use of it. We'll do our very best to do exactly that. All right, one more question, yes?
Audience: Can you repeat what you meant by vertebrae regarding the [inaudible] ?

有15，000家公司，所以我们只能给出这么多的反馈，但是创业学校的全部意义是尝试把YC的知识传授给每一个能够利用它的人。我们会尽最大努力做到这一点。好吧，再问一个问题，好吗？观众：你能重复一下脊椎骨的意思吗？


Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。

The question is, can I repeat what I meant by the vertebrae of your story.

问题是，我能不能重复一下我所说的你故事的脊椎骨。

The way I usually think about that is let's say you meet an investor and give them a little two minute pitch for your story, you have to remember that they're going to hear lots, and lots, and lots of pitches.

我通常是这么想的，假设你遇到一个投资者，给他们两分钟的介绍你的故事，你必须记住他们会听到很多，很多的投球。

They're not going to remember your entire two minute pitch.

他们不会记得你整整两分钟的投球。

They're probably going to remember three or four things from that pitch.

他们可能会记住三四件事。

The vertebrae, the three or four things you want them to remember, if you build a story and the focus is on something like they walk away saying, "Oh, he's from San Mateo," who cares? What you really want them to remember is we're growing at 30% every week and this market is a gigantic market and our product solves an incredibly important problem for somebody.

脊椎骨，你想让他们记住的三四件事，如果你建立了一个故事，重点就像他们离开时说，“哦，他来自圣马提奥，”谁在乎呢？你真正希望他们记住的是，我们每周增长30%，这个市场是一个巨大的市场，我们的产品解决了一个令人难以置信的重要问题。

The vertebrae are the key elements around which you build a story.

脊椎骨是建立故事的关键要素。

The vertebrae are the elements that are the memorable ones of what you're building and that comprise really the essence of your story. Hope that helps. Look, we're going to take a 12 minute break and start again at 11:20.

脊椎骨是你所建立的那些令人难忘的元素，也是你故事的精髓所在。希望能帮上忙。听着，我们要休息12分钟，11点20分重新开始。

There's coffee and snacks in there and the bathrooms are over there.

里面有咖啡和小吃，洗手间在那边。

Thank you.

谢谢。
