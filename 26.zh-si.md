# After PMF: People, Customers, Sales by Mathilde Collin

Geoff Ralston: Following on from Paul's talk about some of the ways to think about becoming or  what it takes to become, or whether you might believe you might become $100 billion  business. I am going to have a conversation with Mathilde Collin who is in the  process of building one of those $100 billion businesses and she's going to be able  to tell us all about that and her company called Front so Mathilde, what Patreon  were you in at YC?

Geoff Ralston: 在保罗的演讲之后，他谈到了如何思考成为什么样的人，或者你是否相信你可能会成为1000亿美元的生意。我要和玛蒂尔德·科林(Mathilde Collin)谈一谈，他正在建立1000亿美元的业务，她将能够告诉我们关于这件事的所有事情，她的公司叫做“前线”(Front So Mathilde)，你在YC工作的是什么帕特伦(Patreon)？

Mathilde Collin: Summer 14.

Mathilde Collin:夏天14号。

Geoff Ralston: Summer 14 Wow already four years ago. So tell us about if you would your  journey to being the CEO of Front.

Geoff Ralston: 四年前的夏天了。所以，告诉我们你是否愿意成为前沿的首席执行官。

Mathilde Collin: Sure. In just a few seconds so I think I've always been wanting to start  a company but the main thing is I didn't feel confident enough to think that  I would one day build a company so I was hearing all these people saying,  “Oh yeah, I'll start a company”. And I was like, “I wish I could say  that but I just don't feel like a can do it”. Instead, what I did  is after I graduated, I joined a startup that was super small, doing a contract  management software and that's when I discovered the world of softwares.
There is something that  went well during this first experience in something that didn't do well so what went  well is I became very passionate about software is in general, and I just felt  like the fact that you could build something in a few months that could change  how people work and people spend so much time at work, I felt was super  rewarding.
That's what went well.

Mathilde Collin:当然。在短短几秒钟内，我想我一直都想创办一家公司，但最重要的是，我没有足够的自信，以为有一天我会建立一家公司，所以我听到所有这些人说，“哦，是的，我要开一家公司。”我说，“我真希望我能这么说，但我只是觉得自己做不到”。相反，我所做的就是毕业后，我加入了一个非常小的创业公司，做一个合同管理软件，那时我发现了软件的世界。在这第一次经历中，有一些事情做得并不好，所以我对软件总体上非常有热情，我只是觉得你可以在几个月内建立一些东西来改变人们的工作方式，人们花那么多时间在工作上，我觉得这是非常有价值的。一切都进行得很顺利。

Geoff Ralston: So you didn't find ... Contract management sounds painful boring.

Geoff Ralston: 所以你没找到.合同管理听起来很无聊。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah. So it's super boring.

Mathilde Collin: 是的。所以这太无聊了。

Geoff Ralston: But what was cool about it was that it actually changed how people did their  daily work.

Geoff Ralston: 但最酷的是，它实际上改变了人们日常工作的方式。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, exactly and so when I was talking to people ... I was in charge  of launching a new product for them and so when I was talking to people  using the product and they were telling me how their day to day was much  better because they were using the product it made sense to me and it's still  one thing that drives me today so that's what was great. What wasn't great is  the culture was terrible and so I was very unhappy. I also understood how much  of a responsibility you had, as a founding team of a company to create an  environment where people would be happy to come to work. A year after I joined  this company I quit this company, and-

Mathilde Collin:是的，我和别人说话的时候.我负责为他们推出一款新产品，所以当我和使用这款产品的人交谈时，他们告诉我，他们每天的生活都要好得多，因为他们在使用这个产品，这对我来说是有意义的，今天仍然是驱动我的一件事，所以这才是最棒的。不太好的是文化糟透了，所以我很不开心。我也明白，作为一家公司的创始团队，你有多大的责任去创造一个让人们乐于来工作的环境。在我加入这家公司一年后，我离开了这家公司，然后-

Geoff Ralston: Can you elaborate a little bit what was it about the culture that was bad.

Geoff Ralston: 你能再详细介绍一下文化的坏方面是什么吗？

Mathilde Collin: I think the main thing is, there was no transparency and so then there is  no trust and then there is no engagement from employees so I can tell you  more about how I've built Front and I think what's unique about our culture, but  one of the things is how transparent we are and I don't believe that transparency  is good in itself and that's why you should be transparent. I believe that that's  the most efficient way I've found to create engagement and skill so if you ask  people at Front, why are you happy to come to work every day? They will  tell you, “I'm happy because I can see the impact of my work and that's  what I care about”. How do you make sure that people see the impact of  their work? You make sure that everything is transparent from where you want to go,  how you'll go there, what are the goals that they need to achieve, and how  their work relate to these goals.

Mathilde Collin:我认为最重要的是，没有透明度，也就没有信任，也没有员工的参与，所以我可以更多地告诉你们，我是如何建立阵线的，我认为我们的文化有什么独特之处，但有一件事是，我们是多么的透明，我不认为透明度本身是好的，这就是为什么你应该透明。我相信这是我发现的最有效的方式来创造参与和技能，所以如果你问前线的人，你为什么高兴每天来工作？他们会告诉你，“我很高兴，因为我能看到我的工作的影响，这是我关心的”。你如何确保人们看到他们工作的影响？你要确保每件事都是透明的，从你想去的地方，你将如何去做，他们需要实现的目标是什么，以及他们的工作与这些目标的关系。

Geoff Ralston: It seems like there's something really fundamental there for the companies that are going to  be successful. Paul talked about what felt like a Google where everyone knew where they  were going, and everyone was passionate. Everyone believed and so you had this energy in  the company. I guess somehow this is about sharing vision with the team and having  them believe in it and every step of the way having them be able to  see how that vision is being created.

Geoff Ralston: 对于那些即将取得成功的公司来说，似乎有些东西是非常重要的。Paul谈到了谷歌的感觉，每个人都知道自己要去哪里，每个人都很热情。每个人都相信，所以你在公司里有这种能量。我想这是为了和团队分享愿景，让他们相信它，让他们能够看到这个愿景是如何被创造出来的。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so I think there are two things that are incredibly important as early as  you are so one is the vision and of course, you should know where you're  going and of course, you don't know yet and that's totally fine. Like I didn't  know four years ago how a big Front would be and I still don't know  today, but I think we'll just evolve along the way, what you need to have  is just what you deeply believe in and so what I've always believed is Front  should be a place where people come to work every day and are happy and  our customers should be happier because they use Front either because the impact of their  work is higher or because it's an email products that they spend hours in the  app every day.
That's what drove me and so today our mission is work happier  and I make sure that I explain to people what it means for us and  I think it should be clear to everyone in your company and to you why  you care so deeply about what you're doing any doesn't need to be this huge  idea because the truth is, I didn't know what Front would be but I knew  that he cared so much about it, and people could relate to it so that's  one thing super important yet I don't think that that's the most important thing. I  think the most important thing is discipline and I think that discipline is actually more  important than having a grand vision and my personal belief and I'm sure that not  a lot of people agree with me is one of the reason why we've been  successful so far is because we've been incredibly disciplined in many things. For example, always  having one focus and making sure that it's clear to the entire company so in  the early days, we wanted to make sure that we were making something that people  wanted and the way we would track that was, can we generate revenue and so  every single day everyone in the company would know where our revenue was, and the  next day where it was and the next day it's a track for at least  a year and anything that we would work on was aimed at increasing that revenue  and I was sending daily emails that became weekly emails, there are still weekly emails  telling everyone how we're doing against our core targets and I think having these discipline  of focusing on a few things and making sure that in every presentation you're doing,  every email you send, even to investors to whatever you show that will be one  of the key to succeed.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我认为有两件事是非常重要的，因为你这么早的时候，一个是远景，当然，你应该知道你要去哪里，当然，你还不知道，这很好。就像四年前我不知道大前线会是怎样，我今天也不知道，但我认为我们会沿着这条路前进，你需要拥有的正是你深深相信的东西，所以我一直相信的是，前线应该是一个人们每天上班都很开心的地方，我们的客户应该更快乐，因为他们使用Froner，要么是因为他们的工作影响更大，要么是因为它是他们每天花几个小时在应用程序上的电子邮件产品。这就是驱使我的原因，所以今天我们的任务是更快乐地工作，我确保我向人们解释它对我们意味着什么，我认为你公司里的每个人都应该清楚，为什么你如此关心你正在做的事情，不需要这么大的想法，因为事实是，我不知道前线会是什么样子，但我知道他非常关心这件事，人们可以理解这一点，所以这是一件非常重要的事情，但我不认为这是最重要的事情。我认为最重要的是纪律，我认为纪律实际上比有一个宏伟的愿景和我个人的信念更重要，我相信没有多少人同意我的观点，这也是我们取得成功的原因之一，因为我们在很多事情上都受到了令人难以置信的约束。例如，总是有一个焦点，并确保整个公司都很清楚，所以在最初的日子里，我们想要确保我们做的是人们想要的东西，以及我们跟踪的方式，那就是，我们能创造收入吗？所以公司里的每个人每天都知道我们的收入在哪里，第二天-第二天和第二天-这是至少一年的跟踪，我们要做的任何事情都是为了增加收入，我每天都会发电子邮件，然后变成每周一次的电子邮件。每周都有电子邮件告诉每个人，我们是如何实现我们的核心目标的，我认为有这样的纪律：专注于一些事情，并确保在你所做的每一次演讲中，你发送的每一封电子邮件，甚至是你展示给投资者的任何一封，这都将是成功的关键之一。

Geoff Ralston: Let's back up before we dig further into the sort of the unique culture and  the success you've had at Front you left the lousy startup lousy company with a  lousy culture and somehow you ended up deciding your going to start your own thing  how did that transpire? What led you to start your company to find your co  founder Laurent and get going with Front?

Geoff Ralston: 让我们回到过去，在深入挖掘那种独特的文化和你在前线取得的成功之前，你离开了一家糟糕的创业公司，有着糟糕的文化，不知怎么你最终决定要开始你自己的事情是什么促使你开始你的公司，找到你的联合创始人劳伦特，并开始与前线？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so I think I was very lucky for a few reasons, one is I  met my co founder.
The story of my co founder and I is not that  we were best friends or brothers and sisters or whatever. I actually met my co  founder three months before we started the company and then we spend so much time  together trying to go through every hard conversations that I could think about. Like, I  don't know what if I want to fire you? What if you want to fire  me? What if you want to sell and I don't want to sell and blah  blah blah? And we were just aligned on most things, actually everything so that's one  thing that led me to start this company with him.
Then we found-

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我觉得我很幸运，有几个原因，一个是我遇到了我的联合创始人。我和我的共同创始人的故事并不是说我们是最好的朋友、兄弟姐妹等等。实际上，在我们成立公司前的三个月里，我和我的联合创始人见过面，然后我们花了那么多时间在一起，试图完成我能想到的每一次艰难的谈话。我不知道如果我想炒了你怎么办？如果你想解雇我呢？如果你想卖，我不想卖，那又怎么样？我们在大多数事情上都是一致的，实际上是所有的事情，所以这是促使我和他一起创办这家公司的原因之一。然后我们发现-

Geoff Ralston: So you knew you wanted to start a company?

Geoff Ralston: 那么你知道你想开一家公司？

Mathilde Collin: Yes. So I knew I wanted to start a company. I quit the software company.  I knew I wanted to start a company in the email space, because I love  software's but I was using email to get work done. I wasn't using contracts and  so I knew that and I knew that I needed money to start a company  because I had to have a loan for my school and so I couldn't start  a company if I didn't find money and so I was lucky enough to meet  with an angel investor in Paris who committed to giving us money so franchise-

Mathilde Collin:是的。所以我知道我想开一家公司。我退出了软件公司。我知道我想在电子邮件空间创建一家公司，因为我喜欢软件，但我用电子邮件来完成工作。我没有用合同，所以我知道，我需要钱来创办一家公司，因为我不得不贷款给我的学校，所以如果我找不到钱，我就不能创办一家公司，所以我很幸运地在巴黎遇到了一位天使投资人，他承诺给我们这样的特许经营权-

Geoff Ralston: Sounds really risky though, you had college debt, you had just left your job and-

Geoff Ralston: 听起来很冒险，你有大学债务，你刚刚离开工作，然后-

Mathilde Collin: Yeah. I don't know if that's the biggest risk I took or when I moved  here with all of our employees and their family and they quit their jobs and  sold their house I've taken many are risks in my life.

Mathilde Collin:是的。我不知道这是否是我最大的风险，或者当我和我们所有的员工和他们的家人搬到这里，他们辞掉了工作，卖掉了自己的房子，我承担了很多生命中的风险。

Geoff Ralston: Right. Wow, so you decided to jump in headlong. You had to get money. You  got an angel investor, you found Laurent.

Geoff Ralston: 对。哇，所以你决定直接跳进去。你得去拿钱。你有天使投资人你找到洛朗了。

Mathilde Collin: Yes, and the last thing that I think is incredibly important is I found someone  that became my husband later on, who believed in me and I think that it's  so important to find someone, whether it's a mentor, friend, or whoever, who can tell  you that you can do it and maybe you already know that you can do  it but at least for me, like these four things were equally important. I would  have never started this company. If someone was telling me every day, you can do  it.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我认为最重要的是我找到了一个后来成为我丈夫的人，他相信我，我认为找到一个人非常重要，无论是导师、朋友，还是其他人，谁能告诉你能做到，也许你已经知道你能做到，但至少对我来说，这四件事同样重要。我就不会创办这家公司了。如果有人每天都告诉我，你可以做到的。

Geoff Ralston: So you found your future husband and your co founder, different people, by the way,  at about the same time-

Geoff Ralston: 所以你找到了你未来的丈夫和你的共同创始人，不同的人，顺便说一句，大约在同一时间-

Mathilde Collin: Although my husband works at Front.

Mathilde Collin:虽然我丈夫在前线工作。

Geoff Ralston: Although your husband does work, but you met them at this ... He didn't work  in Front at the time and you met them about the same time-

Geoff Ralston: 虽然你丈夫工作，但你在这里遇到了他们.他当时不在前线工作，而你也是在同一时间认识他们的-

Mathilde Collin: No I met my future husband a few years before, but he was the one  telling me you can do it at that time.

Mathilde Collin:不，我几年前见过我未来的丈夫，但他告诉我，那时你能做到。

Geoff Ralston: He was supportive of you quitting your job and jumping in headlong into the startup.

Geoff Ralston: 他支持你辞去工作，直接进入创业公司。

Mathilde Collin: Yes, and he did the same thing at the same time.

Mathilde Collin:是的，他同时也做了同样的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Right, and how did you meet Laurent?

Geoff Ralston: 对，你是怎么认识洛朗的？

Mathilde Collin: So in Paris we met in startup to do called the eFounders and it was  love at first sight.

Mathilde Collin:因此，在巴黎，我们在初创公司遇到了名为eFounders的人，这是一见钟情。

Geoff Ralston: How How did the two of you decide who was going to be CEO?

Geoff Ralston: 你们两个是如何决定谁将成为首席执行官的？

Mathilde Collin: That was very easy, basically everything I love He hates and everything he loves I  hate so he's the CTO of Front, he loves building the product but it doesn't  like doing-

Mathilde Collin:这很容易，基本上所有我喜欢的东西，他讨厌的东西，他爱的东西，所以他是前线的首席技术官，他喜欢制造产品，但它不喜欢做-

Geoff Ralston: Talking to people.

Geoff Ralston: 和人说话。

Mathilde Collin: What I'm doing right now. He doesn't like managing as much and I think that  when I reflect back on Front the thing that I've been most lucky with is  my relationship with my co founder because we have the most amazing relationship and what  I mean by that is not that we're super close in the sense that we  would hang out together, he is actually is a friend but he is not like  my best friend or my buddy, but we have so much respect for one another  and that's the thing that you need to optimize for. It doesn't matter how well  you get along, you just need to be so impressed by whatever your other person  or other persons are doing.

Mathilde Collin:我现在做什么。他不太喜欢管理，我想当我回到前线的时候，我最幸运的是我和我的联合创始人的关系，因为我们有着最令人惊奇的关系，我的意思是，这并不是说我们非常亲密，因为我们会在一起，他其实是一个朋友，但他不像我最好的朋友或我的伙伴，但我们有如此多的尊重对方，这是你需要优化的东西。不管你相处得有多好，你只要对你的其他人或其他人所做的一切都留下深刻的印象。

Geoff Ralston: You had sort of a unique process to figure that out in the beginning, you  sort of grilled each other until you were both sure that you were compatible.

Geoff Ralston: 在开始的时候，你们有一个独特的过程来解决这个问题，你们互相盘问，直到你们都确信你们是相容的。

Mathilde Collin: Right.

Mathilde Collin:对。

Geoff Ralston: When you began as CEO, can you talk a little bit about how you split  up responsibilities and what the role of CEO was, there's a lot of people here  who have similar questions as to what exactly they should be doing as CEO, how  did you think about that from the beginning?

Geoff Ralston: 当你开始做CEO的时候，你能不能谈谈你是如何划分责任的，以及CEO的角色是什么，这里有很多人都有类似的问题，他们到底应该做什么，作为CEO，你从一开始是怎么想的？

Mathilde Collin: Few things who my role as a CEO in the early days, I was basically  doing everything but being an engineer because I wasn't an engineer, so I was the  product manager the recruiter I was for the longest time the only marketing person for  three years, I was the only sales rep, I was the only support rep. I  was the only customer success person and I guess my job was just to do  the job of like, which ultimately will become our team and that was really what  my goal was.

玛蒂尔德·科林(Mathilde Collin)：在我最初担任CEO的时候，我做过的事情很少，我只是做一名工程师，因为我不是工程师，所以我是产品经理-我做了很长一段时间的招聘人员-三年来唯一的营销人员，我是唯一的销售代表，我是唯一的支持代表。我是唯一的客户成功人士，我想我的工作只是做喜欢的工作，这最终将成为我们的团队，这正是我的目标。

Geoff Ralston: Everything but building, that was you right?

Geoff Ralston: 除了建筑，什么都没有，你说得对吗？

Mathilde Collin: Exactly.

Mathilde Collin:没错。

Geoff Ralston: How has that changed over time? We talked a bit with Ellad Gil about how  the role of CEO evolves as a company gets much larger, but it changes a  lot even as you go from two people to five people to 10 people, right?

Geoff Ralston: 随着时间的推移，情况有了怎样的变化？我们和ElladGil谈过，随着公司规模的扩大，CEO的角色是如何演变的，但是当你从两个人变成五个人到十个人的时候，这个角色也发生了很大的变化，对吧？

Mathilde Collin: True. I think what's super important is I wasn't expecting to hire people to figure  out things that I would have not figured out so it wasn't like I'm struggling  with marketing, like I don't know how to generate leads so I need to hire  someone better than me so the way I was thinking about it is there are  a few things that I feel are scalable so for example, we would have leads  that would send it to Front, I would call them and it would like do  you want to send at Front, here is what from does, what's your process and  when I started to think that another person could do that and could do it  better than me, because the person would be more skilled, then that's when I hired  people and so at every step of the way, I hired people better than me.  Once I had figured out what roughly their job would be in the mistake I've  done in the early days was I have not figured out something and I hoped  that someone will figure it out for me.
The truth is, if with all the  knowledge I have about the company, I can't figure out something. I think it's very  rare that someone would come and figure it out so that's something that I learned  in the early days.

Mathilde Collin:没错。我认为最重要的是，我并没有指望雇佣一些人来找出一些我不知道的事情，所以我并不是在为市场营销而挣扎，就像我不知道如何产生线索，所以我需要雇一个比我更好的人，所以我的想法是，有几件事情我觉得是可伸缩的，例如，我们会有线索把它发送到前线，我会打电话给他们，它会想你想在前线发送，这是FROM做的，你的过程是什么，当我开始认为另一个人可以做的比我更好的时候，因为这个人会更熟练，然后我雇佣了一些人，所以在每一步，我都比我雇用更好的人。一旦我弄清楚他们的工作大概会是什么，我早年所犯的错误就是我没有想出什么，我希望有人能帮我解决这个问题。事实是，如果我对公司有这么多的了解，我就想不出什么办法了。我认为很少有人会来找出答案，所以这是我早年学到的东西。

Geoff Ralston: So you can't count on someone else to have the answers if you don't have  them?

Geoff Ralston: 如果你没有答案，你就不能指望别人知道答案？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, for sure and still today. Even today we are 110 people now and I'm  not hiring people to figure out things that I've not figured out because I think  it's incredibly hard. I'm here to hire people that will scale what's working, so that's  what happened. I hired people that were better than me on things that I had  figured out and then once they had everyone I hired head of functions and then  my job now is to find the head of every function and to make them  work together so that's how my job has evolved.

Mathilde Collin:是的，今天仍然是这样。即使在今天，我们已经有110个人了，我也不会雇佣一些人来搞清楚我还没搞清楚的事情，因为我认为这是非常困难的。我来这里是为了雇佣那些能发挥作用的人，所以事情就是这样发生的。我雇佣了一些比我更优秀的人，这些人都是我想出来的，一旦他们有了我雇来的所有人，我现在的工作就是找到每一个职能的负责人，让他们一起工作，这就是我的工作是如何演变的。

Geoff Ralston: Sounds like from the very beginning, though hiring was foremost in your mind is key  role for the CEO.

Geoff Ralston: 听起来好像是从一开始就开始的，不过招聘是你心目中最重要的，也是首席执行官的关键角色。

Mathilde Collin: So one Funny thing is anytime ... So I was in the summer 14 batch  and so every week we had a speaker and every time the speaker was talking  about hiring, that's the moment I was in my phone because I was like I  don't care hiring is a long time from now on and that's probably a big  mistake I've done because then you understand that hiring is the key. If you fail  on that your company will fail so you should listen and take notes and read  the notes later on so this I can tell you. One piece of advice that  I got from Patrick Collison, the CEO Stripe that I said was super insightful so  he said in the early days, every time you hire someone, just think about whether  you want 10 times this person. Because the truth is, this person will hire people  like them so I'm interviewing you and I'm like, “Do I want 10 Jeff in  this team?” So if the answer is yes-

Mathilde Collin:那么有趣的是，任何时候.所以我是在夏天的第14批，所以每周我们都有一位演讲者，每次演讲者谈论招聘的时候，那是我在手机里的那一刻，因为我觉得从现在起我不关心招聘是很长的一段时间，这可能是我犯的一个大错误，因为你知道招聘是关键。如果你失败了，你的公司就会倒闭，所以你应该听录音，然后再看笔记，这样我就可以告诉你了。我从帕特里克·科里森(PatrickCollison)那里得到了一条建议，我说他的首席执行官斯特里普(Stripe)非常有洞察力，所以他说，在最初的日子里，每次你雇用某人时，只要想一想你是否想要因为事实是，这个人会雇佣像他们这样的人，所以我会面试你，我会说，“我想在这个团队里选10个杰夫吗？”所以如果答案是肯定的-

Geoff Ralston: Maybe no.

Geoff Ralston: 也许不是。

Mathilde Collin: Maybe I do so if the answer is yes, then you can hire you.
The  answer is no, but the bar should be as high as that and I think  that was a good piece of advice that I received.

Mathilde Collin:如果答案是肯定的，那么你可以雇用你。答案是否定的，但标准应该是那样高，我认为这是一个很好的建议，我收到了。

Geoff Ralston: From the very beginning, it seems like Front has a strong specific culture. Did you  pay attention to that as you're hiring from the beginning, and how did you how  did you implement that? How did you think about it?

Geoff Ralston: 从一开始，前线似乎就有着强烈的特殊文化。你从一开始就在招聘的时候就注意到了这一点，你是如何做到的呢？你是怎么想的？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so I think very early on, I was very deliberate about what we call  today our values, but I basically know who I think I would work well with,  and who I wouldn't work well with and that's the truth like our values or  just extensions of who we are as co founders and so some of our values  or low ego and high standard secure and collaboration and the last one is transparency  and I just believe that I'm incredibly demanding and that's why high standard is part  of our value and I don't want to hire anyone that doesn't have the standards  also I think very low ego like it doesn't mean I don't have an ego  but when I make a decision I think about Front first and I think about  our employees first and I think about myself after. I think that just putting words  on what we care about as co founders and then making sure that you're assessing  that during your interview process is what matters it's not useful to display them on  the wall and to explain them and all of that in the early days, but  at least being self aware is what will help you hire the right people.

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我很早就认为，我对我们今天所说的价值观非常谨慎，但我基本上知道我认为我会和谁合作，这是事实，就像我们的价值观，或者我们作为共同创始人的延伸，所以我们的一些价值观，低自我，高标准，安全和合作，最后一个是透明，我只是相信我要求非常高，这就是为什么高标准是我们的价值，我不想雇佣没有标准的人，我认为很低的自我，这并不意味着我没有自我，但是当我做出决定时，我首先想到的是前线，我首先想到的是我们的员工，然后是我自己。我认为，仅仅说说我们作为联合创始人所关心的事情，然后确保你在面试过程中评估这一点才是最重要的-把它们展示在墙上，在最初的日子里解释它们和所有这些都是没有用的，但至少自我意识才能帮助你雇佣合适的人。

Geoff Ralston: And it does speak to the fact that you are going to play an important  role in hiring everybody in the beginning.

Geoff Ralston: 这确实说明了这样一个事实：你在一开始就会在招聘每个人方面扮演重要的角色。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, and I kept interviewing everyone till like employee number 80 or something.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我一直在面试每个人，直到像80号员工之类的。

Geoff Ralston: Did you ever find yourself in a position of needing or wanting or having to  compromise on those values or did the value is always take presence. Like there's there  was someone who maybe didn't quite match the values but was like the perfect fit  for the designer job.

Geoff Ralston: 你是否发现自己处于需要、想要或不得不在这些价值观上妥协的境地？或者，价值总是存在的。就像有一个人，他们可能不完全符合价值，但就像一个完美的适合设计师的工作。

Mathilde Collin: No, we never or if we did then we let go the person after which  is worse-

Mathilde Collin:不，我们从来没有，或者如果我们这样做了，我们就会让那个人走，那之后的情况就更糟了-

Geoff Ralston: Never worked.

Geoff Ralston: 从来没有工作过。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, never worked and I think it's incredibly important in a company that starts growing  for example, I've been willing to hire a head of finance for six months and  it's so important. Like, we don't have any finance person at Front and we are  110 people we've raised 80 million and I don't know what I'm doing because I've  never done any finance work before, but I've never found someone that I was incredibly  excited about that had both the skills and would match our values. I'm not hiring  anyone and I think being very disciplined about not hiring even if you disparately need  this person is important.

Mathilde Collin:是的，从来没有起过作用，我认为在一家刚开始成长的公司里，这是非常重要的-例如，我已经愿意雇佣一个财务主管六个月了，这是非常重要的。就像，我们没有任何财务人员在前线，我们是110人，我们已经筹集了8000万，我不知道我在做什么，因为我从来没有做过任何金融工作，但我从来没有找到一个我非常兴奋的人，有这两种技能，并将符合我们的价值观。我不会雇佣任何人，而且我认为，即使你非常需要这个人，也要遵守纪律，即使你完全需要这个人。

Geoff Ralston: I want to move on to product but before we do that, I'm just saying  wondering if you were going to talk to relatively new startup founders or people with  young companies, like most of the companies and startup school? Is there specific advice you'd  give about creating a culture of success creating the culture you have at Front for  them?

Geoff Ralston: 我想继续研究产品，但在做之前，我只是想知道你是要和相对较新的初创公司创始人谈谈，还是和年轻公司的人交谈，比如大多数公司和创业学校？对于创造一种成功的文化，创造你为他们提供的文化，你会给出具体的建议吗？

Mathilde Collin: I think my biggest advice would be one to be incredibly demanding. I just feel  like in the early days, if you have someone that's not working out being very  tough and letting this person go, I think that's a mistake I've seen because if  you have a team of five and one person is not working out and you  know and you always know, and you're not making this tough decision that it has  an impact on your entire team. It's easy to say hard to do, and I  can tell you how we've done it. I think that's super important. I think transparency  is just so important in the early days, and even at scale, but so making  sure that everyone in your company knows everything. Like there is no reason why you  should hide anything. Maybe except for salaries-

Mathilde Collin:我认为我最大的建议应该是要求高得令人难以置信。我只是觉得在最初的日子里，如果你有一个不太坚强的人，让这个人走了，我认为这是我看到的一个错误，因为如果你有一个五人的团队，一个人没有锻炼，你知道，你一直都知道，你并没有做出这个艰难的决定，因为它对你的整个团队都有影响。很容易说很难做，我可以告诉你我们是如何做到的。我觉得这很重要。我认为透明度在早期非常重要，甚至在规模上也是如此，但是要确保公司里的每个人都知道一切。好像你没有理由隐瞒任何事。也许除了薪水-

Geoff Ralston: I was going to ask when you say transparency, people throw that word out a  lot. In actual practice what does that mean for you at Front?

Geoff Ralston: 我想问一下，当你说透明度的时候，人们会经常把这个词扔出去。在实际的实践中，这对你在前线意味着什么？

Mathilde Collin: It means that everyone knows what I ... Few things when I think there is  bad transparency and good transparency. Good transparency is everything that you can share that will  help people do their job better and help answer questions they have bad transparency will  raise more questions and create more problems than you need for example, like sharing salaries  like we can have a debate about that, but I think it raises more questions  than it can actually solve problems but then everything else, everyone knows or revenue or  churn every email about I don't know leads coming in and telling us where they  want customer complaining about this or being happy about that, every NPS score that is  here either people are super happy, super upset, everything is public, our runway, the amount  of cash we have in the bank account, every board meeting that we do we  publish the board deck, then I do an all hands and I share what the  board said, in order to answer a question on the board deck. I share just  everything that's business related, and also how I feel like I'm happy to say I'm  extremely, extremely happy about that and I'm extremely unhappy about that.

Mathilde Collin:这意味着每个人都知道我.当我认为透明度差、透明度好的时候，几乎没有什么东西。好的透明度是你能分享的一切，它将帮助人们更好地完成他们的工作，帮助回答那些透明度不高的问题，比你所需要的更多的问题和更多的问题，比如分享薪水，就像我们可以就这个问题进行辩论一样，但我认为它提出的问题比实际解决问题的问题要多，但其他的问题都会发生。每个人都知道我不知道的每一封电子邮件，告诉我们他们希望顾客在哪里抱怨或者对此感到高兴，这里的每个NPS评分我们举行的每一次董事会会议-我们公布了董事会甲板，然后我全身心地做了一次，并分享了董事会所说的话，以便在董事会甲板上回答一个问题。我分享所有与商业有关的东西，也分享我对此非常高兴的感觉，我对此非常不高兴。

Geoff Ralston: And every one of the company ends up knowing that.

Geoff Ralston: 公司的每一个人都知道这一点。

Mathilde Collin: And they know that and I think it's good because then if you really want  people to work on this things that are broken, there is no point in hiding  what's broken and there is always this human feeling of I will not share because  they will be worried. I'm going to tell them that that's broken and some people  joined two days ago and they're going to know that it's broken but that's fine  because which again is the fact that they will all work on the problem and  that's better than avoiding the question.

Mathilde Collin:他们知道这一点，我认为这很好，因为如果你真的想让人们在这件被破坏的事情上工作，那就没有必要隐瞒那些坏了的东西，而且我总是有一种人类的感觉，我不会和他们分享，因为他们会担心。我要告诉他们，这是坏的，一些人两天前加入，他们会知道它是坏的，但这是好的，因为这是事实，他们都将致力于这个问题，这比回避这个问题更好。

Geoff Ralston: And it feels like people stay aligned and moving in the same direction.

Geoff Ralston: 这感觉就像人们保持一致，朝着同一个方向移动。

Mathilde Collin: Yes, and I mean, you know that, but I think Front is at least one  there. Let's assume that we struggle with but one thing that we've done, I think  really well is our retention of employees so people are super happy or NPS is  at 87, which is super high. If you look at Glassdoor we only have five  stars reviews, if you look at our attrition, there are just two people that have  left Front ever, and it was one to go back to school, one to join  the company of their best friend, so I think we've done a good job and  I believe that we've done a good job because of this engagement that we've created  thanks to this transparency.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我的意思是，你知道，但我认为前线至少是其中之一。假设我们只做了一件事，我认为我们很好地留住了员工，所以人们非常高兴，或者NPS是87岁，这是非常高的。如果你看玻璃门，我们只有五星级的评论，如果你看看我们的减员，就会有两个人离开前线，一人回到学校，一人加入他们最好的朋友的公司，所以我认为我们做得很好，我相信我们做得很好，因为我们建立了这样的合作关系，这要归功于透明度。

Geoff Ralston: We were talking earlier about one great sign for company's product is having really high  retention, but likewise, I guess having really high retention of your employees is a pretty  fantastic sign for a company.

Geoff Ralston: 我们之前讨论过公司产品的一个很好的标志，那就是有很高的留用率，但同样的，我想对公司来说，员工的留用率很高是一个非常棒的标志。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, and it's so important because there is so much knowledge is gathered.

Mathilde Collin:是的，这很重要，因为有那么多的知识被收集起来。

Geoff Ralston: institutional and especially if you lose someone good, you lose so much.

Geoff Ralston: 体制上的，尤其是如果你失去了一个好的人，你会失去很多。

Mathilde Collin: So much knowledge.

Mathilde Collin:这么多知识。

Geoff Ralston: So you guys are really interesting case because you're an enterprise company that started with  a handful of customers. Well zero, eventually a handful and then you've scaled to thousands.  Can you talk about the early days of figuring out that you had product market  fit and then and then a little bit about the evolution going from we were  just talking about 10 or 100 people who love you to many more.

Geoff Ralston: 所以你们真的很有趣，因为你们是一家以少数客户为起点的企业公司。好吧，零，最终只剩下几个，然后你就可以爬到几千个了。你能谈谈早期发现你的产品市场是否适合，然后一点点的演变，从我们刚刚谈论的10或100人谁爱你到更多。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so, I would say a few, a few things, first thing is, I remember  when I arrived here in YC four years ago Kevin Hale came to me and  was like, “What's your company?” and says, like, “It's Front”. And then it was like,  “Oh, so cool. I think it's one of the coolest company from this batch”. And  then I was sure that he was talking about another company and it's true I  just was-

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以，我想说几件事，首先，我记得四年前我来到YC的时候，凯文·黑尔来找我，他说：“你的公司是什么？”然后说，“这是前线”。然后说，“哦，太酷了。我认为这是这批货中最酷的公司之一“。然后我确定他在说另一家公司，而我只是-

Geoff Ralston: Maybe he was confused about, “Oh you must be confusing me with another company in  the batch”.

Geoff Ralston: 也许他对“哦，你一定是把我和另一家分批的公司搞混了”这件事搞糊涂了。

Mathilde Collin: Its just like I wasn't confident and another example is my batch mates would come  to me and say should we use your product and I was like no use  our competitor it's much better it's truly a just I've always been very ashamed with  the current state of the products so of course convinced that we didn't have product  market fit.

Mathilde Collin:就像我不自信，另一个例子是，我的批次伙伴会来找我说，如果我们使用你们的产品，而我就像不使用我们的竞争对手，那就更好了，我一直对这些产品的现状感到羞愧，所以我们当然相信我们没有适合产品市场的情况。

Geoff Ralston: Is that one of the definitions of product market fit is a product that your  customers love but that you're ashamed of?

Geoff Ralston: “产品市场适合”的定义之一是你的客户喜欢但你感到羞耻的产品吗？

Mathilde Collin: Maybe I think it's actually a good thing that you're ashamed as your product fit  so product market fit at least I can tell you that if you feel like  you don't have product market fit, great doesn't mean that you're doomed but then I  think that there is a lot of things that we ... I'm also someone that's  incredibly honest with myself and I can't just wake up and think that I don't  have product market fit. I need to fix every single problem that they have so  how did they do that? One is I've been incredibly disciplined about talking to as  many users as possible so my day to day at YC four years ago and  I can tell you what my day to day is today but it's not very  different. I was talking to leads and customers all the time and I made sure  that every single day I had at least seven eight meetings with people that sign  up to our product even if they ended up not using our product doesn't matter  I want to talk to them and I want to understand why they got initially  interested.

Mathilde Collin:也许我觉得你感到羞愧是件好事，因为你的产品适合你的产品市场，所以至少我可以告诉你，如果你觉得自己不适合产品市场，那么伟大并不意味着你注定要失败，但我认为有很多事情是我们.我也是一个对自己非常诚实的人，我不能就这样醒来，以为自己没有适合的产品市场。我需要解决他们所有的问题，他们是怎么做到的？其中之一是，我在与尽可能多的用户交谈时受到了令人难以置信的约束，所以四年前我每天在YC工作，我可以告诉你我的日常生活是什么，但这并没有太大的不同。我一直在和领导和客户交谈，我确保每一天我都要和注册我们产品的人至少开七次会，即使他们最终不使用我们的产品也没关系，我想和他们谈谈，我想知道他们最初为什么会对我们的产品感兴趣。

Geoff Ralston: Can I just stop you there do you remember ...
This might be a stretch  but do you remember any specific conversations that may be changed the trajectory or at  least change the product in significant ways?

Geoff Ralston: 我能让你停下来吗？你还记得吗.这可能有点牵强，但你还记得有哪些特定的对话可能会改变产品的发展轨迹，或者至少会以重要的方式改变产品吗？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah and I actually YC ... So we started with this email that was helping  companies manage share inboxes so share email addresses like support@ sales@ and that's what it  was doing, and then we took to Adora the CEO of Homejoy and-

Mathilde Collin:是的，事实上我是YC.所以我们从这封帮助公司管理股票收件箱的电子邮件开始，分享支持“Sales”之类的电子邮件地址，这就是它正在做的事情，然后我们找到了Homejoy公司的首席执行官Adora，然后-

Geoff Ralston: YC partner now?

Geoff Ralston: YC合伙人现在？

Mathilde Collin: YC founder now.

Mathilde Collin:YC的创始人。

Geoff Ralston: YC startup school.

Geoff Ralston: YC创业学校。

Mathilde Collin: Awesome and so she told me, “Oh the product that you've built, it's awesome. Could  it work with SMS?” Because they were chatting through SMS with all their cleaners and  then we looked at TrailO and their API was pretty good and so we realized  that in a week, we could just add SMS as a new channel and it  drove so much revenue, because I think there was a big need for collaboration around  SMS and I would have never thought about it. I've never worked in a company  that use SMS to work, that's one example but I have many more. I basically  have never ... I worked one year in a company so what do I know  about business workflows? Still, today the reason why is to spend a ton of time  talking to either leads or customers is because we're going up market we're going in  new kinds of companies and new use cases and one of the use case that's  super popular in is Logistics and Transportation and so I'm going to this tracking conferences  and trying to understand what do I know, but they're work flows? Nothing.

Mathilde Collin:太棒了，所以她告诉我，“哦，你制造的产品，太棒了。”它能用短信吗？“因为他们和他们的清洁工通过短信聊天，然后我们看了TrailO，他们的API非常好，所以我们意识到，在一周内，我们可以添加SMS作为一个新的频道，它带来了如此多的收入，因为我认为在SMS方面有很大的合作需求，我从来没有想过这一点。我从来没有在一家使用短信工作的公司工作过，这是一个例子，但我有更多。基本上我从来没有.。我在一家公司工作了一年，所以我对业务流程了解多少？尽管如此，今天我们花大量的时间与领导者或客户交谈是因为我们要进入市场-我们要进入新的公司和新的用例-物流和运输是最流行的用例之一，所以我要参加这次跟踪会议，试图了解我知道些什么，但它们是工作流程？没什么

Geoff Ralston: I bet you stand out at a tracking conference.

Geoff Ralston: 我打赌你在一个跟踪会议上一定很突出。

Mathilde Collin: Right, I do so if I don't talk to them, then I can lead the  company in the right way because I can't hire the right people make the right  product decisions and so I just believe that that's what I used to do.
That's  what I still do. I think it's insanely important and the only way you'll manage  to do that is by hustling. Like, the truth is when you're early and you  need to have eight meetings a day, it's insanely difficult and so you need to  do everything you can from reaching out to all the people you know, to finding  new ways to writing content in the hope someone reading and then ultimately signing up  to your product and that's what I did and I think that's what made us  grow quickly in the early days.

Mathilde Collin:对，如果我不和他们说话，我就能以正确的方式领导公司，因为我不能雇佣正确的人，做出正确的产品决策，所以我只是相信这是我过去的做法。我现在还是这么做的。我认为这是非常重要的，你唯一能做到的办法就是匆忙行动。事实上，当你一天要开八次会的时候，这是非常困难的，所以你需要尽你所能去接触所有你认识的人，找到新的方式来写内容，希望有人阅读，然后最终注册你的产品，这就是我所做的，我认为这是我们在早期迅速成长的原因。

Geoff Ralston: When you entered YC, do you remember how many customers you had?

Geoff Ralston: 当你进入YC的时候，你还记得你有多少客户吗？

Mathilde Collin: One thing I remember is when I interviewed at YC we had 3000 companies that  had signed up to our product, but it was closed beta so they were not  using it yet and then I was onboarding them one by one and everything was  the same thing. Great but we don't want to use your product because you don't  have XYZ or it doesn't work so maybe out of the 3000 companies, maybe one  ended up using the product, but that's just how I built so much knowledge about  what they wanted and then I was telling Laurent, need to build that or a  one feature away, I promise.

Mathilde Collin:我记得我在YC面试的时候，我们有3000家公司已经签约了我们的产品，但是它是封闭的测试版，所以他们还没有使用它，然后我一个接一个地使用它，每件事都是一样的。很好，但是我们不想使用你的产品，因为你没有XYZ或者它不工作，所以可能是在3000家公司中，也许其中一家最终使用了该产品，但这正是我如何建立了很多关于他们想要什么的知识，然后我告诉Laurent，需要构建这个或一个功能，我保证。

Geoff Ralston: Just one features.

Geoff Ralston: 只有一个特点。

Mathilde Collin: Just one feature away I still say that today.

Mathilde Collin:还有一个特点，我今天仍然这么说。

Geoff Ralston: And when you left YC how many customers did you have?

Geoff Ralston: 当你离开YC时，你有多少客户？

Mathilde Collin: When we left YC we had 5000 MR and so we had probably like 130  companies using the product.

Mathilde Collin:当我们离开YC的时候，我们有5000先生，所以我们大概有130家公司在使用该产品。

Geoff Ralston: Which is pretty amazing so do you recall what the retention was of those 130  companies?

Geoff Ralston: 这真是太棒了，你还记得那130家公司的留用情况吗？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so we hadn't had a single user churn so basically, the reason why I'm  saying that is because every time someone joined the company at Front, I show the  video of Demo Day so I know my demo day pitch by heart, because I've  listened to it so many times and so part of the pitch is we've haven't  had a single user churn.

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我们没有一个用户流失-基本上，我之所以这么说，是因为每次有人在前线加入公司的时候，我都会播放演示日的视频，这样我就能记住我的演示日了，因为我已经听了很多次了，所以部分原因是我们从来没有一个用户流失过。

Geoff Ralston: And that's good, right?

Geoff Ralston: 那很好，对吧？

Mathilde Collin: Great. It doesn't mean though, so that's great but what wasn't great is our conversion  rate from trial to paid was terrible.

Mathilde Collin:太好了。这并不意味着，所以这是伟大的，但不太好的是，我们的转换率从审判到支付是可怕的。

Geoff Ralston: Why was that?

Geoff Ralston: 为什么？

Mathilde Collin: I mean, just because the product was very early, and so didn't have a lot  of the features that the market needed.

Mathilde Collin:我的意思是，仅仅是因为产品太早，所以没有市场所需要的很多功能。

Geoff Ralston: Have you managed to shift that over time?

Geoff Ralston: 随着时间的推移，你成功地改变了这一点吗？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, I mean, we've built more and more and so our conversion has increased.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我的意思是，我们建造了更多的建筑，所以我们的转换也增加了。

Geoff Ralston: I want to talk about how you went from hundreds to thousands of customers but  a question that's come up a lot during startup school is like, how do you  figure out how to price your product, can you talk about the Fronts pricing journey  from where you started to, how you started into where you are now?

Geoff Ralston: 我想谈谈你是如何从成百上千的顾客中走出来的，但是一个在创业学校里经常出现的问题是，你如何知道如何定价你的产品，你能谈谈从你开始到现在的价格征程吗？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so we started with a freemium model, so we had $3 or $9 per  user per month. One thing I would say is just release your pricing as early  as possible because there is ... So first, you're always scared that you're not ready,  but you're ready. All of you at least, the good thing is that will confront  you to the market and this which you need two is when you want to  listen to some feedback, you should listen to feedback of people that are paying some  money, because otherwise you can be over whelmed with feedback from people that will never  pay for your product so we had a freemium model, what we realized is even  if we had a free product, I think at the end, we maybe had 15%  of our users on the free plan. It was more a distraction. Like it's good  to have a free plan if that's a way for you to get leads and  then you convert these leads but if it's just something where you end up having  15% of your users is less useful, so we moved it changed it into 9  and 19 consistently increase prices over time. Maybe too much.

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我们从免费模式开始，所以我们每个用户每月有3到9美元。我想说的是尽快公布你的价格因为.所以首先，你总是害怕你没有准备好，但你已经准备好了。你们所有人-至少，好的是，你们会面对市场-你们需要两种，当你想听一些反馈的时候，你应该听取那些付钱的人的反馈，因为否则你会被那些永远不会为你的产品付费的人的反馈所吸引，所以我们有了一个免费的模型，我们意识到，即使我们有一个免费的产品，我认为在最后，我们可能有15%的用户在免费计划。更多的是分散注意力。就像有一个免费的计划，如果这是一种获得线索的方式，然后你转换这些线索，但如果它只是你的15%的用户是不太有用的东西，所以我们把它改为9和19不断提高价格随着时间的推移。也许太多了。

Geoff Ralston: Do you feel like you started too low?

Geoff Ralston: 你觉得你开始的时候太低了吗？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, and I think 99.99% of people will tell you that they started too low  so yeah. It doesn't matter, though, because you can increase price later.

Mathilde Collin:是的，我认为99.99%的人会告诉你，他们开始的时候太低了，所以是的。不过没关系，因为你以后可以涨价。

Geoff Ralston: It's harder to increase than to decrease, I suppose.

Geoff Ralston: 我想，增加比减少更难。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, true but everyone does it.

Mathilde Collin:没错，但每个人都这么做。

Geoff Ralston: How did you come up with those numbers? Was it sort of a 99.99?

Geoff Ralston: 你是怎么得出这些数字的？是不是99.99？

Mathilde Collin: 100%. Oh, yeah. You can work as ... So we're now for the first time-

Mathilde Collin:100%。哦，是的。你可以当.。所以我们现在是第一次-

Geoff Ralston: Did you ask customers what they would pay?

Geoff Ralston: 你有没有问顾客他们会付多少钱？

Mathilde Collin: No, I don't think they can tell you. Of course, you can look at your  competition and then make sure that you're on a 10 times cheaper or 10 times  more expensive but then once you know that and you have a range just pick  a number and go.

Mathilde Collin:不，我不认为他们能告诉你。当然，你可以看看你的竞争对手，然后确保你的价格便宜了10倍或者贵了10倍，但一旦你知道了，你就选择一个号码就行了。

Geoff Ralston: Just pick the number and go.

Geoff Ralston: 选个号码走吧。

Mathilde Collin: Like in the scope of destruction that you can have in the early days like  thinking too much about the pricing is one of them. Just pick a price and  sell the products and you'll see what people say.

马蒂尔德·科林：就像你在早期可以拥有的破坏范围，比如对定价考虑太多就是其中之一。只要选择一个价格并出售产品，你就会看到人们是怎么说的。

Geoff Ralston: I wanted to dig more into one other thing about sort of the initial stages  of growth and talking to customers. Is there any advice you would give? Because you  just gave a really useful piece of advice, which is to talk to people who  are paying more than people who aren't but what advice can you give to people  who are trying to extract useful feedback from customers?

Geoff Ralston: 我想深入了解另一件关于成长初期和与客户交谈的事情。你有什么建议吗？因为你刚刚给出了一个非常有用的建议，那就是和那些比不付更多钱的人交谈，但是你能给那些试图从顾客那里得到有用反馈的人什么建议呢？

Mathilde Collin: Yes. I think first of all, you should understand that not everyone wants to share  feedback in the same way and so for us, we had different ways to get  feedback so one of them was talking to people and so people that would accept  to talk to me, I would talk to them and they would tell me, “I  like this. I don't like that”. But another thing that we did was we were  using TrailO for product roadmap and so we published our TrailO roadmap and so even  today, if you go in Front.com/roadmap. You can see our roadmap.

Mathilde Collin:是的。我认为首先，你应该明白，并不是每个人都想以同样的方式分享反馈，所以对我们来说，我们有不同的方式获得反馈，其中一个是和人交谈，所以人们会接受和我交谈，我会和他们交谈，他们会告诉我，“我喜欢这个。我不喜欢这样“。但我们所做的另一件事是，我们使用TrailO作为产品路线图，因此我们发布了TrailO路线图，甚至在今天，如果您访问Front.com/路线图的话。你可以看到我们的路线图。

Geoff Ralston: Its public?

Geoff Ralston: 公众吗？

Mathilde Collin: It's public, it's always been public, I can talk about that, but you can vote  for the thing that you want and that's one of the way we got a  ton of feedback as well so I just felt like some people ... And then  another thing that we did was every quarter at the beginning of the quarter, I  would email all our customers and I would say, working on the roadmap for this  quarter, what do you want to see? And then they would replay. I think it  was a good mix of people that want to spend a lot of times people  that want to spend some time and people that just want to do one click,  but in any way, you need to have these data.

Mathilde Collin:这是公开的，它一直都是公开的，我可以说，但你可以投票给你想要的东西，这也是我们得到大量反馈的方式之一，所以我只是觉得有些人.然后我们做的另一件事是，在每季度开始的时候，我会发邮件给我们的所有客户，我会说，为这个季度制定路线图，你想看到什么？然后他们会重放。我认为这是一个很好的组合，人们想花很多时间-想花点时间的人和只想点击一下的人-但是无论如何，你都需要有这些数据。

Geoff Ralston: That sounds like it's a little bit later in your evolution. When you had TrailO  and you had a roadmap and the very beginning when you're trying to figure out,  you talk to Adora and figure out SMS what was that like? How did you  know if you're talking to a customer who is giving you useful feedback or basically  wasting your time?

Geoff Ralston: 听起来好像是在你进化的后期。当你有TrailO，你有一个路线图，当你试图弄清楚的时候，你和Adora交谈，找出短信是什么样的？你怎么知道你在和一个给你有用的反馈或者基本上是浪费你时间的顾客说话呢？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so I think once you talk to someone, you have to figure out if  you understand the person really well, because they can tell you I think I want  that and then you build it and that's not what they want so the best  way you can think about sales so I would bet that most of you are  not excited about doing a sales score. I mean, that's my guess and it's normal  because I otherwise would be doing sales in a company and that was how I  felt-

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我认为一旦你和某人交谈，你就必须弄清楚你是否很了解这个人，因为他们可以告诉你，我想要这个，然后你构建它，这不是他们想要的，所以你可以用最好的方式来看待销售，所以我敢打赌，你们中的大多数人都不会对做销售成绩感到兴奋。我是说，这是我的猜测，这很正常，因为否则我会在一家公司做销售，这就是我的感受-

Geoff Ralston: Like me.

Geoff Ralston: 和我一样。

Mathilde Collin: That's how I felt as well so one thing that I would say is the  way I thought about sales in the early days was I wanted to make sure  I understood exactly where the workflows of people were, what their issue was, and then  think afterwards confront, solve it and I think that then it becomes pretty interesting so  today when I do sales score or sales meeting or customer success meeting, like I'm  not here to sell extra feature or to demo the product like I find that  a bit boring but what I'm here to do is understand exactly what their pinpoint  is and what their workflow is and then can I explain to them how that  could be better with Front. If it can be better with Front and so I  guess they're key things that you need to focus on one is being incredibly honest  with yourself about whether Front is a good solution for them. Even today, one of  the thing that I struggle the most with is telling our team, these are some  use cases we want and these are some use cases we don't want and being  very deliberate about saying yes and no, in the early days is insanely important and  you know that the truth is, you know where you want this company to be,  and you don't know 100% but at least you can tell if that's something you  want, or that's something don't want, and then making sure that you are super curious  when you were doing the sale scores and making sure that he was more about  understanding something that someone is telling you more than demoing the product or showing a  list of features they probably don't care that much about.

Mathilde Collin:我也是这么想的，所以我要说的是，我在早期对销售的看法是，我想要确保我能准确地理解人们的工作流程，他们的问题是什么，然后再想一想，解决这个问题，然后我认为它变得非常有趣，所以今天当我做销售分数，销售会议或客户成功会议，就像我来这里不是为了销售额外的功能或者演示这个产品，就像我觉得这有点无聊，但我在这里要做的是确切地了解他们的定位以及他们的工作流程，然后我能向他们解释一下，用Front如何才能更好。如果它可以更好，所以我想，他们是关键的事情，你需要集中精力，其中之一是对自己保持难以置信的诚实，对他们来说，前线是否是一个好的解决方案。即使在今天，我最纠结的事情之一就是告诉我们的团队，这些是我们想要的用例，这些用例是我们不想要的，并且非常慎重地说“是”和“不”，在早期的日子里是非常重要的，你知道事实是，你知道你想让这家公司在哪里，你不知道100%，但至少你能知道这是你想要的东西，还是不想要的东西，然后确保你在做销售分数时是超级好奇，并确保他更多地理解别人告诉你的事情，而不是演示产品或展示他们可能不太关心的功能清单。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, so I want to come back to that because it seems to harken back  to your idea of discipline. Basically, you're saying you have to say no to some  customers because if you want to keep your churn down to zero and you sell  the wrong person, the wrong product, you're going to have churn.

Geoff Ralston: 是的，所以我想回到这个问题上来，因为它似乎又回到了你对纪律的看法上。基本上，你说你必须对一些客户说不，因为如果你想把你的消费额降到零，你卖错了人，卖错了产品，你就会流失。

Mathilde Collin: I think the churn is not the biggest danger. I think the biggest danger is  you have a customer and then you care so much about growing your revenues so  then they're telling you, I want this and so then you build this and I  want that and you build that and then you just you push your product in  a direction that you don't want to go and I think that's the biggest mistake.

Mathilde Collin:我认为搅乱并不是最大的危险。我认为最大的危险是你有一个客户，然后你非常关心你的收入增长，然后他们告诉你，我想要这个，然后你制造这个，然后你把你的产品推向一个你不想去的方向，我认为这是最大的错误。

Geoff Ralston: Let's talk a little bit about sales because you've had to learn about enterprise sales  all on your own and you've had to build a Salesforce talk a little bit  about what that's been like and what advice you would give to people who are  probably just a couple of folks trying to figure out how to get their product  into customers hands.

Geoff Ralston: 让我们谈一谈销售，因为你必须自己学习企业销售，你还得建立一个Salesforce的演讲，讨论一下这是什么样子，以及你会给那些可能只是几个人的人提供什么样的建议，试图弄清楚如何把他们的产品交给客户。

Mathilde Collin: I guess my advice based on a mistake I did was first you need to  figure out ...
There are different sales missions you can have so for example you  can have a bottom up approach or a top down approach so top down you  sell to CIO and then they debate product, bottom up is you demo the product  to the end user and because they tell you that it's going to be a  great tool, then that's how they will buy and I think that we try to  do both and we struggled a lot and first of all, I think you should  know how you want to sell your product because the people you will hire, the  way you will sell your product, everything will be different if your bottom up or  top down. Piece of advice number one. Now, I can tell you that we started  bottom up so we had a lot of customers and it was a numbers game  so the only thing that I cared about was, our reps should call every lead  five times and should end up having 15 demos every week and I don't care  about how they make it happen but I want to see that level of activity  and so every morning we would receive an email saying here are all the calls  that have been done and here are all the meetings that have been scheduled and  that have been done and I think that the input is far more important at  this stage than the output because the truth is if they don't hit their target  first, your target could be wrong and how could you know what your target should  be? When you're so early and two maybe your product is an issue, or maybe  your pricing is an issue, you don't know that. I've always felt like, if you  look at the end number, it's actually pretty challenging and you might blame someone for  not doing a good job whereas they're doing a really good job. Whereas if you  look at just number of demos and calls they make, and if you check that  they're not saying stupid things, then they're pretty doing a good job and you should  be happy and learn from that.

Mathilde Collin:我想我的建议是基于我犯的一个错误，首先你需要弄清楚.你可以有不同的销售任务，例如，你可以有自下而上的方法或者自上而下的方法，这样你就可以把产品卖给CIO，然后他们会讨论产品，自下而上就是把产品演示给最终用户，因为他们告诉你这是一个很好的工具，这就是他们的购买方式-我认为我们试图做到这两种方式-我们为此付出了很大的努力。首先，我认为你应该知道你想如何销售你的产品，因为你要雇佣的人，销售你的产品的方式，如果你自下而上或自上而下的话，一切都会不同。第一条建议。现在，我可以告诉你，我们开始自下而上，所以我们有很多客户，这是一个数字游戏，所以我唯一关心的是，我们的代表应该给每条线索打5次电话，每周都要做15次演示，我不关心它们是如何实现的，但我想看到这种程度的活动，所以每天早上我们都会收到一封电子邮件，上面写着已经做过的所有电话，还有所有已经安排好的会议。我认为在这个阶段输入比输出要重要得多，因为事实是如果他们没有先达到目标，你的目标可能是错的，你怎么知道你的目标应该是什么？当你这么早的时候，你的产品可能是一个问题，或者你的价格是一个问题，你不知道。我一直觉得，如果你看最后的数字，这实际上是相当有挑战性的，你可能会指责某人做得不好，而他们却做得很好。然而，如果你看看他们做的演示和电话，如果你检查他们不是在说蠢话，那么他们做得很好，你应该高兴并从中吸取教训。

Geoff Ralston: You said something to me the other day about one of the key lessons you  learned and you were referring to it earlier about the importance of listening versus describing  your product.

Geoff Ralston: 前几天你对我说了一些关于你学到的关键经验教训的话，你之前提到了倾听和描述产品的重要性。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, so I think the tendency like you're all super ... Either you're ashamed or  whatever, you want to show your product and I think that's the temptation and every  person I talked to that starting their new company wants to show me the product.  The truth is resist this temptation. First try to ask me questions, because then it's  too late. Like when you've matured your product, that's the moment you can ask so  much, because people want to see what's new so they will answer a few questions  and I believe that you should spend a lot of time listening to this, understanding  and then showing maybe 10% of your features, and it doesn't matter but not doing  like if I do the full demo of Front you'll be pretty bored. Now, if  I explain to you how when I was in your seat using Front, I think  is one of the thing that made us successful as the company then and I'm  convinced and I'm obviously super biased, but I'm convinced then maybe you will be more  interested to hear.

Mathilde Collin:是的，所以我认为你们的倾向是超级.无论你感到羞耻还是什么，你都想展示你的产品，我认为这就是诱惑，我和每个刚开始新公司的人都想向我展示产品。事实就是抵制这种诱惑。先问我几个问题，因为现在太晚了。就像当你的产品成熟的时候，你可以要求很多，因为人们想知道什么是新的，所以他们会回答一些问题，我认为你应该花很多时间听这个，理解，然后展示你的10%的功能，这不重要，但不像我做的全部演示的前沿，你会很无聊。现在，如果我向你解释一下，当我坐在你的位子上的时候，我认为这是让我们成为公司成功的原因之一，我确信，我很明显是有偏见的，但我相信，也许你会更感兴趣地听到。

Geoff Ralston: I'm going to transition a little bit before we go to QA. I have a  feeling that you're fundraising experience was maybe-

Geoff Ralston: 在我们去QA之前，我要先转换一下。我觉得你的筹款经历也许-

Mathilde Collin: Unusual.

Mathilde Collin:不寻常。

Geoff Ralston: Not representative, maybe a little bit too simple, but maybe I'm wrong about that. Were  there any lessons from fundraising that you think are useful besides grow really fast and  have a cool company? Because that helps?

Geoff Ralston: 不是代表，也许有点简单，但也许我错了。除了快速成长和拥有一家很酷的公司之外，你认为还有什么关于募捐的经验教训吗？因为这有帮助吗？

Mathilde Collin: Right, yes, it's unusual. Every time we've raised we've raised ... I think, if I  think about why though, so I think it's unusual and that's not what you should  expect. Now the thing that we did Well again, coming back to discipline, I've published  all my seed series, a series B deck, they are online so you can look  at them and you'll see that our metrics are pretty good and it's just like  every single day, every single week, and every single month, I care about hitting our  targets, and they will do everything it takes for us to hit our targets and  that's what's shown in this metrics and at the end of the day, even if  of course, people were excited about the team we had the market opportunity and whatever  like to ask them why are they crazy about Front it's because of our metrics.  I just feel like-

Mathilde Collin:对，是的，这很不寻常。每次我们提出.。我认为，如果我考虑为什么，所以我认为这是不寻常的，这不是你应该期待的。现在我们又做得很好，回到纪律，我出版了我所有的种子系列，B系列，它们都在网上，这样你就可以看到我们的指标是非常好的，就像每一天，每一周，每一个月，我关心的是实现我们的目标，他们会尽一切努力来达到我们的目标-这就是我们的指标所显示的-最终，即使人们对我们有市场机会的团队感到兴奋，不管是什么，他们问他们为什么对Front着迷-这是因为我们的指标-这是因为我们的衡量标准。我只是觉得-

Geoff Ralston: So grow, have good metrics, have a good product.

Geoff Ralston: 所以成长，有好的指标，有好的产品。

Mathilde Collin: You can't imagine like, even if it seems obvious, the two things I've seen that  I know are wrong from founders. One is coming up with excuses. For example, I'm  helping you as a company and you tell me, “I want our revenue to grow”.  And then the week after we meet today, I'm like, “What's your revenue?” You're like,  “I'm not focusing on that because we had to redo our homepage because the conversion  blah, blah, blah”. I don't care about your conversion.
The only thing I care about  is that I think you've convinced yourself that your website was more important, and that's  something that I see all the time just finding excuses for not growing and I  understand how hard it is to admit that you're not growing and that's an issue  and you need to fix it but if you don't admit it to yourself and  your team then you will not grow that's for sure. One-

马蒂尔德·科林：你无法想象，即使看起来很明显，我所看到的两件事，我从创始人那里看到的都是错误的。一个是找借口。例如，作为一家公司，我正在帮助你，你告诉我，“我希望我们的收入增长”。然后在我们今天见面的那一周，我会说，“你的收入是多少？”你会说，“我没有专注于这个，因为我们不得不重新做我们的主页，因为转换之类的。”我不在乎你的转变。我唯一关心的是你让自己相信你的网站更重要，我一直在寻找不成长的借口，我明白承认自己没有成长是多么困难，这是一个问题，你需要解决这个问题，但是如果你自己和你的团队不承认这一点，那么你就不会成长，这是肯定的。一-

Geoff Ralston: The ultimate founder delusion.

Geoff Ralston: 最终的创始人错觉。

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, and two is then bring discipline to force you to face the reality and  one way is to send this weekly email to your team, monthly email to your  investors. I've invested in a few companies in the past few years and you can't  imagine how I can tell you after two or three emails so two or three  months which companies are going to be successful, and now if I'm the only one  to have that opinion or that insight but I just feel like there are people  that will send an email and then nothing for four months and then email and  then blah blah or some people, that will change the format every single month and  some people that are incredibly disciplined about here are our KPIs and I will send  it to you every month and that's also what I show my team and that's  how we have focus, so important.

马蒂尔德·科林：是的，第二种方法是遵守纪律，迫使你面对现实，其中一种方法是每周给你的团队发一封电子邮件，每月给你的投资者发一封电子邮件。在过去的几年里，我投资了几家公司，你无法想象，在两三封电子邮件之后，我怎么能告诉你，哪些公司会成功，现在，如果我是唯一一个有这种观点或洞察力的人，但我只是觉得有些人会发一封电子邮件，然后四个月内什么都不发，然后发邮件，然后是其他人，这将改变每一个月的格式，有些人对此非常严格，这是我们的KPI，我每个月都会发送给你们，这也是我向我的团队展示的，这也是我们集中精力的方式，非常重要。

Geoff Ralston: That's a great lesson so last thing I want to talk about was, your co  founder recently got sick and it caused the company to have to do a whole  bunch of things and maybe change you to sort of re look at your priorities  and what was important to you as a person as a CEO, as a friend,  as a co founder and as just a human being in the company. Maybe you  can talk a little bit about what that experience has been like.

Geoff Ralston: 这是一个很好的教训，所以我最后想说的是，你的联合创始人最近生病了，导致公司不得不做一大堆事情，也许会改变你，让你重新审视你的优先事项，以及作为一个CEO，作为朋友对你来说什么是重要的。作为公司的联合创始人和个人。也许你可以谈谈这段经历是什么样的。

Mathilde Collin: Sure. So December 2016, so year and a half ago, my co founder was diagnosed  with cancer and it was pretty bad and now he's fine so he took 18  months and I think the thing that they realized that they would ... Well, you're  here and you're listening to how to build a company every single day you're working  on your company, it's so important, but you should remember that the most important thing  is to be happy and healthy and as much as you care about these companies  it's just a job and it's annoying to have to go through these painful moments  to realize it but one thing that I do now is anytime ... So there  are many things that I've changed personally and for the company, but at least anytime  someone joined the company, I go through a presentation, and a share like, what is  Front. What I care about, and I will always tell them like, first and foremost,  be happy and healthy and if Front is not a place where you can be  and be happy and healthy. You shouldn't be here and Front is important but life  is far more important, and I think them knowing that that's how you think is  insanely important so just tell other people, you love that you love them and spend  time with your friends and go on vacation and all these things are equally important  or more important than pricing your product in the right way and doing all these  phone calls, etcetera.
That's just what I've been asked to talk about.
The other thing  is one thing that changed my life is meditation, and I'm also convinced that it  will change the life of probably 95% of human beings, so before I felt like  I had a choice between caring so much about my company and so therefore being  unhappy because if you care so much, even if your company is doing okay, there  are so many things to worry about. I cared so much I was constantly upsets  like, “I'm worried this customer is churning and worried this person is not working out,  I'm worried, I don't know how we'll hit our goals for next month” Or then  sometimes I tried to care less but then the company wasn't doing as well, so  I was like either I care, and I'm unhappy, or I don't care, and I'm  unhappy because the company is not doing well, so I'm doomed. I think meditation was  really good because I meditate 10 minutes every morning I wake up have a shower  meditate for 10 minutes using headspace, and it's really something that doesn't have immediate benefits  so if you're waiting ... Like, I don't feel better after I've meditated, you have  to think about it is a muscle that you're training and what it does is  really what it says, which is headspace so it's like I could tell you if  you want how things are going at Front right now.
There are so many things  need to be figured out and the truth is, I feel great. It's like, I  know that I have a bunch of things to figure out and I know that  either I'm working on them or someone else who's working on them. I care so  much but I have this headspace to not be overwhelmed by everything bad that's happening  and that's by far has been the thing that had the biggest impact in my  life and I think my co founder, being sick is what led me to me  being overwhelmed to the point where I was not sure that they could still run  Front and so I had to act and meditation was one other thing I did.

Mathilde Collin:当然。所以2016年12月，也就是一年半前，我的联合创始人被诊断出患了癌症，现在病情很严重，所以他花了18个月的时间，我想他们意识到他们会.好吧，你在这里，你每天都在听着如何在你的公司工作，这很重要，但你应该记住，最重要的是快乐和健康，尽管你很关心这些公司，但这只是一份工作，要经历这些痛苦的时刻才能意识到这一点是很烦人的，但我现在做的一件事是随时…因此，我个人和公司都有很多改变，但至少在任何时候，当有人加入公司时，我都要做一次演示，并分享一下，比如“什么是前沿”。我关心的，我会告诉他们，首先，要快乐和健康，如果前线不是一个地方，你可以和快乐和健康。你不应该在这里，前线是重要的，但生命更重要，我想他们知道你认为这是非常重要的，所以告诉其他人，你爱他们，花时间和朋友在一起度假，所有这些事情都是同样重要或更重要的，比你的产品定价正确的方式和做所有这些电话，等等。这正是我被要求谈论的。还有一件事改变了我的生活，那就是冥想，我也相信冥想会改变大约95%的人的生活，所以在我觉得我可以在关心我的公司和不开心之间做出选择之前，因为如果你那么在乎，即使你的公司做得很好，有很多事情要担心。我太在意了，我总是心烦意乱地说，“我担心这个顾客在翻腾，担心这个人不工作，我担心，我不知道我们下个月会如何实现我们的目标”，或者有时候我不太在意，但后来公司就没那么好了，所以我要么在乎，要么不在乎，我不开心，因为公司做得不好，所以我注定要死。我认为冥想真的很好，因为我每天早上冥想10分钟，每天早上醒来，用头空间洗澡冥想10分钟，而且它真的没有即时的好处，所以如果你在等待.就像，我打坐后感觉不太好，你必须考虑这是你正在训练的肌肉，它所做的实际上是它所说的，也就是它的头部空间，所以我可以告诉你，如果你想现在前线的情况如何。有那么多的事情需要解决，而事实是，我感觉很好。就像，我知道我有很多事情要解决，我知道要么我在研究它们，要么有人在研究它们。我非常在乎，但我有这样的空间，不要被正在发生的所有糟糕的事情所淹没，这是迄今为止对我生命中影响最大的事情，我想我的共同创始人，生病是导致我不知所措的原因，以至于我不确定他们是否还能跑到前线，所以我不得不采取行动，冥想是我做的另一件事。

Geoff Ralston: Try not to wait until you have something that awful happened in your life or  someone you love or someone you're close to his life. We're going to spend more  time on the topic of how to stay human being while you're doing a startup  tomorrow when Daniel Ross comes in to give a talk. But with that, let's go  to Q&A for a while, yeah.

Geoff Ralston: 不要等到你的生活中发生了一些可怕的事情，或者你爱的人，或者你与他的生活关系密切的人。当丹尼尔·罗斯(DanielRoss)来做演讲时，我们将花更多的时间在如何保持人性这个话题上，而你明天正在创业。但有了这个，让我们再问一会吧，是的。

Mathilde Collin: I'm gonna ask the same question again about enterprise how you take care of the  security and privacy part of setting it to the enterprise and I understand that you  want enterprise customer not to feel desperate about it but like well you're actually at  a point where you are dealing with that. What is the best [inaudible]

Mathilde Collin:我要再问一个关于企业的问题，你是如何处理企业安全和隐私的？我明白，你希望企业客户不要对此感到绝望，但就好像你在处理这个问题一样。什么是最好的[听不见的]？

Geoff Ralston: The question is around dealing with safety and security when you're trying to sell to  enterprise customers and how soon can you get it in their hands I think things  like that.

Geoff Ralston: 问题是，当你试图向企业客户销售产品时，你要如何处理安全和保障问题，你多久才能把它掌握在他们的手中，我想是这样的事情。

Mathilde Collin: Yes and so even if we didn't start as an enterprise sales we are dealing  with emails so security was a big deal so what I would say is it's  never enough the thing is you have to find the companies that are willing to  take more risks because you have no choice like for us of course everyone wanted  us to be set to compliant and stuff we're still not compliant today but what  we did, we did a lot of things from just a one pager that explain  everything about why our businesses secure two very early on, Tesla started using our product  and they wanted to make sure that they were using it for product feedback and  they were, they wanted to make sure that their information was secure and so we  did a few penetration tests like that doesn't cost a lot of money.
Then if  you can say, “Okay, we had good results, and you can show the results to  other companies”.
Then at least it unlocks some potential but the truth is, you also  needed to agree to not go after a few industries or just not go after  a few customers because they always want more, but there are companies that will accept  to have their emails deal with companies that's three months old, knows nothing about anything  and they will because there are a few things that you can show them.

Mathilde Collin:是的，即使我们不是从企业销售开始，我们处理的是电子邮件，所以安全是一件大事，所以我要说的是，永远都不够，问题是你必须找到那些愿意承担更多风险的公司，因为你别无选择，当然，每个人都希望我们成为这样的公司。我们现在还没有遵守，但是我们所做的，我们用一个传呼机做了很多事情，它解释了为什么我们的企业很早就有了两个，特斯拉开始使用我们的产品，他们想确保他们使用它作为产品反馈，他们想确保他们的信息是安全的，所以我们做了一些这样的渗透测试，这样的测试不需要花很多钱。然后，如果你可以说，“好的，我们有很好的结果，你可以向其他公司展示结果”。那么，至少它释放了一些潜力，但事实是，你也需要同意不去追求几个行业，或者只是不去追求一些客户，因为他们总是想要更多，但有些公司会接受让他们的电子邮件处理的公司已经有三个月了，什么都不知道，他们会知道的，因为你可以向他们展示一些东西。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. You got the same answer twice. So hopefully that helps. Yes.
Speaker 3: How did you define [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: 好的。你得到了同样的答案两次。希望这能帮上忙。是演讲者3：你是怎么定义[听不见的]的？

Geoff Ralston: Why in the end did you choose a subscription based model?

Geoff Ralston: 为什么你最终选择了一种基于订阅的模式？

Mathilde Collin: I believe that people get more benefit out of the product when they have more  users so that's the reason why I also think that most of our most of  the competition, so whether you're looking at Health Solutions or email products, they charge per  user per month, or per user per year so the combination of everyone does it.  Plus, it seems in line with the benefit that people get is what led us  to have a subscription model?

Mathilde Collin:我相信，当用户越多，人们就能从产品中获得更多的好处。所以我也认为，我们大部分的竞争对手都是如此，所以不管你是在看健康解决方案还是电子邮件产品，他们每个用户每月收费，或者每年向每个用户收费，所以每个人都能做到这一点。此外，它似乎符合人们得到的好处是什么导致我们有一个订阅模式？

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 4: What's the best way to notify your users you're going to raise the price?

Geoff Ralston: 是的。扬声器4：什么是最好的方式通知你的用户，你要提高价格？

Geoff Ralston: What's the best way to notify your users you're going to raise price?

Geoff Ralston: 告诉你的用户你要提价的最好方式是什么？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, it's a good question. I was chatting with the president of the Federation about  that and he gave me some good advice which is the temptation is to say,  we're going to raise our price but will do that maybe and so you want  to be nice and so you give a lot of time.
The problem is you  actually make your customers angry twice because by then they had forgotten and so then  bam! Again, it's almost as if you increased twice. Ones they get used ... So  just tell them and then do it sooner than later.
There is no good way  to do it. One more trick that we've used that I think is successful is  for us we have monthly subscription and already subscription and so you can tell them  that if they switched to a yearly plan, they will lock their price for one  more year, which is win win.
They pay less you have the money upfront so  at least that's one way to show that you care about them.

Mathilde Collin:是的，这是个好问题。我和联合会主席聊过这件事，他给了我一些很好的建议，那就是，我们会提高价格，但也许会这样做，所以你想要和善，所以你花了很多时间。问题是，你实际上让你的客户生气了两次，因为那时他们已经忘记了，然后砰！再一次，就好像你增加了两倍。它们会被利用.。所以告诉他们，然后尽快做。没有什么好办法来做这件事。我们使用的另一个技巧，我认为是成功的，对我们来说，我们每月订阅，已经订阅，所以你可以告诉他们，如果他们切换到一个年度计划，他们将锁定他们的价格再一年，这就是胜利。他们付的钱更少，所以至少这是你关心他们的一种方式。

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 5: [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: 是的。演讲者5：[听不见]

Mathilde Collin: Randomly-

Mathilde Collin:随机-

Geoff Ralston: How do you set the target for the first salesperson you hire?

Geoff Ralston: 你是如何为你雇佣的第一位销售人员设定目标的？

Mathilde Collin: Randomly? The truth is, I didn't know because I was the only one doing the  job so there are few ratio you can hear of so, for example they should  bring between three X and six X the amount of money they're paid so then  you have the range because the truth if they bring less than what they're paid  probably not good. 10 X probably not good either like you should hire more so  once you have that then building trust with your first rep saying, “That's what I  will inquire again I have no idea if it's the right thing but let's reassess  every month”. And then let's be realistic about what's feasible or not.

马蒂尔德·科林：随机？事实是，我不知道，因为我是唯一一个做这份工作的人，所以你所能听到的比率很少。例如，他们应该给他们带来3倍到6倍的报酬10 X可能也不太好，因为你应该雇佣更多的人，所以一旦你有了，然后和你的第一位代表建立信任，我会再问一遍，我不知道这是不是正确的事情，但让我们每个月重新评估一下。然后，让我们实事求是地看待什么是可行的，什么是不可行的。

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 6: [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: 是的。演讲者6：[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: Oh, this is a hard question so if users bounce How can you find them?

Geoff Ralston: 哦，这是一个很难回答的问题，如果用户反弹，你怎么能找到他们？

Mathilde Collin: Yeah, there are a few technologies that you can use Clearbit is one of them,  but for us I care more about the people that sign up never converting because  they showed interest the truth is I think our conversion rate on our website is  maybe 3% so there are so much and we don't know about them so we  don't do much about them.

Mathilde Collin:是的，有几种技术你可以使用Clearbit就是其中之一，但对于我们来说，我更关心那些注册的人，因为他们表现出了兴趣。事实上，我认为我们在网站上的转化率可能是3%，所以我们不了解他们，所以我们对他们不做什么。

Geoff Ralston: Wiki follows at the top are difficult, yes.
Speaker 7: When you talk about starting [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Wiki在顶端的表现很难，是的。演讲者7：当你谈论开始[听不见]时

Geoff Ralston: How early should you put pricing out there and be transparent about it even while  you're still in beta?

Geoff Ralston: 在你还在测试版的时候，你应该在多早的时候就把定价放出来，并对它保持透明呢？

Mathilde Collin: It's a good question one thing I did that I think was a great idea  was so implementing Stripe for us took some time but I wanted to know if  people were willing to pay for the product before we had Stripe implemented so in  private beta when you sign up to Front you would receive an automated email from  me saying what would you give me to get access to our product and so  the so I like LEGOs and that was my Twitter feed and so some people  would send me a LEGOs sets or like when our first customer is a company  called Lumio, they do lamp and so they said, “We'll give you a lamp”. I  guess I was just very creative into trying to understand what people were willing to  give and if it's not money doesn't matter.
The truth is even giving an hour  of the time you ask them, you can have access, if you spend 30 minutes  an hour with me is a proof that they will accept to give something.

Mathilde Collin:我做了一件很好的事情，我认为这是个好主意，所以为我们实现Stripe需要一些时间，但我想知道在我们让Stripe在私下测试中实现之前，人们是否愿意为这个产品付费，当您注册了Front时，您会收到我的一封自动邮件，上面写着您会怎么做？让我访问我们的产品，所以我喜欢LEGO，这是我的Twitter提要，所以有些人会给我发送一个LEGO集，或者像我们的第一个客户是Lumio公司一样，他们做灯，所以他们说，“我们会给你一盏灯”。我想我只是很有创意地试着去了解人们愿意付出什么，如果不是钱，那就无所谓了。事实是，你问他们的时间甚至是一个小时，你可以进入，如果你每小时花30分钟和我在一起，那就是他们会接受给予一些东西的证据。

Geoff Ralston: In the back.
Speaker 8: How did you get the first 3000 signups for private beta?

Geoff Ralston: 在后面。演讲者8：你是如何获得第一批3000名私人测试版注册的？

Geoff Ralston: How did you get those first 3000 signups for private beta?

Geoff Ralston: 你是怎么得到私人测试版的第一批3000名注册的？

Mathilde Collin: It was only content marketing. I was doing an email product and I was writing  all these blog posts about his email did as Slack is saying, or like all  things that I think people were curious to hear about or what will email look  like 20 years from now and content Marketing was or then I was YC and  I was writing a something about what it's like to be at YC a month  in and then another one what it's like to be in YC three months in  and people get reading them and so content marketing has been big for us I  think it's good in the early days I don't know if it's scales as much  I don't think it does but that's how we got our signups.

Mathilde Collin:这只是内容营销。我在做一个电子邮件产品，我写了所有关于他的邮件的博客文章，就像斯拉克说的，或者，就像所有我认为人们很想听到的事情，或者20年后电子邮件看起来会是什么样子，内容市场营销(Content市场部)，或者当时我是YC，我写了一个关于一个月后在YC的感觉，然后又写了一个在YC三个月之后，人们得到了什么感觉。阅读它们，所以内容营销对我们来说是很大的，我认为在早期它是好的，我不知道它的规模，我不认为它有，但这是我们的注册方式。

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 9: You talked about putting on more features based on what you hear from customers [inaudible]  set pricing, I understand that and then they ask for more features. How did you  adjust your pricing after that?

Geoff Ralston: 是的。演讲者9：你说要根据你从客户那里听到的(听不见的)设定价格来增加功能，我理解，然后他们要求更多的功能。在那之后，你是如何调整你的价格的？

Geoff Ralston: How do you adjust pricing in the context of feature demands or new product demands  from customers?

Geoff Ralston: 你是如何根据客户的特点需求或新产品需求来调整定价的？

Mathilde Collin: The truth is new features are always a great way to upsell and so usually  with like I was very happy to build a new feature and put it in  a new plan and say like you can have a 30 day trial of these  feature but then would you be done to double the price per user you're using  that feature. Also, something that we did two years ago, and I wrote a blog  post about this is, we built a backend system that enables us to iterate super  quickly on our pricing so if tomorrow I want to change one of our enterprise  feature and put it in the premium plan, I can easily do it and I  can just reduce the new pricing doesn't generate anything for existing users so that's a  good way to just look at your cohorts and see where does every feature fit  best.

马蒂尔德·科林：事实是，新功能总是一个很好的推销方式，所以通常我非常乐意构建一个新功能，并将它放入一个新的计划中，比如你可以对这些功能进行30天的试用，但这样你会不会把你使用该功能的每个用户的价格翻一番。另外，我们两年前做的一些事情，我在博客上写了一篇关于这个的文章，我们建立了一个后端系统，使我们能够在我们的定价上快速迭代，所以如果明天我想改变我们的企业特性，并把它放在溢价计划中，我可以轻松地做到这一点，而且我可以降低新的定价，不会为现有用户产生任何东西，所以这是一个很好的方法，只需查看您的队列，看看哪里的每个功能最适合。

Geoff Ralston: We're going to do one more question right here.
Speaker 10: You said you quit your job because you wanted to work in email how did  you figure out exactly what product to build?

Geoff Ralston: 我们现在再问一个问题。演讲者10：你说你辞职是因为你想在电子邮件里工作，你是怎么搞清楚要生产什么产品的？

Geoff Ralston: The question is, you quit your job because you wanted to work in email, but  how did you figure out what product to build?

Geoff Ralston: 问题是，你辞职是因为你想在电子邮件中工作，但是你是怎么知道要生产什么样的产品的呢？

Mathilde Collin: I think email is a big problem to solve and so we had to make  sure that we had the right good to market, which was shared email addresses as  a way to enter this market.
The reason is, it was an easier product to  build, people were willing to pay for it and you could have a lightweight deployment  within an organization so not the entire company needs to use Front.
The reason I  chose that is I had a pin point when I was at this company. I  remember that we had all these support@sales@ addresses and people kept asking me, “Did you  reply to this email?” I was like, “Yes. Do you want me to cc you  on every single email?” “No” “So just believe me that I replied to this email”.  And that's a pin point that I had seen and so I thought it was  a good entry.

Mathilde Collin:我认为电子邮件是一个需要解决的大问题，所以我们必须确保我们对市场有正确的认识，这是共享的电子邮件地址，作为进入这个市场的一种方式。原因是，这是一个更容易构建的产品，人们愿意为此付费，而且您可以在一个组织中进行轻量级部署，而不是整个公司都需要使用Front。我之所以选择这样做，是因为我在这家公司工作的时候就有了自己的观点。我记得我们有这么多的支持“销售”地址，人们一直问我，“你回复这封邮件了吗？”我说，“是的。你想让我在每封电子邮件上给你发邮件吗？““不”所以相信我，我回复了这封邮件“。这是我见过的一个插脚点，所以我认为这是一个很好的入口。

Geoff Ralston: Awesome.
Thank you Mathilde.

Geoff Ralston: 太棒了。谢谢玛蒂尔德。

Mathilde Collin: Thank you so much.


Mathilde Collin:非常感谢。
