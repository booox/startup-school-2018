# Gustaf Alstromer - How to Get Users and Gro.


Geoff Ralston: On company updates.

杰夫·拉斯顿：关于公司进展。

Please be honest.

请诚实一点。

They're for you and not for us.

它们是给你的而不是给我们的。

If you  make them clearly crazy like, "We're never ever launching.

如果你让他们疯狂的话，“我们从来没有发射过。

We're launching in four million years,"  we'll get the hint.

我们将在四百万年后发射，“我们会得到提示的。

So don't do that.

所以别那么做。

There have been a lot of questions  about the graduation requirement, which was that you had to submit 9 out of 10  weekly updates.

有很多关于毕业要求的问题，那就是你必须提交每周10次更新中的9份。

This course was originally a 10-week course, and things changed around a little  bit.

这门课程最初是一个为期10周的课程，后来发生了一些变化。

It's actually more of a 9-week course now, and so it was a little  bit difficult for some groups to get going because of our little snafu in the  beginning of the course.

这实际上是一个为期9周的课程，所以对于一些团体来说，这是有点困难的，因为我们在课程开始的时候有一些小问题。

Here's the deal.

交易是这样的。

Eight out of nine updates is just fine.

九个更新中有八个是可以的。

But we're also going to extend the class, actually really two weeks beyond the lecture,  so that there will be plenty of time to do 10 updates, if you so  choose, and you choose to do nine out of 10, but eight out of nine  will be the absolute requirement for consideration for the $10,000 grant.

但我们也要延长课程的时间，实际上是在讲座结束后两周，这样如果你愿意的话，就有足够的时间进行10次更新，你选择了10次中的9次，但9次中的8次将是10，000美元的绝对需要考虑的条件。

We'll be flexible, but  make them good updates, make them real updates.

我们会很灵活，但让他们做好的更新，使他们真正的更新。

Another reminder.

又一次提醒。

Those weekly updates are due  11:59 p.m.

每周更新的时间是晚上11点59分。

Every Sunday, Pacific Standard Time.

每周日太平洋标准时间。

There's been some confusion about that, and we've  written it a number of times, but please recall when that is.

这方面有些混乱，我们已经写了很多次了，但请回忆一下是什么时候写的。

Questions, again, about  anything, about your moderators, about your groups, about your updates, please send to Startup School  at Ycombinator.com.

再次，关于任何问题，关于您的主持人，关于您的小组，关于您的更新，请发送到创业学校在联合网站。

My very last note is a reminder to launch if you haven't already.

我最后的笔记是一个提醒，如果你还没有启动。

 The only way to find out if you've made something that people would really want  is to have people really use it, so get your products out there, if you  haven't.

找出你是否做了人们真正想要的东西的唯一方法是让人们真正使用它，所以如果你没有，那么就把你的产品拿出来。

Now, I'm going to introduce our first speaker who is my esteemed partner at  Y Combinator, Gustaf Alströmer, who in 2012 was part of the group that built the  growth team at Airbnb.

现在，我要向大家介绍我们的第一位演讲者，他是Y Combinator公司尊敬的合伙人Gustaf Alstr mer，他在2012年加入了Airbnb的增长团队。

If you know anything about Airbnb, you know from 2012 for  the next five years, they grew an enormous amount.

如果你对Airbnb有任何了解，你就会知道，从2012年开始，在接下来的五年里，Airbnb的数量增长了很多。

This is something that Gustaf knows  better or at least as good as anyone in the entire world, so I'm thrilled  to have him talk today about growth.

这是古斯塔夫所知道的，或者至少和世界上任何一个人一样好，所以我很高兴他今天能谈论成长。

Gustaf A.: Thank you very much.

古斯塔夫：非常感谢。

Before I begin, thank you so much to Steven, Geoff, Adora,  Bill for putting all this together, so we can be here and do this today.

在我开始之前，非常感谢史蒂文，杰夫，阿多拉，比尔把所有这些都放在一起，这样我们今天就可以在这里做这件事了。

 I'm going to stalk about growth.

我要追踪关于成长的问题。

My background before joining YC last summer was being  one of the first person on the growth team at Airbnb and then growing that  team from, I think we were three people in the beginning.

在去年夏天加入YC之前，我的背景是成为Airbnb增长团队的第一批成员之一，然后在这个团队中成长，我想我们一开始是三个人。

This is how many  people were in 2015.

这就是2015年的人数。

We then grew to 100 and 120 people or something like  that.

然后我们增长到100人和120人或类似的东西。

Almost everything I'm talking about today here, I owe this group.

我今天在这里说的几乎所有的事情，我都欠这群人的。

That's sort of  where I learned all this stuff.

我就是从那里学到这些东西的。

Some of the best ways to learn to work  on user growth is to actually work on a growth team.

学习处理用户增长的一些最佳方法是实际地在一个增长团队中工作。

I was fortunate to  do that for almost five years of it at Airbnb.

我有幸在Airbnb工作了近五年。

Before I start, one of  the questions that might be obvious, the answer might be obvious for some people, but  not for everyone, is sort of like why should we do this? Why is growth  important? I'm surprised how often I actually get this question, but it might be worth  thinking about it for a second.

在我开始之前，有一个问题可能是显而易见的，答案对一些人来说是显而易见的，但并不是每个人都明白，那就是我们为什么要这样做？为什么增长是重要的？我很惊讶我真的经常收到这个问题，但它可能值得思考一下。

When you make your product, some people think that  if you just put that product into the market, people will come, and people will  start using the product.

当你制作你的产品时，有些人认为如果你把产品投入市场，人们就会来，人们就会开始使用该产品。

In my experience, that's not really how the world works.

根据我的经验，这个世界并不是这样运作的。

If  you start a startup or a company that's aimed to be a startup, growth is  important because that's actually what a startup is.

如果你创办了一家创业公司或一家旨在成为初创企业的公司，那么成长是很重要的，因为这才是真正意义上的初创企业。

If you make something that has the  potential to be really big, then making that really big is sort of what a  startup is all about.

如果你做的东西有潜力成为真正的大公司，那么让它变得真正的大就是一家初创公司的意义所在。

There's actually a post that Paul Graham wrote that is called  "startup equals growth" where he talks about specifically why growth is so important for startups  and why it's not important, why not every company is a startup, or why growth  isn't important for every company, but for startups, it's really, really important.

保罗·格雷厄姆写了一篇叫做“创业等于增长”的文章，他具体谈到了为什么成长对初创企业如此重要，为什么它并不重要，为什么不是每一家公司都是初创企业，或者为什么增长对每个公司都不重要，但对于初创企业来说，它真的非常重要。

I'll talk in  a second and sort of like what it means to be intentional about growth, but  the first question you kind of have to answer yes to is sort of like  I have a startup, I want to grow, now, how do we go about doing  that? Who is this talk for? In my experience, the kind of things you work  on when you work on user growth started with consumer companies.

我马上就会说出关于增长的意图意味着什么，但是你必须回答是的第一个问题是，我有一家初创公司，我想要成长，现在，我们该怎么做呢？这是给谁说的？根据我的经验，当你致力于用户增长的时候，你所做的事情都是从消费公司开始的。

Those were the kind  of companies that started embracing a lot of the tactics and strategies and technologies that  growth teams were doing.

这些公司开始接受成长团队所做的许多策略、策略和技术。

Now, I would argue that almost every company that sells anything  online or get users online should be or could be using a lot of the  skills and knowledge that I'm going to talk about today.

现在，我想说的是，几乎每一家在网上销售任何东西或让用户上网的公司都应该或可能使用我今天将要讨论的许多技能和知识。

You don't need to be  just consumer company.

你不需要仅仅是一家消费公司。

You don't need to be just a social network to apply these  things.

你不需要仅仅是一个社交网络来应用这些东西。

These are applicable to a wide range of companies.

这些适用于范围广泛的公司。

If you're a B2B company  and are excellent at growth, you have a massive advantage to other companies in your  space because they are probably not going to spend as much time doing growth as  you are.

如果你是一家B2B公司，并且在成长方面很出色，那么在你的领域里，你就比其他公司有着巨大的优势，因为他们可能不会像你那样花那么多的时间去做增长。

Now, there is one type of companies who this is relevant for but  too early.

现在，有一种类型的公司与此相关，但为时尚早。

That actually might apply to most of you right now, and this is  why this talk is dangerous because working on growth at the wrong time in your  company's history can be really, really bad for you.

这实际上可能适用于你们中的大多数人，这也是为什么这篇演讲很危险的原因，因为在公司历史上错误的时间从事增长工作对你来说非常糟糕。

It's sort of like when you  are kind of off to the races a little bit too ahead of time.

这有点像当你有点提前参加比赛的时候。

The  most important thing, which is what a lot of lecturers here at Startup School is  about is how you make something people want and how you actually find a product  market fit.

最重要的是，很多在创业学校的讲师都是关于你如何制造出人们想要的东西，以及你如何真正找到合适的产品市场。

If you apply a lot of the things that I'm going to talk  about here to a company that hasn't built something people want or haven't actually found  product market fit, really bad things happen.

如果你把我要说的很多东西应用到一家没有建立人们想要的东西或者还没有发现产品市场适合的公司的话，很糟糕的事情就会发生。

You will very often, and this is a  very common graph, grow like crazy in the beginning, but then when you realize that  sort of like that fuel that you had isn't fueling anything, it's just fuel that  kind of evaporates, you'll come straight down.

你会经常，这是一个很常见的图表，一开始就像疯了一样，但是当你意识到那种燃料不是在为任何东西加油，它只是那种蒸发的燃料，你就会直接下降。

That's why it's dangerous, and then I can  go into more details about that in a second, of applying some of these things  before you actually have a product market fit.

这就是为什么这是危险的，然后我可以深入到更多的细节，在这一秒，应用这些东西之前，你真正的产品市场适合。

The first thing I'm talking about today  is going to be around measurement around product market fit because that's actually the most  essential part for continuing growth.

我今天要说的第一件事是围绕产品市场的契合度来衡量，因为这实际上是持续增长的最重要的部分。

Now, do growth teams have impact or are growth teams  sort of like ...

现在，成长团队有影响力还是成长团队有点像.

How do you know that growth teams actually matter? How do  you know that these things matter? I'm going to talk about it as well.

你怎么知道成长团队真的很重要？你怎么知道这些事很重要？我也要谈谈这件事。

I'm  going to talk about experimentation, but before I get there, I want to tell you  a story from Facebook.

我要谈谈实验，但在我到达之前，我想给大家讲一个来自Facebook的故事。

This is not a story I came up with myself.

这不是我自己想出来的故事。

I  found it on one of the talks from Facebook.

我在Facebook的一次谈话中发现的。

I think it's so essential for  describing the level of impact you can have if you are applying these kind of  skillsets to a company.

我认为，如果你把这些技能运用到一个公司中，那么它对于描述你能产生多大的影响是非常重要的。

This is the timeline of Facebook from 2004 to 2015.

这是Facebook从2004年到2015年的时间表。

It's  sort of their growth story.

这算是他们成长的故事。

Some of this is public.

其中有些是公开的。

Some of this wasn't.

有些不是。

The  one thing Facebook had, they had an excellent data science team from the early days.

Facebook拥有的一件事是，他们在早期就拥有一支优秀的数据科学团队。

 They were really good at measuring, sort of like forecasting how big Facebook was going  to be.

他们非常擅长测量，就像预测Facebook会有多大一样。

So back in 2006, 2007, when Facebook has just started the growth team,  they had a bunch of data scientists doing this sort of forecasting.

所以，早在2006年，2007年，Facebook刚刚成立增长团队的时候，他们就有很多数据科学家在做这样的预测。

How big will  Facebook eventually be? They looked at all the type of metrics that Facebook had, and  they came to the conclusions that Facebook will be roughly be 400 million users by  2015.

Facebook最终会有多大？他们研究了Facebook拥有的所有指标，得出的结论是，到2015年，Facebook的用户数将达到4亿左右。

That was their forecast by using all the data they had.

利用他们所有的数据，这就是他们的预测。

We know that  wasn't really true.

我们知道那不是真的。

They actually started growing really fast in 2008, 2009.

实际上，它们在2008年、2009年开始快速增长。

This actually, as  a result of something the growth team came up with.

实际上，这是增长团队想出的结果。

Anyone here had an idea  of what would make Facebook grow so fast in 2008, roughly 2007, 2008.

这里的任何人都知道什么会使Facebook在2008年，大约2007年，2008年增长如此之快。

Audience: Didn't they open it to high school students.

观众：他们不是向高中生开放了吗？

Gustaf A.: Opening to high school students.

古斯塔夫A：向高中生开放。

Yes, they did, but that wasn't as big of a  growth.

是的，他们做到了，但这并不是很大的增长。

Newsfeed was 2005.

新闻提要是2005年。

Sorry? Recession.

抱歉的经济衰退。

Recession did not.

经济衰退并没有。

No.

否

10 friends on ...

10个朋友在.。

Yeah.

嗯

 That's good.

那很好。

That's sort of like the growth story all across.

这有点像到处都是增长的故事。

Audience: Image tagging.

观众：图像标记。

Gustaf A.: Image tagging.

图像标记。

Could've been that.

可能是那样的。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Translations is the answer.

古斯塔夫答：翻译就是答案。

So this is surprising for many of you might, maybe, but  this is actually core part of many growth teams is that you want to make  your product available for as many people in the world, and Facebook started sort of  hitting the limit on people that spoke English, and then assumed that people, just because  Facebook was in English and ...

对你们中的许多人来说，这也许是令人惊讶的，但事实上，这是许多成长团队的核心部分，那就是你想让你的产品提供给世界上同样多的人，而Facebook开始对说英语的人施加限制，然后假设是人，仅仅因为Facebook是用英语和.

Sorry.

抱歉的

That the content were in your local language  and Facebook were in English, it would continue to scale.

内容是用你的当地语言和Facebook是英语，它将继续扩大。

That wasn't the case.

事实并非如此。

They  implemented this new platform that automatically translated Facebook into hundreds of languages, and the growth  re-accelerated.

他们实现了这个新平台，可以自动将facebook翻译成数百种语言，而且增长速度也在加快。

Now the some thing started happen again.

现在一些事情又开始发生了。

I think they call this lockdown.

我想他们称之为封锁。

They  were doing very important things.

他们在做非常重要的事情。

In 2010, 2011, something very big was happening, and Facebook  had to make some really large changes, to some extent also driven by using data  to figure out these things.

2010年，2011年，一些非常重要的事情正在发生，Facebook不得不做出一些非常大的改变，在某种程度上也是由数据来解决这些问题。

Any idea what happened in 2010? It was a really  big acceleration.

知道2010年发生了什么吗？加速度真的很大。

Mobile.

移动。

I heard mobile.

我听到手机响了。

So actually what happening is that the data scientists  at Facebook were forecasting Facebook to be about 700 million users, something like that.

事实上，Facebook的数据科学家们预测Facebook的用户将达到7亿左右，就像这样。

Because  most of those people using Facebook on computers, they hadn't intended this massive shift that  was happening in 2010, 2011, which is people getting a smartphones.

因为大多数人在电脑上使用Facebook，他们并没有打算在2010年，2011年，也就是人们买一部智能手机的时候发生这种巨大的变化。

Facebook switching the entire  team, they had even have large training classes for engineers to start learning mobile.

Facebook改变了整个团队，他们甚至开设了大型培训课程，让工程师们开始学习手机。

This  was the big change that happened then.

这是当时发生的重大变化。

And then actually one more thing happened sort  of like in 2013, 2014 where they made a forecast, they were kind of not  hitting the ceiling of growth again, but then something again happened.

实际上，还有一件事发生在2013年，2014年，他们做了一个预测，他们没有再次达到增长的上限，但后来又发生了一些事情。

Any idea what happened  sort of 2013, 2014.

你知道2013年和2014年发生了什么吗？

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

 Instagram.

Instagram

 Instagram [inaudible] .

Instagram[听不见]

Gustaf A.: Instagram and Whatapps could be good answers.

Instagram和WhatApps可能是很好的答案。

That's not what I'm looking for here.

这不是我要找的。

Audience: Messenger.

观众：信使。

Gustaf A.: Messenger is a good answer.

古斯塔夫答：“信使”是一个很好的答案。

It's not what I'm looking for.

这不是我要找的。

So Facebook actually running  into the ceiling of the internet, the number of people actually that were online, so  they started this thing called internet.org, which was intended to get more people online.

所以Facebook实际上进入了互联网的上限，网络上的人数，所以他们启动了一个叫做internet.org的项目，目的是让更多的人上网。

They  went to carriers.

他们去了航空母舰。

They basically worked with carriers to get people online to get free  Facebook.

他们基本上与运营商合作，让人们在网上获得免费的Facebook。

This is actually where a very important portion of the continuous growth of Facebook.

这实际上是Facebook持续增长的一个非常重要的部分。

 Now, what can we learn from this? Well, we can learn that the initial forecast  of Facebook's growth was about 400 million people, but Facebook today is at 2 point,  I don't know, 1, 2.2 billion-user platform, so it's a very large platform, and the  forecast were wrong.

现在，我们能从中学到什么？嗯，我们可以知道，Facebook最初的增长预测是4亿人，但我不知道，Facebook现在已经达到了22亿用户平台的2点，所以它是一个非常大的平台，而且这个预测是错误的。

Now, the forecast wasn't wrong.

现在，预测并没有错。

It just didn't intend to take into  account everything great that the company was going to do.

它只是不打算把公司将要做的一切都考虑进去。

If there's anything we can  learn from this is that if you're intentional growth and you are really trying to  break through these forecasts and these ceilings, you can grow really, really fast.

如果我们能从中学到什么-如果你是有意的增长，你真的在试图打破这些预测和这些上限，你可以非常、非常快地增长。

This applies  to every company.

这适用于每一家公司。

I show this graph to everyone that joined Airbnb and be like  everyone that joined growth team at Airbnb and try to get them to think in  the same way.

我向所有加入Airbnb的人展示了这个图表，就像每个加入Airbnb增长团队的人一样，并试图让他们以同样的方式思考。

So natural adoption, which is sort of like that initial forecast of  how fast your project's growing without any of that work, is always going to eventually  slow down, but if you do the things that you do as a growth team,  you can't continue to push the growth of your company.

所以自然采用，就像你的项目在没有任何工作的情况下增长速度的最初预测一样，最终都会放缓，但是如果你作为一个成长团队去做你所做的事情，你就不能继续推动你的公司的成长。

Now, I mentioned this before.

我之前提过这个。

 Having a growth teams before you find product and market fit isn't really useful.

在你找到合适的产品和市场之前，有一个成长的团队是没有用的。

So  let's talk about product market fit.

那么，让我们来谈谈产品市场的契合。

It's a important term, but it's hard to exactly  define what it is.

这是一个重要的术语，但很难准确地定义它是什么。

One way that I think about measuring product market fit is  these two things.

我认为衡量产品市场契合度的一种方法是这两件事。

First, you find the metric.

首先，你找到了度量。

You can do this for yourself after  this talk.

你可以在这次谈话后为自己做这件事。

Find the metric that represents the value that your customers get from your  product, and then you measure the repeat usage of that metric.

找到代表客户从产品中获得的价值的度量，然后度量该度量的重复使用。

It sounds pretty simple,  and we'll see, let's see if it works.

听起来很简单，让我们看看它是否有效。

You can make this kind of table  if you want where you have the company, you have the metric that represents the  value users get from your product and then you have the idea of frequency.

你可以制作这样的表格，如果你想要你的公司，你有一个度量，它代表用户从你的产品中获得的价值，然后你就有了频率的概念。

So  let's take Airbnb.

所以让我们以Airbnb为例。

You get value from Airbnb when you are booking and staying, so  when you're actually traveling Airbnb, that's when you find that Airbnb is really valuable.

当你预订和入住Airbnb的时候，你会从Airbnb那里得到价值，所以当你真正在Airbnb旅行时，你会发现Airbnb真的很有价值。

It's  amazing experience.

这是一次奇妙的经历。

Unfortunately, people don't do that more than annually, so if you want to  figure out the product market fit of it, Airbnb, you can always ask people after  their first stay, but you wouldn't really know until they book again.

不幸的是，人们不会每年都这么做，所以如果你想弄清楚Airbnb的产品市场是否合适，你可以在他们第一次入住之后询问他们，但直到他们再次预订时，你才会真正知道。

When they come  back and book again.

等他们回来再订票的时候。

Because the booking cycles for traveler's so slow, annual would be  a good metric here.

因为旅客的预订周期太慢，每年都是一个很好的指标。

Let's take Facebook.

我们来看看脸书吧。

So Facebook, if you come back to Facebook  being and voluntarily coming back to Facebook, as an active user, you're doing that because  you find value.

所以，如果你回到Facebook，自愿回到Facebook，作为一个活跃的用户，你这么做是因为你找到了价值。

That's something that makes you come back to Facebook or Instagram or  anything like that.

这会让你回到Facebook或者Instagram或者其他类似的地方。

And the question then is how often should I come back? Well,  probably daily or hourly or something like that.

问题是我应该多久回来一次？嗯，可能是每天或每小时或诸如此类的事情。

They started looking at monthly, and then  they went down to daily.

他们开始每月看一看，然后每天都看下去。

I think they might be even going more than that.

我想他们可能会做得更多。

 Let's talk about Gusto.

我们谈谈古斯托吧。

What's the product value as a customer of Gusto that you  get out of using Gusto? Well, when you run your payroll, which is what sort  of what Gusto do for your employees, this is one of best ways to measure  the value you get out of Gusto, and how often do you do that? Well,  you run payroll every other week or every month.

作为Gusto的客户，你从使用Gusto获得的产品价值是多少？嗯，当你管理你的工资，这就是Gusto为你的员工做的事情，这是衡量你从Gusto那里得到的价值的最好方法之一，你多久这么做一次？好吧，你每隔一周或每个月处理一次工资。

I'm not going to go into  the details of all of this, but for Lyft, it might be rides.

我不打算详细讨论这一切，但对Lyft来说，可能是骑马。

For Checker,  it might be background checks.

对于Checker来说，可能是背景调查。

For Stripe, it might be transactions.

对于Stripe来说，可能是交易。

Now, for your company,  you should figure out what is the one metric that I can measure easily, every  day or every time it happens, and what's the ideal frequency through which that should  happen? If you can answer those two questions, you can make a cohort analysis of  your own company right now and you can start trying to figure out if you  have product market fit.

现在，对于你的公司来说，你应该弄清楚什么是我能轻易测量的指标，每天或每次发生的时候，以及发生这种情况的理想频率是多少？如果你能回答这两个问题，你现在就可以对你自己的公司做一个队列分析，你可以开始试着找出你是否适合产品市场。

Then, you want to measure these things, so you take a  graph.

然后，你想要测量这些东西，所以你需要一个图表。

On one axis you have time, and the other one you have the metric  that we just decided.

在一个轴上有时间，另一个轴有我们刚刚决定的度量。

From that, you can try to figure out if you have  a product market fit This company is measuring this on a weekly basis.

从这一点上，你可以试着找出你是否有一个适合的产品市场，这家公司每周都在衡量这一点。

The ideal  use case of this company is using this product on a weekly basis, so every  week here, there's a dot, which is the percent of people that use this product  on Week One.

这个公司的理想用例是每周使用这个产品，所以这里每周都有一个点，这是在第一周使用这个产品的人的百分比。

The first time they used it, they used it again.

他们第一次使用它，就再次使用它。

Let's take  Startup School as an example.

让我们以创业学校为例。

So I join Startup School, and in Week One, only  60% would come back to Startup School, and then in Week Four, only 30% would  come back.

所以我加入了创业学校，在第一周，只有60%的人会回到创业学校，然后在第四周，只有30%的人会回来。

Well, that would suggest that Startup School, we wouldn't be a great product,  but that would be a good way to measure if Startup School is actually a  good product.

好吧，这意味着创业学校，我们不会是一个伟大的产品，但这将是一个很好的方法来衡量，如果创业学校实际上是一个好产品。

People come back to all the content that we're creating.

人们回到我们正在创作的所有内容。

I'll take another  product.

我要另一种产品。

This is a great product.

这是一个伟大的产品。

This is kind of like a normal product ...

这有点像普通的产品.。

 an old product would like because almost always, you have a little bit too many  people in the beginning of the product, and then it will go down over time,  but it will sort of flatten out where you keep measuring these events of your  metrics.

一个老产品会喜欢，因为几乎总是，你有太多的人在产品的开始，然后它会下降，随着时间的推移，但它会在一定程度上扁平化，你一直在测量这些事件的度量标准。

This might sound technical, but it's actually just a representation of how many people  each dot it is, how many people that's using your product for that metric that  you decided on that time window.

这听起来可能是技术性的，但实际上它只是一个表示，每个点是多少人，有多少人用你的产品作为你在那个时间窗口上决定的指标。

Most good products flatten out.

大多数好的产品都被压平了。

Let's look at some  examples here.

让我们看看这里的一些例子。

So these are examples that based on payment retention.

因此，这些是基于支付保留的例子。

This is a company  that you have all heard of that retains 10% after one month, and then 12%  after 12 months.

这是一家你们都听说过的公司，在一个月后保留10%，12个月后保留12%。

It's sort of like unusual.

有点不寻常。

Who can that be.

那会是谁呢。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Male: Stripe.

男：条纹。

Gustaf A.: This is too hard.

古斯塔夫：这太难了。

This is Shopify.

这是Shopify。

Shopify have this product where a lot of  people sign up, not that many people continue in Month Two, but then they kind  of stick on forever.

Shopify有很多人注册这个产品，不是很多人在第二个月继续，而是他们会永远坚持下去。

What do we know from this? Well, if this curve would  go down to zero or sort of keep going down, then Shopify would be a  bad product.

我们从中知道些什么？嗯，如果这条曲线下降到零，或者继续下降，那么Shopify将是一个糟糕的产品。

It wouldn't be something that actually found product market fit and shouldn't be  working on growth.

这并不是真正适合产品市场的东西，也不应该致力于增长。

In this case, they have good product market fit, and they should  be working on growth.

在这种情况下，他们有良好的产品市场适合，他们应该致力于增长。

They should do all they can to continue working on growth.

他们应该尽其所能继续致力于经济增长。

 They should do something about the initial onboarding here where they lose a lot of  people in the beginning, but they should be working on growth.

他们应该采取一些措施，在这里的初期，他们失去了很多人，但他们应该致力于增长。

Here's another company.

这是另一家公司。

50%  retention after one month, and then 10% after 24 months.

一个月后保留50%，24个月后再保留10%。

Sort of similar to Shopify,  but they continue to lose users all the way down to even 24 months.

这有点类似于Shopify，但用户的流失一直持续到24个月。

Maybe  there's some flattening out at the very end here, but even 12 months after people  start paying for this product, every month, fewer and fewer pay for the product.

也许在这个产品的末尾有一些变平了，但是即使在人们开始为这个产品付费12个月之后，每个月，对这个产品的支付也越来越少。

Is  this a product market fit? Hard to say, but it's not an obvious case that  they have found product market fit.

这是一个适合的产品市场吗？很难说，但这并不是一个明显的例子，他们发现产品市场适合。

So this is Blue Apron.

这是蓝色四月号。

Here's one that's pretty  good.

这里有一个相当不错的。

70% retention after 12 months, and then 30% after seven years.

12个月后保留率为70%，7年后为30%。

This company definitely  have a product market fit.

这家公司肯定有一个适合市场的产品。

Any ideas which company this might be? You're all using  it.

知道这是哪家公司吗？你们都在用它。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Amazon.

亚马逊。

I heard Amazon, but it wasn't the right one.

我听说了亚马逊，但那不是正确的。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Apple.

苹果。

No.

否

This is Netflix.

这是Netflix。

So 70% of people that start paying for Netflix, pay  for Netflix seven years down the line.

因此，70%的人开始为Netflix付费，七年后再为Netflix付费。

That's definitely a company with product market fit.

那绝对是一家适合产品市场的公司。

 They should spend everything they can working on growth.

他们应该把他们所能做的一切都花在经济增长上。

Raise your hand if you're measuring  your retention right now.

如果你现在正在测量你的保持状态，就举起你的手。

Not that many people.

没那么多人。

Well, there are other ways to figure  out retention.

还有其他方法可以找到保留。

If you're really small, you should go out and talk to users.

如果你真的很小，你应该出去和用户交谈。

You  should ask them questions such as, "How would you feel if you can no longer  use my product?" and should sort of like say as close as you can to  users.

你应该问他们这样的问题：“如果你不能再使用我的产品，你会有什么感觉？”应该尽可能接近用户。

This is like measuring retention like this, it's very hard when you have 10  users.

这就像测量这样的保留量，当你有10个用户时，这是非常困难的。

When you have 1,000, it's easier.

当你有1000人的时候，就更容易了。

But when you have 10 users, this is  not the way to do it.

但是当你有10个用户时，这不是方法。

You can actually go and just talk to all  of them in person.

你可以亲自去和他们所有人谈谈。

There are other ways to measure it, but you sort of  have to know that you have a product that's retaining.

有其他方法来衡量它，但你必须知道你有一个产品是保留的。

Otherwise, you shouldn't be working  on growth because you're going to end up burning a lot cycles on things that  doesn't matter.

否则，你不应该致力于增长，因为你最终会在不重要的事情上消耗很多周期。

A lot of people might be wondering how does growth and marketing relate  to each other? Is it the same thing, or how should I think about it?  Historically, the way you had a company 20 years ago is you had a product  team that made a product, and then you had the marketing team or product marketing  team that marketed the product.

很多人可能想知道增长和市场营销之间有什么关系？是同一件事，还是我该怎么想？从历史上看，20年前你有一家公司，你有一个生产产品的产品团队，然后你有营销团队或产品营销团队来推销产品。

That's how things used to work.

事情过去就是这样运作的。

A lot of hierarchies  in companies or organizations are still based on this idea that you had a product  team that's separate from the marketing team, and these are different teams and different skillsets,  and engineers work over in the product team, and then the marketing people work over  in the marketing team.

很多公司或组织的层级结构仍然是基于这样的理念，即你有一个独立于营销团队的产品团队，这些是不同的团队和不同的技能，工程师在产品团队中工作，然后营销人员在营销团队中工作。

Actually, it's not how things work anymore.

事实上，事情不再是这样了。

The way you should  think about this is that, I'm going to come to this in a second, is  that there's three different types of people that can, organizations that can drive growth.

你应该这么想，我马上就要讲到这一点，有三种不同类型的人，可以推动增长的组织。

There  is what I call a product growth engineering.

我称之为产品增长工程。

This has different names.

这有不同的名字。

This is effectively  product managers, engineers, data scientists, and sometimes marketers that work on growth, but they work  on growth using technology.

这实际上是产品经理、工程师、数据科学家，有时是营销人员，他们致力于增长，但他们使用技术进行增长。

They're actively changing the product to drive more growth, and much  of this work here is about people that already arrived to your product but haven't  really found the value of your product, and they're changing the product to make it  grow faster.

他们正在积极地改变产品以推动更多的增长，这里的大部分工作都是关于那些已经到达你的产品但还没有真正找到你产品的价值的人，他们正在改变产品以使它增长得更快。

Conversion optimizations fall into this group.

转换优化属于这个组。

Some of the growth challenge actually fall  into this group.

一些增长挑战实际上属于这个群体。

Now, there's this big other group here, performance marketing, which is effectively  Google and Facebook marketing, which is also super technical and super data-driven.

现在，这里还有另一个很大的团队，表现营销，这实际上是谷歌和facebook的营销，它也是超级技术和超级数据驱动的。

I would argue  that these things are very, very similar.

我认为这些东西非常相似。

Five or 10 years ago, you would go  to a company, you would see these being very different groups, maybe different floors in  the office.

五到十年前，你会去一家公司，你会看到这些人是非常不同的群体，可能是办公室里不同的楼层。

Now they, in my opinion, should sit together.

现在，在我看来，他们应该坐在一起。

So engineers should sit together  with performance marketers and vice versa because they actually are doing very similar things.

因此，工程师应该和业绩营销者坐在一起，反之亦然，因为他们实际上在做非常相似的事情。

Now,  there's this fifth button, fifth things should be number three here, which is brand marketing.

现在，这里有第五个按钮，第五个东西应该是第三个，那就是品牌营销。

 Brand marketing is sort of like the hardest to measure type of marketing where you're  not really having a direct response, you're not having someone directly giving you feedback on  how that marketing perceived.

品牌营销是最难衡量的营销类型，当你没有真正的直接反应，你没有人直接给你反馈的营销是如何感觉到的。

You can't even measure that very easily, so this is not  something that startups should be doing in the early days.

你甚至不能很容易地衡量，所以这不是创业初期应该做的事情。

In my opinion, startups should  not be brand marketing until way down the line when they hit the limits on  these two things.

在我看来，初创企业在这两件事上达到极限之前，不应该是品牌营销。

Startups should be doing these two things, and there's some qualifications through  which you can do this, but almost everyone can do this.

创业公司应该做这两件事，你可以通过一些条件来做到这一点，但几乎每个人都可以做到这一点。

If you're a startup,  you have engineers, you can do product growth or growth engineering or things like that.

如果你是一家初创公司，你有工程师，你可以做产品增长或增长工程之类的工作。

 All right.

好的

Let's talk about that first part, product growth.

让我们谈谈第一部分，产品增长。

Your product is a funnel.

你的产品是漏斗。

 What does that mean? Your product has many, many, many steps betweens the first user  and the person sort of like completing what they're trying to do on your product.

那是什么意思？你的产品有很多步骤，在第一用户和用户之间有很多步骤，就像完成他们在你的产品上所做的一样。

 Let's say I'm an e-commerce store, and I'm trying to buy something.

假设我是一家电子商务商店，我想买点东西。

There are many,  many steps in that funnel, and what the product growth team is working on is  funnel optimization or conversion rate optimization.

在这个漏斗中有许多步骤，而产品增长团队正在做的是漏斗优化或转化率优化。

If you look at what we did at Airbnb  on the growth team, many of those growth teams were conversation rate, rate optimization teams  that are working a specific part of the funnel.

如果你看看我们在Airbnb的成长团队里做了些什么，这些成长团队中有很多是交谈率，速率优化团队，他们在漏斗的特定部分工作。

So the funnel could start with  SEO, it could start with performance marketing, it could start with referrals of virality, but  it would jump through a number of different steps.

因此，漏斗可以从SEO开始，它可以从性能营销开始，它可以从病毒的推荐开始，但是它会跳过许多不同的步骤。

Say signups would be a very  common step.

说注册将是一个非常常见的步骤。

Or if you're an e-commerce site, payment conversation or buying conversion.

或者，如果你是一个电子商务网站，付款交谈或购买转换。

All of  these steps are things that as a conversation rate optimizing part of the growth team  should be working on.

所有这些步骤都是作为会话速率优化成长团队的一部分应该做的事情。

These are the some of the easiest things you got working  on.

这些是你能做的最简单的事情。

I'm going to be a little bit high level here because to go into  depth about every single area here is going to be, we can go on for  hours.

我在这里会有一点高水平，因为要深入了解这里的每一个区域，我们可以持续几个小时。

Some of the good ideas, some areas to start working on for conversation rate  optimizations, one of them is translation.

一些好的想法，一些领域开始工作的谈话率优化，其中之一是翻译。

If you have an international product that's not translated,  you should be thinking about that.

如果你有一个没有翻译的国际产品，你应该考虑一下。

That immediately drives more people to start using your  product.

这会立即驱使更多的人开始使用你的产品。

The second thing is authentication.

第二件事是身份验证。

Most of your products probably have some idea of  user accounts where you can sign up to your product and you can come back  and log into your product.

您的大多数产品可能对用户帐户有一些了解，您可以在那里注册您的产品，然后您可以回来登录您的产品。

You'd be surprised how much, how hard this is.

你会惊讶于这有多难。

From  Airbnb, I know we spent many years working on just authentication.

在Airbnb，我知道我们花了很多年在认证上。

Signing up and logging  in.

注册并登录。

It sounds so simple, but it turns out that's a very fragile moment of  users sort of like flowing through your product, but you can always continue to make  optimizations.

这听起来很简单，但事实证明，这是一个非常脆弱的时刻，用户在某种程度上像是在你的产品中流动，但你可以继续进行优化。

If you go to Airbnb and you go to Pinterest today, assume that whatever  is there in terms of authentication is the most optimized version.

如果您今天去Airbnb并访问Pinterest，那么假设在身份验证方面的任何内容都是最优化的版本。

These companies spend enormous  amount of time optimizing signup conversion.

这些公司花费了大量的时间来优化注册转换。

Another big area of for conversion rate optimization is  onboarding.

另一大领域的转化率优化是上机。

So when I come to your product, what's the first thing I experience and  what can the product do to bring me towards the value of the product as  quickly as possible? Those are things that you work on when you're working on onboarding.

所以，当我谈到你们的产品时，我的第一件事是什么，这个产品能做些什么来使我尽快实现产品的价值呢？这些都是你在上岗时所做的事情。

 And then another big area here is purchase conversion, so sort of like when I'm  about to buy something, a product and actually can take the final decision around what  you do, there's so many things you can do here.

另外一个很大的领域是购买转换，就像当我要买东西的时候，一个产品实际上可以围绕你做的事情做出最后的决定，你可以在这里做很多事情。

All right.

好的

So then, there  is something called growth channels.

因此，有一种叫做增长渠道的东西。

So what is a growth channels? Growth channels is how  people discover your product.

那么什么是增长渠道呢？增长渠道是人们发现你产品的方式。

Now, when you're a small company, and I don't know how  big you guys are, but let's say you have less than 50 users.

现在，当你是一家小公司的时候，我不知道你们有多大，但是假设你们的用户还不到50个。

You shouldn't  really be thinking about growth channels.

你不应该真的在考虑增长渠道。

Even if you have less than 5,000 users, you  probably shouldn't be thinking about this because it's too early.

即使你的用户少于5，000，你也不应该考虑这个问题，因为现在还太早。

But the things that you  do when you're small that don't scale have the word don't scale in it for  reason.

但是当你很小的时候，你所做的事情，如果没有规模的话，那就不要因为原因而在它中扩展。

They don't actually scale.

它们实际上不缩放。

There are very few companies who kind of grow big  without growing in one of these scalable growth channels.

很少有公司在没有这些可扩展的增长渠道的情况下发展壮大。

There are not that many platforms,  and the channel/platform can be used in the same way.

没有那么多的平台，通道/平台可以用同样的方式使用。

There are not that many  things that are really, really big in the world on which you can build a  large company.

在这个世界上，没有那么多东西能让你建立一家大公司。

Let's talk about what those channels are.

让我们谈谈这些频道是什么。

The first thing here is basically  you think through the behavior of your product, and let's talk about the first one  here, which is, if the way I discover your product is a rare behavior, where  people use Google to find your solution.

这里的第一件事基本上是你考虑你的产品的行为，让我们在这里讨论第一个，如果我发现你的产品的方式是一种罕见的行为，人们用谷歌找到你的解决方案。

This is actually how very, a lot of  products in the world are being discovered.

事实上，世界上很多产品都是这样被发现的。

If you have something through which to answer  the question around what you do, once a year, you go to Google, probably if  you're building a company trying to answer the question, you should be on Google.

如果你有什么东西可以回答你做什么的问题，一年一次，你去谷歌，也许如果你正在创建一家公司试图回答这个问题，你应该在谷歌。

A  good example here might be buying a house.

这里的一个很好的例子可能是买房子。

You aren't buying a house more than  once a twice in your entire house, which means when you go and buy a  house, you're probably going to go to Google, which is not surprisingly that something like  Zillow or Redfin or all those different sites that allow you to buy homes online  are entirely optimized for SEO and sometimes paid search.

你在整个房子里买房子的次数不超过一次，这意味着当你去买房子的时候，你可能会去谷歌，这并不奇怪，像Zillow或Redfine这样的网站，或者所有允许你在网上买房子的网站，都是完全适合搜索引擎优化的，有时也是付费搜索的。

If you are using something every  day, you're not going to go back to Google every day.

如果你每天都在使用一些东西，你就不会每天回到谷歌。

You're going to go  to straight to that product.

你要直接去买那个产品。

You're going to open the app on your phone.

你要打开手机上的应用程序。

You're  going to go to the straight to the website, whatever it might be.

你会直接去网站，不管是什么。

You're not  going to go to Google anymore, just to kind of figure out which of the  different things I'm going to use.

你不会再去谷歌了，只是想弄清楚我要用哪一种不同的东西。

Now, Google is not the only search engine.

现在，谷歌并不是唯一的搜索引擎。

There  are other search engine that you can optimize for as well, but Google is the  one this all matters.

还有其他搜索引擎，你也可以优化，但谷歌是一个所有的问题。

Next behavior.

下一个行为。

Do people of my product already share the product  using word of mouth? If that's the case, then there are lots of things you  can do around virality and referrals.

我的产品的人已经用口碑分享产品了吗？如果是这样的话，那么有很多事情你可以做围绕病毒和推荐。

You can grow your product by accelerating that behavior  from existing users.

您可以通过加速现有用户的这种行为来增长您的产品。

You can either incentivize them with referrals where you're getting paid or  you can do it for free with using virality techniques.

你可以在你得到报酬的地方通过推荐来激励他们，或者你可以免费使用病毒技术。

Does having more users of  my product actually improve my experience? So what do I mean by that? Well, if  I am building the next LinkedIn, it makes sense the product is not as valuable  when it's just all of us on LinkedIn but when it's a bunch more people  and companies on LinkedIn, it makes sense that the value kind of increases.

让更多的用户使用我的产品真的能改善我的体验吗？我这么说是什么意思？好吧，如果我要创建下一个LinkedIn，那么当LinkedIn上只有我们所有人的时候，这个产品就没有那么有价值了，但是当LinkedIn上有更多的人和公司的时候，这种价值的增加是有道理的。

Well, in  that sense, you should absolutely continue to do virality because every single user is sort  of an opportunity to bring in more users.

从这个意义上说，你绝对应该继续做病毒，因为每个用户都是一个吸引更多用户的机会。

Here's another way to think about virality.

这是另一种看待性欲的方法。

 And then, this is the common question I ask companies in sort of the early  days of YC: can you make a list, literally a spreadsheet, of all the people  in the world that would use my product? Let's say I sell to buyers who  decides to ...

然后，这是我在YC早期问公司的一个常见问题：你能把世界上所有使用我的产品的人列成一张列表，字面上说是一张电子表格吗？假设我卖给那些决定.

Doctor's offices, sell to doctor's offices.

医生办公室，卖给医生办公室。

Well, I can probably make a  list of all the doctor's offices in the United States or in California.

嗯，我可能可以列出美国或加州所有的医生办公室。

It wouldn't  be that hard.

不会那么难的。

It's totally possible.

完全有可能。

So I would find a way to make that  list and then would go out and do sales.

所以我会想办法列个单子，然后出去做销售。

This is surprisingly something, often, something  that you should start with.

这是令人惊讶的事情，经常，一些东西，你应该开始。

If you can make the list, if you know who  those people are, you should do go and do sales.

如果你能列出清单，如果你知道这些人是谁，你应该去做销售。

The last one here is  does my users have high LTV? Do I charge enough for my product for it  to be valuable? Well, then I should definitely go and do, pay the acquisition for  example, Google and Facebook.

最后一个是我的用户有高的LTV吗？我的产品值钱吗？好吧，那我一定要去做，支付收购的费用，比如谷歌和Facebook。

I shouldn't do acquisitions or paid ads unless I actually am  charging for my product.

我不应该做收购或付费广告，除非我实际上是收费的我的产品。

All right.

好的

I'm going to go through each one of these.

我要把每一个都看一遍。

 It's not going to be possible to go into super deep detail for all of  them, but I'm going to go into, a little bit deeper into some of them  and not the others.

不可能为所有的人深入到超深的细节，但我要深入一些，更深入一些，而不是其他的。

All right.

好的

Let's talk about referrals.

我们来谈谈转介的事吧。

So I worked on the  referral program at Airbnb for a very long time.

所以我在Airbnb工作了很长一段时间。

The way to think about referrals  is sort of a engineered word of month.

考虑转介的方式是一个每月的设计字。

So if people are already talking about  your product, referrals is a way through which you can engineer more people talking about  your product.

因此，如果人们已经在谈论您的产品，推荐是一种可以让更多的人谈论您的产品的方法。

One way could be just making it easier.

一种方法就是让事情变得更简单。

Another way could be by  using financial incentives.

另一种方法可以是通过财政激励。

So in the Airbnb referral program, we had a financial incentive where  as a referrer, I would make $20 for every users I would sign up in  travel credit, and as a referee, I would get $40 as a new user of  Airbnb in travel credits.

因此，在Airbnb推荐项目中，我们有一个经济激励机制，作为一个推荐人，我将为我注册的每个用户提供20美元的旅游信贷，作为一名裁判员，我将作为Airbnb的新用户获得40美元的旅行积分。

We would kind of start with that principle and then try  to get as many people what we call through our referral funnels as possible.

我们会从这个原则开始，然后尝试通过我们的推荐漏斗让尽可能多的人得到我们所称的东西。

You  notice I used the word funnel here again.

你注意到我又用漏斗这个词了。

Every product is a funnel.

每个产品都是漏斗。

Even the  referral product, which is a sort of a product of itself, inside Airbnb, had its  own funnel.

就连Airbnb内部的推介产品也有自己的漏斗。

I'm not going to go through all of these details, but the way  you think about something that's kind of engineering and product-led is that you break it  down into different steps, and then you measure every single one of these steps, and  then you kind of measure the conversion rate to the very end.

我不打算讨论所有这些细节，但是你思考某种工程和产品主导的东西的方式是，你把它分解成不同的步骤，然后你测量这些步骤中的每一个，然后你测量到最后的转换率。

The first step  here is weekly active users that saw the referral program.

这里的第一步是每周活跃的用户，他们看到了推荐程序。

So how many users saw  the referral program? If I wasn't measuring this step, I wouldn't know how many people  did that.

那么有多少用户看过推荐程序呢？如果我没有衡量这一步，我就不知道有多少人这样做了。

When we started measuring this step, and I've seen this with many other  companies who have a referral program, is that a small percentage of your active users  see the referral program.

当我们开始测量这一步时，我在许多其他有推荐程序的公司中看到了这一点，那就是你的活跃用户中有一小部分看到了推荐程序。

Well, how could you be expected to use it if you  can't see it? We started measuring this in the early days of Airbnb.

如果你看不见，怎么会被期望使用它呢？我们在Airbnb的早期就开始测量这一点。

Turns out  that there's a lot of opportunity of just telling people about you having a referral  program, but then there's all these opportunities to optimize through that funnel.

结果是有很多机会告诉人们你有一个推荐计划，但是还有很多机会可以通过这个漏斗来优化。

There is people  sending invites, how many they send to, the conversion rate to new users, to new  guest, and finally to them booking their first 10 nights.

有一些人发送邀请，他们发送了多少，转换率给新用户，新客人，最后是他们预订他们的头10个晚上。

Here's another display.

这是另一个展览。

This slide  is going to be available online afterwards, so you don't have to take notes or  photos.

这张幻灯片将在网上发布，这样你就不用做笔记或拍照了。

We kind of separate the funnel into even more detail, and we would continue  to optimize this for years.

我们把漏斗分成更多的细节，我们将继续优化这几年。

Like thus all matters a lot, and we would continue  to optimize for years.

就像这样，一切都很重要，我们将继续优化多年。

I'm going to go through one example of sort of like  one of those conversion rate optimizations we did for the referral program.

我将介绍一个例子，类似于我们为推荐程序所做的那些转化率优化。

So here is  their referral invite email.

这是他们的推荐信，邀请电子邮件。

If someone else, if I invited someone ...

如果其他人，如果我邀请了某人.。

One of you  guys, you would get one of these emails.

你们中的一个会收到一封这样的电子邮件。

The email would say, "Gustaf Alströmer invited  you to Airbnb.

邮件会说：“Gustaf Alstr mer邀请你去Airbnb。

Gustaf sent you $40 on your first trip on Airbnb.

古斯塔夫第一次去Airbnb给你寄了40美元。

You can  book a room, small loft.

你可以订个房间，小阁楼。

Just sign up by 25th of May, 2018," and then  there's a button they call "Accept invitation," and then there's a photo of me and  my name.

只要在2018年5月25日之前注册，“然后有一个按钮叫做”接受邀请“，然后有一张我和我名字的照片。

Looks pretty good.

看上去不错。

Now, this email is result of dozens of experiments.

现在，这封电子邮件是几十个实验的结果。

Nothing  here is random.

这里没有什么是随机的。

Everything here is for reason.

这里的一切都是有道理的。

Let's talk about that.

让我们谈谈这个。

The first one  is the subject line.

第一个是主题。

The subject line has my name.

标题上有我的名字。

If it's sent to any  of my friends, that make them more likely to open it.

如果寄给我的朋友，他们就更有可能打开它。

The headline of the  email have a clear value.

这封邮件的标题很有价值。

It's very, very clear what this email is about.

很清楚这封邮件是关于什么的。

You'd  be surprised how many emails that don't have a clear headline and a clear of  value of what the email is about.

你会惊讶于有多少电子邮件没有一个清晰的标题和清楚的价值的电子邮件是关于什么的。

This email is about that I sent you  $40 on your first trip on this website called Airbnb.

这封电子邮件是关于我在你第一次访问这个名为Airbnb的网站上给你发了40美元。

This, which is "Sign up  by May 25th, 2018" is urgency.

这是“2018年5月25日之前签约”的紧迫性。

You should sign up by May 25th, 2018.

你应该在2018年5月25日前注册。

That's  the urgency that makes you actually go, that increases the chance of people who see  this email actually go and do it.

这就是让你真正离开的迫切性，这增加了看到这封电子邮件的人去做这件事的机会。

The name here, "Accept invitation," it a sense  of exclusivity.

这里的名字是“接受邀请”，这是一种排他性的感觉。

It doesn't say "Sign up" for a reason.

它没有说“注册”是有原因的。

Because sign up, anyone can  sign up.

因为注册，任何人都可以注册。

By accepting an invitation sends an idea of exclusivity.

通过接受邀请，传递出一种排他性的想法。

Finally, it has my  name, where I live, and how long I've been a user of Airbnb with my  photo.

最后，它有我的名字，我住在哪里，我用我的照片使用Airbnb多久了。

That's really strong social proof that I endorsed this website.

这是我支持这个网站的有力的社会证明。

I endorsed this product.

我背书了这个产品。

 The way you think about this is sort of how you think about all of  conversation rate optimization.

你对这件事的看法是，你如何看待所有的会话速率优化。

It's a set of optimizations.

这是一组优化。

Pay growth.

工资增长。

This is one of the  areas I'm not going too deep into the [inaudible] here.

这是我不想深入到这里(听不到)的领域之一。

The things that matter for  pay growth is that you shouldn't do it unless you have revenue.

薪酬增长的关键是，除非你有收入，否则你就不应该做这件事。

Too many companies  are buying ads when they don't have any revenue or know how they're going to  make any revenue.

太多的公司购买广告时，他们没有任何收入，或知道他们将如何赚取任何收入。

That's a big mistake.

这是个大错误。

You shouldn't be doing that.

你不该那么做。

If you have  revenue, there's a couple of concepts that really matter.

如果你有收入，有几个概念真的很重要。

The first one: how much money  am I paying for each new users that I'm acquiring? It's called customer acquisition cost  or CAC.

第一个问题：我要为每个新用户支付多少钱？这就是所谓的客户收购成本(CAC)。

What's lifetime value or payback time of the users that I have acquired  through pay growth? What that means is: what's the longest that I can, with some  level of accuracy, forecast how much these users will be worth? If a user is  paying $10 per month, and then we can have this cohort analysis that we had  in the beginning [inaudible] retention, we can figure out exactly how much our user's going  to be worth.

我通过薪酬增长获得的用户的终身价值或回报时间是多少？这意味着：在一定程度上，我能预测这些用户价值的最长值是多少？如果一个用户每月支付10美元，那么我们可以进行这个队列分析，这是我们在开始(听不见)保留时所做的，我们可以准确地计算出我们的用户将会值多少钱。

If my customer acquisition cost is lower than my lifetime value, then  that's good.

如果我的客户购买成本低于我的终生价值，那就太好了。

That means you have a great payback time.

这意味着你有一个很好的回报时间。

If you only pay $20  for a user, that means if you make $10 per month, you have probably around  two months payback time.

如果你只为一个用户支付20美元，这意味着如果你每月挣10美元，你大概有两个月的回收期。

It's more complicated than that, but it's sort of like a  simplified version.

它比这更复杂，但它有点像一个简化的版本。

These are the most important concepts to keep in mind for pay growth.

这些是薪酬增长需要牢记的最重要的概念。

 Attribution.

归属。

This matters if things get complicated.

如果事情变得复杂，这很重要。

If using both Google and Facebook, if you  get into some level of scale, you need to understand what it means to attribute  a new paid user to the dollar that you spent.

如果同时使用Google和Facebook，如果你进入某种程度的规模，你需要理解把一个新的付费用户归因于你花费的美元意味着什么。

I'm not going to go  too much into detail what this means, but this is something that you should learn  if you're spending time on pay growth.

我不打算详述这意味着什么，但如果你把时间花在工资增长上，这是你应该学习的东西。

Finally, in my opinion, there are only four  channels to manage that scale: Facebook, Instagram, Google and YouTube.

最后，在我看来，只有四个渠道可以管理这个规模：Facebook、Instagram、Google和YouTube。

These are the very, very  large pay growth channels through which many companies are actually built on these days.

这些都是非常、非常大的薪酬增长渠道，这些年来，许多公司实际上都是通过这些渠道建立起来的。

One  of the unspoken truth in my opinion is that a lot of the free channels  of growth is going down, and the pay channels are going up.

在我看来，一个不言而喻的事实是，许多自由的增长渠道正在下降，而薪酬渠道正在上升。

A good example  of that is that it's hard to grow on the Facebook newsfeed unless you're paying  Facebook money.

这方面的一个很好的例子是，除非你支付Facebook的钱，否则很难在Facebook的新闻提要上成长。

Same is true for Instagram.

Instagram也是如此。

It's sort of changing always.

它总是在改变。

When there's a  new platform, they often kind of promote free users in the beginning, and then they  start to monetize that.

当有一个新的平台时，他们通常在一开始就促进免费用户，然后他们开始赚钱。

That's sort of what's happening for both Facebook, Google, and Instagram  today.

今天Facebook、Google和Instagram都是这样。

All right.

好的

Search engine optimization.

搜索引擎优化

Search engine optimization or SEO.

搜索引擎优化或搜索引擎优化。

Some people might say  well, this is something of the past.

有些人可能会说，这已经是过去的事了。

In my experience, it is not.

根据我的经验，事实并非如此。

It still  matters because as long as we go back to Google to make our decisions about  what we're going to do in the future, this matters.

这仍然很重要，因为只要我们回到谷歌，对我们将来要做的事情做出决定，这是很重要的。

Google is probably one of  the largest websites in the world.

谷歌可能是世界上最大的网站之一。

It's a big deal.

这是件大事。

The one thing you should  know about SEO is that there's a difference between what you see on a website  and what Google see.

关于搜索引擎优化，你应该知道的一件事是，你在网站上看到的和谷歌看到的是有区别的。

Google can't view images.

谷歌不能查看图片。

Google can't view JavaScript very easily.

Google不能很容易地查看JavaScript。

If  you go to Airbnb and you see all of this, just remember that Google can't  see this.

如果你去Airbnb，你看到了所有这些，只要记住，谷歌不能看到这个。

So if you're trying to communicate to someone who's searching for Stockholm on  Google or apartments in Stockholm, this is not what going to be delivered back to  Google.

因此，如果你试图与在谷歌上搜索斯德哥尔摩或斯德哥尔摩公寓的人交流，这并不是要把它送回谷歌。

Google is going to see a bunch of lines of text that which you  had marked out in your code, and that Google have hopefully indexed, if you've done  the right thing.

Google将会看到一堆你在代码中标出的文本，如果你做了正确的事情的话，谷歌希望它已经被编入索引了。

And if you haven't, then it's going to like your fault.

如果你没有，那它就会喜欢你的错。

So  there are a bunch of basics that you can do with SEO, you just have  to get right.

所以，有一堆基本的，你可以做SEO，你只需要得到正确的。

The easiest thing you can do is to run your website through  an SEO browser and try to figure out if you only saw this, would you  understand what your product is about? So using clear language, not in JavaScript to describe  what your product does is the most basic things you can do for SEO.

你能做的最简单的事情是通过搜索引擎优化浏览器运行你的网站，并试图找出如果你只看到这个，你会明白你的产品是什么吗？因此，使用清晰的语言，而不是用JavaScript来描述您的产品所做的，是您可以为SEO做的最基本的事情。

There's  two different areas of optimization for SEO.

SEO有两个不同的优化区域。

This is as high level as it gets.

这是尽可能高的水平。

 At Airbnb, there's a team of 20 people working on this of which 12 or  13 are engineers.

Airbnb有一个由20人组成的团队，其中12人或13人是工程师。

This is a really, really big deal, but this is sort of  at the high level.

这是一件非常重要的事情，但这是在很高的层次上。

There's two types of optimizations for SEO.

SEO有两种类型的优化。

There are things that  you can change on your website, and there are other people in the world that  link into your websites.

有些东西你可以在你的网站上改变，世界上还有其他人可以链接到你的网站。

This is the two main leverage that you have on SEO.

这是两个主要的杠杆，你有SEO。

 For the on-page optimization, the right way to start is not to start with like,  "Oh, let's make some changes." The right way to start is with a strategy.

对于页面上的优化，正确的开始方式不是从“哦，让我们做一些改变”开始。正确的方法是从战略开始。

What  am I trying to rank for? What key words exist on Google today that I  might want to be the number one result for? Now, to do that, you have  to do what's called a keyword analysis or a keyword research.

我想做什么？今天谷歌上存在哪些关键词，我可能想成为第一名的结果？现在，要做到这一点，你必须做一个所谓的关键字分析或关键字研究。

You have to try  to figure out what are all the things that people are searching for that might  relate to my product? And then hopefully, they have some amount of large volume that  they're searching for, and then I can try to say well, these keywords that have  a medium to high volume and they're not that much competition around these keywords, those  are the ones I want to rank for.

你必须试着找出人们正在寻找的与我的产品相关的东西是什么？然后，希望他们有大量的搜索量，然后我可以试着说，这些关键词有一个中等到高的音量，它们对这些关键词没有太多的竞争，这些都是我想要排名的关键词。

When you decided that, the other areas  around page optimizations now are easier because now you know what you're trying to rank  for.

当您决定这样做时，页面优化周围的其他区域现在更容易了，因为现在您知道了您想要排序的是什么。

At scale, but I've seen this at small scale too, SEO at this point  is about SEO experimentation, which means you can do the set of best practices in  SEO.

在规模上，但我已经看到了在小规模，SEO在这一点上是关于SEO实验，这意味着你可以做SEO的最佳实践集。

It might take you to be a decent size company.

你可能会成为一家规模可观的公司。

But if you want  to become a massive company, a really, really large company who's growing through SEO, you  have to use experimentation to make those decisions.

但是如果你想成为一家大公司，一家通过SEO成长起来的非常大的公司，你必须用实验来做那些决定。

The other thing that matter here is  off-page optimization: who's linking to you.

这里另一个重要的问题是离页面优化：谁在链接到您。

There are lots of tools you can use to  figure out who are all the websites online that links to you.

有很多工具，你可以使用找出谁是所有的在线链接到你的网站。

What's their sort  of domain, authority? Are they actually authoritative on the web to have something that's ...

他们的领域是什么，权威？他们在网络上是否真的有权威.

 There's a huge difference if I would link to your website or if The New  York Times link to your website.

如果我想链接到你的网站，或者纽约时报链接到你的网站，那就有很大的不同了。

It matters a lot in how, in Google's perception  of your site.

在谷歌对你的网站的看法中，这是非常重要的。

One surprising way that Airbnb is that we had a lot of  press, a lot of people in the world for media would come and write about  Airbnb.

Airbnb的一种令人惊讶的方式是，我们有很多媒体，世界上很多媒体都会来报道Airbnb。

That was surprisingly important for our off-page optimizations.

这对于我们的页面外优化来说是非常重要的。

If you have people writing about  you, either in press or in other areas, that's actually a great thing.

如果有人在媒体或其他领域写你的文章，那实际上是一件很棒的事情。

If you  don't have anyone writing about you, well, you're not going to have that many links  because the web have changed.

如果你没有人写你，你不会有那么多的链接，因为网络已经改变了。

There aren't that may links anymore.

不再有这种联系了。

It's not like everyone  have a website these days that are linking to each together.

现在并不是每个人都有一个链接到每一个网站的网站。

These are things have  changed.

这些事情都变了。

You have to be strategic about who are you getting links from.

你必须对你从谁那里得到的链接采取战略态度。

The easiest  way you can do is whenever you get written up by anyone, press or whatever,  just ask them to link to you.

你能做的最简单的方法是，每当你被任何人写下来，按下或其他什么，只要让他们链接到你。

It matters to you.

对你来说很重要。

The last thing I  want to talk about here is on growth teams.

我最不想谈的就是成长团队。

A growth team today is typically  engineers, data scientists, designers, product managers, end user researchers.

今天的成长团队通常是工程师、数据科学家、设计师、产品经理、最终用户研究人员。

These are not all the people  that you might have in your company today, but these are the companies that you'll  have when you start making decisions around growth.

这些人并不是你今天在公司里所有的人，但当你开始围绕成长做出决策时，你会拥有这些公司。

The way you organize a growth team  is there's sort of two options.

组织一个成长团队的方式有两种选择。

You either have the growth team as its own  team and the rest of the product is the product team.

您要么拥有成长团队作为自己的团队，而其余的产品就是产品团队。

The challenge here is  that when you're a small company and you're not kind of like somewhat ignorant about  growth, what [inaudible] often say like, "I've hired a growth engineer.

这里的挑战是，当你是一家小公司，而你并不是有点无知的增长，什么(听不见)经常说，“我雇用了一个增长工程师。

I hired growth product  manager.

我雇了成长型产品经理。

That person is going to be doing all the growth in the company." That's  sort of not really a recipe for success.

这个人将在公司里做所有的成长，“这并不是成功的秘诀。

It's kind of a fine balance between  saying everyone is responsible for growth, which doesn't work and having a small team that  is responsible for all the growth.

这是一种很好的平衡，在说每个人都要对成长负责，这是不起作用的，还有一个小团队负责所有的成长。

You kind of have to find a balance here.

你得在这里找到平衡。

 The right way to find that balance is to set very clear goals and very  clear dividing lines in your product.

找到平衡的正确方法是在产品中设定非常明确的目标和明确的分界线。

A good example here might be everyone that works  in the core product, which is sort of the value of your product ...

这里的一个很好的例子可能是每个在核心产品中工作的人，这是您的产品的价值之一.

Let's  say I am Gusto, the ...

假设我是古斯托.

Running payroll for employees is the core product.

员工工资管理是企业的核心产品。

Now,  everyone trying to get to that experience that sort of like the growth area of  Gusto.

现在，每个人都试图获得类似古斯托增长地区那样的体验。

So that would be one easy way to make distinction between growth and product.

因此，这将是区分增长和产品的一种简单方法。

 How do you decide what to work on? You make a simple calculation of what's  the effort, what's the minimal viable thing I want to try here, and sort of  how big of an outcome can that be? Always try to forecast out the outcomes  before you actually start doing the work because if you're forecasting something and at best  case scenario, it's small, you shouldn't be doing it, even though it's a low effort.

你怎么决定该做什么？你做了一个简单的计算，什么是努力，什么是最小可行的东西，我想在这里尝试，以及它能有多大的结果？在你真正开始工作之前，一定要试着预测结果，因为如果你在预测某件事，而且在最好的情况下，它是很小的，你不应该去做，即使这是一个很小的努力。

 All right.

好的

I have two small short sections left of this talk.

我还有两小段话要讲。

The first one  is called making decisions.

第一个叫做决策。

If you ask any product manager at Airbnb today, "What is  the most important tool or learning that you learned at Airbnb that you'll apply to  your next thing?" they will say experiment or experiment framework or some way of making  A/B test inside the company.

如果你今天问Airbnb的任何一个产品经理，“你在Airbnb学到的最重要的工具或学习是什么？”他们会说出公司内部进行A/B测试的实验框架或实验框架。

I'm so happy that Suhali is talking later because I  stole a quote from his investor deck that I found online.

我很高兴苏哈里晚些时候说话，因为我从他的投资平台上偷了一段我在网上找到的报价。

This is the quote:  most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using the gut.

这是一句名言：世界上的大多数人都会通过猜测或利用直觉来做出决定。

They  will either be lucky or wrong.

他们要么是幸运的，要么是错误的。

If you keep making decisions without using data and  experimentation, you will be lucky or wrong.

如果你一直不使用数据和实验来做决定，那么你将是幸运的还是错误的。

This is a huge problem.

这是个大问题。

If you kind  of get to a scale of Airbnb or something even smaller than that, then every  decision you're going to make that you don't use A/B testing for, you won't actually  know what the full, true outcome of that decision might be.

如果你达到了Airbnb的规模，或者比它更小的东西，那么你要做的每一个不使用A/B测试的决定，你都不会知道这个决定的全部、真正的结果可能是什么。

At Airbnb, we use  experimentation and A?B testing for every single major decision in the entire company.

在Airbnb，我们用实验和A？对整个公司的每一个重大决策进行测试。

This is  how that tool worked at Airbnb.

这就是这个工具在Airbnb的运作方式。

I'm going to talk sort of like more about  how that looked like.

我会更多地谈谈那是什么样子。

Let's say in your company, you decide to ship a feature.

比方说，在你的公司里，你决定发布一个功能。

 This is how many measurements of that metric per day and the Wednesday here is  when I ship them in the future.

这是每天测量这个指标的数量，而周三是我将来装运它们的时候。

They'll look at it two weeks later, and  it looks at that, the metric of that feature went up, so it's a good  thing, right? Well, it's not that easy because there are so many more different factors.

两周后，他们会再看一看，这个特征的度量值上升了，所以这是件好事，对吧？嗯，这并不容易，因为还有很多不同的因素。

 Who knows what happened between here? If you're a soccer app and the World Cup  just started, well, then, you wouldn't know if the features had made a difference.

谁知道这之间发生了什么？如果你是一个足球应用程序，世界杯刚刚开始，那么，你就不会知道这些功能是否起了作用。

If  this was just peak season of whatever you're doing, this is a school app, education  app, and this is September, then you wouldn't know either.

如果这只是你正在做的事情的高峰期，这是一个学校应用，教育应用，而这是九月，那么你也不会知道。

So the only way you  would know is what's called a counterfactual.

所以你唯一知道的方法就是所谓的反事实。

Basically an A/B test.

基本上是A/B测试。

By running two different  versions of the same feature, the same site, the same time, you would be able  to know what the true difference between making this decisions and not making it was.

通过运行相同功能的两个不同版本，相同的站点，同时，您将能够知道做这个决定和不做决定之间的真正区别。

 This might sounds a bit technical, but it's very, very important to internalize because you  will get to a point where you were successful up until that point and you  think that you are so good at making these decisions, and then they get harder  to make.

这听起来可能有点技术性，但内化是非常重要的，因为在那之前，你会成功，你认为你很擅长做这些决定，然后他们就变得更难做了。

You have to have a framework to make these decisions.

你必须有一个框架来做出这些决定。

Because this is  so important at Airbnb, we built something we call experiminterview.

因为这在Airbnb非常重要，所以我们建立了一个我们称之为“实验访谈”的项目。

Experiminterview is when the whole  growth team would meet in a room like this, would go through all the features  that we had recently built, and before we told you which of the different features  in the experiment that actually won, we'd ask the audience.

专家访谈是指当整个成长团队在这样一个房间里会面时，我们会浏览我们最近建造的所有功能，在我们告诉你实验中哪些不同的特征真正获胜之前，我们会询问观众。

So I'm going to do  that with you guys here.

所以我要和你们一起做这件事。

Here's a photo of a experiminterview.

这是一张实验采访的照片。

We would do this  every two or three weeks.

我们会每两三个星期做一次。

It's really fun.

真的很有趣。

But it drove home this one thing,  which is that making product decisions are really hard.

但这让我们明白了一件事，那就是做产品决策真的很难。

All right.

好的

Let's get started.

我们开始吧

The  goal of this product was to increase the number of shares from the Airbnb mobile  app, specifically the number of shares of listings.

该产品的目标是增加Airbnb移动应用程序的股票数量，特别是上市股票的数量。

Back at that time, we had two  options.

当时我们有两种选择。

We had the native share sheet that you'll know about, and then we have  this experiment share sheet, which take up the entire screen and has more colors.

我们有一个本地的分享表，你会知道，然后我们有了这个实验分享板，它占据了整个屏幕，有更多的颜色。

The  same type of buttons, sort of.

同样类型的按钮，差不多。

You can see the difference here.

你可以在这里看到不同之处。

Now, before I  show the answer, how many here think that the native share sheet led to more  shares? Raise your hand.

现在，在我给出答案之前，这里有多少人认为本地股票表导致了更多的股票？举起你的手。

It's about half the room.

差不多半个房间。

How many here thought that the  new share sheet that one of our engineers built drove more shares? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为，我们的一位工程师建造的新股票表推动了更多的股票？举起你的手。

 So many hands did not raise.

这么多人没有举手。

I'm assuming you guys think there was no difference.

我猜你们觉得没什么区别。

 Because this is so hard, you have to make a decision.

因为这太难了，你得做个决定。

You have to make  a decision.

你得做个决定。

You have to have an opinion.

你得有自己的意见。

If you don't have an opinion here,  you're basically saying, "I can't decide," so.

如果你在这里没有意见，你基本上是在说，“我不能决定，”所以。

This share sheet led to 40% more shares.

这份股票表导致更多40%的股份。

 It's very important in this case that we use experimentation because if we had just  gone by our gut, we would've been wrong.

在这种情况下，我们使用实验是非常重要的，因为如果我们只是凭直觉行事，我们就错了。

Half of the room, more than half  of the room would've been wrong.

一半的房间，一半以上的房间都是错的。

Let's do one more.

再来一次。

So we sent out this  email to existing users of Airbnb to sort of ...

所以我们发了这封邮件给Airbnb的现有用户

When I would make a  booking at Airbnb, we sent out this email to the people that I listed as  my co-travelers, and the email will look in the control like this, where it would  have the itinerary, the address to that listing, and the button on that email would  say, "Join Gustaf's trip." Now we tried a new version where the email looked a  little bit different, less content, and then we have a different button here called "Accept  Gustaf's trip invitation." The goal here was to get signups, so people have to click  on this button, and then sign up.

当我在Airbnb订票的时候，我们把这封电子邮件发给了我列出的人，我把这些人列为我的共同旅行者，这封电子邮件看起来就像这样，上面有行程，地址，以及邮件上的按钮，上面写着“加入古斯塔夫之旅”。现在，我们尝试了一个新的版本，其中的电子邮件看起来有点不同，内容较少，然后我们有一个不同的按钮，这里称为“接受古斯塔夫的旅行邀请”。这里的目标是获得注册，所以人们必须点击这个按钮，然后注册。

How many here think that "Join Gustaf's trip"  in the control led to more signups? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为“加入古斯塔夫之旅”会导致更多的注册？举起你的手。

Some people.

有些人。

How many here  think that "Accept Gustaf's trip invitation"? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为“接受古斯塔夫的旅行邀请”？举起你的手。

That's good.

那很好。

How many here think  that there was no difference? So this is a 14% increase of just changing the,  basically name of the button.

这里有多少人认为没有区别？因此，这是一个14%的增长只是改变，基本上名称的按钮。

Let's try one more for simplicity.

让我们再试一次，以求简单。

In this case, now  they're sharing experiments.

在这种情况下，现在他们正在分享实验。

I'm kind of giving you the very easy-to-understand ones.

我给你的是很容易理解的。

The control here  was sort of like a bunch of sharing options on the Airbnb listing.

这里的控制有点像Airbnb清单上的一堆共享选项。

We had  some Twitter icons, the Facebook icons, the email icons.

我们有一些Twitter图标，Facebook图标，电子邮件图标。

We had another version of that,  which the icons were round.

我们有另一个版本，图标是圆形的。

And then we have one that was called, sort of  square buttons, and it was just displaying email and Facebook, and then they can click  on more.

然后我们有一个叫做方形按钮的按钮，它只是显示电子邮件和Facebook，然后他们可以点击更多。

How many here thought, if the goal was sharing ,that the control with  the icons won? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为，如果目标是共享的话，有图标的控制就赢了？举起你的手。

Some people.

有些人。

How many here thought that the round  buttons were better? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为圆形按钮更好？举起你的手。

Some people.

有些人。

How many thought the square buttons? Wow.

有多少人认为方形按钮？哇

 You guys are really good.

你们真的很棒。

How many thought there was no difference? Well, both of  these were winners.

有多少人认为没有区别？这两个人都是赢家。

This was, by far, the biggest winner.

到目前为止，这是最大的赢家。

These are the kind of  things that we debated, and because we run experiments, you don't have to debate anymore.

这些都是我们讨论过的事情，因为我们做实验，你就不用再争论了。

 Product decisions are really hard.

产品决策真的很难。

At scale, you want to use experimentation, A/B testing to  make these decisions because otherwise, it'll be loudest voice in the room, they'll make decisions,  and you don't want that.

在规模上，你想要使用实验，A/B测试来做这些决定，否则，它将是房间里最响亮的声音，他们会做出决定，而你不想那样。

To summary sort of my talk, if you're running a  startup, you should be thinking about growth.

总结一下我的演讲，如果你在经营一家初创公司，你应该考虑成长。

Before you start working on growth tactics, you  should be measuring your retention and knowing if people are using, repeatedly using your product.

在你开始研究成长策略之前，你应该衡量你的保留度，并且知道人们是否在使用你的产品，反复使用你的产品。

 You should pick a metric and then pick a goal for that metric and drive  that metric towards that goal.

您应该选择一个度量，然后为该度量选择一个目标，并将该度量推向该目标。

Very simple.

很简单。

And then eventually, but not right away, you  should start running A/B tests for decisions that are hard to make.

最后，但不是马上，你应该开始对很难做出的决定进行A/B测试。

In the early  days, decisions are not that hard to make because they might be obvious, but the  moment they're not easy anymore, you should be doing this with experimentation.

在早期，做决定并不难，因为它们可能是显而易见的，但是当它们不再容易的时候，你应该用实验来做这件事。

Thank you.

谢谢。

I  think we have time for a couple of questions.

我想我们还有时间问几个问题。

Yes.

是

Audience: You said that experimentation is important for SEO.

观众：你说过实验对SEO很重要。

Do you have any frameworks or ways  you would think about trying experiments beyond just doing something randomly and then testing it  with A/B testing.

你有没有任何框架或方法，你会考虑尝试实验，而不仅仅是随机地做一些事情，然后用A/B测试来测试它。

Gustaf A.: So the question was around experimentation and SEO.

古斯塔夫答：所以问题是围绕实验和SEO。

How do you go about doing that?  When you run an on-page experiment, what you're trying to test is the amount of  organic traffic you get from Google and how your ranking shifts.

你要怎么做呢？当你在页面上进行一个实验时，你想要测试的是你从谷歌获得的有机流量以及你的排名是如何变化的。

Google actually are changing  the rankings all the time, so if you make a big change on your website,  on say half ...

谷歌实际上一直在改变排名，所以如果你在你的网站上做了很大的改变，比如说一半.

Let's say, let's call you have for Airbnb's case, listing pages  ...

比如说，给Airbnb的案子打电话，列出几页.

Sorry.

抱歉的

Search results pages.

搜索结果页面。

So Stockholm, London, San Francisco, we [inaudible] one group, and  then you have New York, Paris, and Barcelona be another group.

因此，斯德哥尔摩，伦敦，旧金山，我们(听不见)一组，然后你有纽约，巴黎和巴塞罗那是另一组。

You would change the  content on the first group of pages, but not the others.

您将更改第一组页面上的内容，而不是其他页面上的内容。

Within not too long  of a time, you would see more or less traffic going to either of these  groups from Google.

在不太长的时间内，你会看到或多或少的流量从谷歌流向这两个群体中的任何一个。

Sometimes, there's no difference, but if there is a difference, you'll see  more traffic.

有时，没有差别，但如果有不同，你会看到更多的流量。

I'll give you an idea of a very small change you could make.

我会给你一个关于你可以做的很小的改变的想法。

 Let's, for example, change the title tag from "Airbnb listings" to "The 25 Top Best  Listings in Barcelona." One of them is going to rank better because it's going to  be more inviting to click on, and then you run that experiment towards the search  engine, and then the search engine will kind of tell you which one is better  based on the amount of traffic on the search engine that you get.

例如，让我们将标题标签从“Airbnb列表”更改为“巴塞罗那25项最佳列表”。其中一个会排名更好，因为点击会更吸引人，然后你对搜索引擎进行实验，然后搜索引擎会根据你在搜索引擎上的流量来告诉你哪一个更好。

Yes.

是

Audience: Let's say that we're totally bought in on the [inaudible] of A/B testing but are  very early-stage startup that like we don't have enough traffic.

观众：假设我们完全接受A/B测试的(听不见的)，但是非常早期的创业，就像我们没有足够的流量。

This is something that our  team debates is we want to A/B test, but it feels like it's not worth  the effort because the results would not be reliable.

这是我们团队争论的问题，我们想要进行A/B测试，但这感觉不值得付出努力，因为结果是不可靠的。

How do you, what guidance do  you have for navigating that transition.

你是怎么做的，你有什么指引来引导这个转变。

Gustaf A.: So the question was around A/B testing.

古斯塔夫答：所以问题是关于A/B测试。

How do I determine if it's right for  me when I'm really early? So A/B testing is a function of change, so you  can have a medium to small-size audience.

当我真的早到的时候，我该如何确定它对我是否合适？所以A/B测试是一个变化的函数，所以你可以有一个中小型的观众。

If the change is large enough, is actually  can be significant.

如果变化足够大，实际上是很重要的。

The numbers can be significant.

数字可能很重要。

Now, what you can do is you  go do, you can go to Google and type in A/B testing calculator.

现在，你能做的就是去做，你可以去谷歌，输入A/B测试计算器。

There's a  form will pop up, and you can type in the metric that you have, and  then the change.

会弹出一个表单，您可以输入您所拥有的度量，然后进行更改。

You could see how big the change have to be for you  to be able to see a difference.

你可以看到改变有多大，你才能看到不同之处。

Now, if you're really, really small, you probably  shouldn't be doing A/B testing at all, so I would do A/B testing when you  have like enough traffic that you can see a medium to small-size change within, say,  two or three weeks.

现在，如果你真的，真的很小，你可能根本不应该做A/B测试，所以我会做A/B测试，当你有足够的流量，你可以看到一个中小型的变化，比如说，两到三个星期内。

So I'd say a small change would be a couple of  percent.

所以我想说，一个小的变化将是几个百分点。

If you can see that in a couple of weeks, kind of like that's  sort of the level you could be at.

如果你能在几周内看到这一点，就像你可能达到的水平一样。

That's probably my general recommendation.

这可能是我的一般性建议。

I've certainly  seen a lot of companies that are early, embracing A/B testing relatively early, and then  have that guide their decision-making.

我当然见过很多公司都很早就开始接受A/B测试，然后让它指导他们的决策。

I don't think that's a bad idea because I think  that's much ...

我不认为这是个坏主意，因为我觉得那太.

It's better to start a little bit early than to start way  too late.

早一点开始总比开始得太晚好。

If those are the only two options.

如果这是唯一的两个选择。

Of course, you start at the  right time.

当然，你从正确的时间开始。

Yep.

是的。

Audience: How [inaudible] see growth in maybe high-barrier entry markets like health insurance.

观众：在像医疗保险这样的高门槛进入市场，(听不见)是如何看待增长的。

Gustaf A.: How do apply growth to high-barrier entry market like health insurance? So I think you  should separate the acceleration of your growth in that market and the market itself.

古斯塔夫答：像健康保险这样的高门槛进入市场是如何实现增长的？所以我认为你应该把你在这个市场和市场本身的增长速度分开。

If  it's hard to reach people, that means you have to probably try to reach a  lot more people before you actually get sort of a ...

如果很难接触到人，那就意味着你必须尝试接触更多的人，然后你才能真正得到一种.

If a high ...

如果一个高.。

 Tell me what you mean by a high barrier.

告诉我你所说的高门槛是什么意思。

Audience: Well, for example, there's a bit, with insurance, you have to do risk sharing, right?  And you have to have to a lot people [inaudible] in order for one person  to want to buy your product because it's kind of this [inaudible] but there's also  a pile of regulation and [inaudible] on top of it.

观众：嗯，例如，有一点，对于保险，你必须做风险分担，对吗？为了让一个人想买你的产品，你必须有很多人(听不见)，因为它是这样的(听不见的)，但是在它上面还有一堆规则和(听不到的)。

Gustaf A.: Yeah, so if you have a risk and regulation involved, I don't think that the  principle of growth changes, but if you're purely growing through sales, for example, you can  apply a lot of automation and technology to how to do sales.

古斯塔夫答：是的，如果你有风险和监管，我不认为增长的原则会改变，但是如果你仅仅是通过销售来增长，你可以用很多自动化和技术来做销售。

If I'm a  company and I'm selling to insurance buyers at startups, I might be starting by emailing  10 people.

如果我是一家公司，并且在初创公司向保险买家销售，我可能会通过发电子邮件给10个人开始。

In fact, I can email 100 people or 1,000 people with the same  type of level of ...

事实上，我可以用电子邮件给100个人或1000人发电子邮件.

The email itself is kind of viewed as personal and  as direct to that receiver as if I send one email that I just wrote  myself.

这封电子邮件本身被认为是个人的，并且是直接发送给那个接收者的，就好像我刚写了一封我自己写的电子邮件一样。

There's certainly things that you can apply to your growth that allows you to  reach a lot more people.

当然，有一些东西你可以应用到你的成长中，让你接触到更多的人。

Now, growth doesn't solve any of their risk challenges at  all.

现在，增长根本解决不了它们面临的任何风险挑战。

It doesn't solve any kind of major market issues.

它不能解决任何主要的市场问题。

Airbnb certainly had a lot  issues with legal challenges in different markets, and so the growth was disconnected from that.

Airbnb在不同市场的法律挑战肯定存在很多问题，因此增长与之脱节。

 That wasn't sort of our goal.

这不是我们的目标。

If you're a startup that have those problems, I  don't think you should solve them ...

如果你是一家有这些问题的初创公司，我认为你不应该解决这些问题.

Solving them and solving growth are two different  things.

解决它们和解决增长是两件不同的事情。

They are very different from each other.

他们彼此很不一样。

Growth is a way to accelerate you  getting to more health insurance buyers.

增长是一种加速你获得更多健康保险买家的方法。

It doesn't actually say anything whether that's a good  thing or a bad thing.

不管这是好事还是坏事，它都不会说什么。

Yeah.

嗯

Audience: Do you have any wisdom on using non-sustainable tactics [inaudible] market like Uber.

观众：你对使用像优步这样的不可持续的策略有什么智慧吗？

Gustaf A.: Do I have any wisdom of using non-sustainable tactics in new market like Uber? So  if you're doing things that don't scale, you sort of have two options.

古斯塔夫答：在像优步这样的新市场上使用不可持续的策略，我有什么智慧吗？所以，如果你做的事情没有规模，你有两个选择。

One is  they don't scale, so you should stop doing them eventually.

第一，他们没有规模，所以你应该停止他们最终。

Or you build a playbook  where you take those skills and kind of try them in a different city.

或者你制作了一本剧本，在那里你学到了这些技能，并在不同的城市尝试它们。

Now,  they might not eventually scale, so let's say I am out manually to recruit Uber  drivers.

现在，他们可能最终不会扩大规模，所以假设我是手动招聘优步司机。

Now that might be an unsustainable growth tactic.

现在，这可能是一种不可持续的增长策略。

It might be working for the  first 20 drivers, but eventually, it's not going to have high ROI in comparison to  say running ads on Facebook to recruit drivers.

它可能适用于前20名司机，但最终，与Facebook上的招聘司机相比，它不会有很高的投资回报率。

I think you kind of have to  determine this manual thing that I'm doing in the very beginning, which is doing things  that don't scale, which is recruiting every single user to become a user of your  product, eventually won't work anymore, and you kind of have to find another channel, or  it won't be high ROI in comparison to the other channels.

我认为你必须确定我刚开始做的手工操作，那就是做一些没有规模的事情，招募每一个用户成为你产品的用户，最终你就不能再工作了，你必须找到另一个渠道，否则它就不会比其他频道更高的投资回报率了。

Most companies will go  through this transition period where you grow from, say, writing content manually to through engineering,  changing your website so that you get more search traffic, for example.

例如，大多数公司都会经历这样的过渡时期，比如，你会从手工编写内容到通过工程，改变你的网站，从而获得更多的搜索流量。

Audience: What about how they're doing lots of subsidies for rides.

观众：他们是如何为乘车提供大量补贴的呢？

Gustaf A.: What about doing subsidies or incentives for rides? Well, I actually think the incentives are  super scalable.

古斯塔夫答：对乘车提供补贴或奖励如何？好吧，我认为激励措施是超级可扩展的。

Like at Airbnb, we still have the referral program.

就像Airbnb一样，我们还有转诊计划。

They're signing up, I  don't know hundreds of thousands of users every day almost, which, and large portion of  them are signing up through referrals, so that is an example where subsidies are actually  scalable.

他们注册了，我不知道几乎每天都有成千上万的用户，他们中的很大一部分是通过推荐注册的，所以这是一个补贴实际上是可扩展的例子。

Now, me handing you a coupon in your hand is not scalable, but doing  that through an email system what through Whatapp or through Messenger or some other channel,  is actually scalable as long as you're not losing the money.

现在，我给你一张优惠券不是可扩展的，但是通过电子邮件系统-通过Whatapp、Messenger或其他渠道-实际上是可扩展的，只要你不亏钱。

You have to have  a very good ROI calculation on the money that you're handing out and knowing that  that's incremental money that if you didn't give that money, those users wouldn't actually start  using your product.

你必须对你发放的钱有一个非常好的ROI计算，并且知道这是增量的钱，如果你不给钱，那些用户就不会真正开始使用你的产品。

So as long as you have a good handle on that, that  is totally fine.

所以只要你有一个好的处理，这是完全好的。

Yes.

是

Audience: We talked a lot about product marketing being [inaudible] mentioned that you have to achieve  that before you really invest in growth, so my [inaudible] an app where we have  3% of our users are paying for the premium features, but the other 97% are  using the free features, but [inaudible] of those guys are using it more than two  hours a day, so they really like those free features, [inaudible] aren't willing to pay  for the premium features.

观众：我们讨论了很多关于产品营销的话题，提到在你真正投资于增长之前，你必须做到这一点，所以我的应用程序中，我们有3%的用户在付费，而其他97%的用户在使用免费功能，但这些人每天都在使用超过两个小时的功能，所以他们每天都在使用它。真的很喜欢那些免费的功能，(听不到)不愿意支付额外的功能。

So how much of, like before we invest in that growth,  I guess how do we find what those free ...

那么，在我们对增长进行投资之前，我想我们应该如何找到那些免费的.

[inaudible] be could still achieve  [inaudible] growth.

[听不见的]仍能达到[听不到]增长。

Gustaf A.: The question was around they have two groups of users: the free users and then  the paying users, and some of them are very active, and some of them are  not as active, but at least they don't want to pay, how would use growth  there? One of the things I would try to figure out is what is the  retention rate of those paying users? Are they actually sticking around and using the product  that they're paying for? What's the retention rate for the free users? Do that change  once they start paying? And then I will look at conversions or like how, what  percentage of the free users am I converting to paid? There's many different ways to  that.

古斯塔夫答：问题是他们有两组用户：免费用户，然后是付费用户，其中一些人非常活跃，有些人不那么活跃，但至少他们不想付费，他们如何利用那里的增长呢？我想弄清楚的一件事是，付费用户的保留率是多少？他们是否真的留下来使用他们花钱买的产品？免费用户的保留率是多少？一旦他们开始付钱就会改变吗？然后，我将看看转换或喜欢，如何，我转换为付费的免费用户的百分比？要做到这一点有很多不同的方法。

There's one, which is having the freeman concept.

有一个，它有弗里曼的概念。

You can also have a free  trail, which means you actually don't have freemen.

你也可以有一条自由之路，这意味着你实际上没有自由人。

You can just have a very limited  set of free users, and then they kind of have to go to paid.

你可以有一组非常有限的免费用户，然后他们就不得不付费了。

But  ultimately, to the extent that you should be growing all of this, comes down to  how much usage you have from these, the users that you value.

但从根本上说，你应该在多大程度上发展这一切，这取决于你对这些用户的使用程度，以及你所看重的用户。

If the paid  users are the one you value the most, if they stop using your product after  three months, then you have a more fundamental problem than the conversation between these two  groups.

如果付费用户是您最看重的用户，如果他们在三个月后停止使用您的产品，那么您有一个比这两组之间的对话更根本的问题。

So I would still go back to retention and look at usage for these  people and see: are they actually sticking around and using the product? Last question from  over here.

因此，我仍然会回到保留状态，看看这些人的用法，看看他们是否真的坚持使用该产品？最后一个问题。

Yes, in the back.

是的，在后面。

Audience: The only question I have a friend who is the head of the product growth  involved in a startup, and I was a little taken aback when this person told  me that experimentation is actually really hard for them.

观众：我唯一的问题是，我有一个朋友，他是一家初创公司产品成长的主管，当这个人告诉我实验对他们来说真的很难时，我有点吃惊。

Is there an ideal or a  healthy frequency for experimentation.

是否有理想的或健康的实验频率。

Gustaf A.: So the question is sometimes experimentation can be really hard to execute.

古斯塔夫答：所以问题是，有时候实验真的很难执行。

Is there an  ideal frequency or which experiment should I be actually be running? For something like a  marketplace, experimentation is really hard.

是否有一个理想的频率，或我应该实际运行的哪个实验？对于一个市场来说，实验是非常困难的。

That is correct.

这是正确的。

In that case, it's harder than just  setting up a simple tool online or using Mixpanel to set up your simple A/B  test.

在这种情况下，它比仅仅设置一个简单的工具在线或使用MixPanel设置您的简单A/B测试更困难。

It's more difficult than that.

比那更难。

If you are having a simple product funnel, it's  generally not that hard to set up experimentation if you have an engineer and if  you have a decent amount of traffic.

如果你有一个简单的产品漏斗，如果你有一个工程师，如果你有一个不错的流量，那通常很容易进行实验。

It's not that hard to set it up.

设置它并不难。

 Now, there is different kind of products that make experimentation harder.

现在，有不同类型的产品使实验变得更加困难。

I think that if  you're at the stage where you have a lot traffic, in my opinion, you don't  have really an option.

我认为如果你处于交通拥堵的阶段，在我看来，你没有选择的余地。

You sort of have to invest in some level infrastructure to  use data to make decisions.

在某种程度上，您必须投资于某种级别的基础设施，才能使用数据进行决策。

If you don't do that, the alternative cost is you  end up making a lot of bad decision or either long or they're lucky.

如果你不这样做，另一种代价是你最终做出了很多糟糕的决定，要么很长，要么他们很幸运。

You're  lucky because they're right or you're wrong.

你很幸运因为他们是对的还是你错了。

So you don't really have an option, but  you run experiments.

所以你真的没有选择，但你做实验。

It is true that there is some type of product through which  experimentation is easy.

的确，有某种类型的产品可以很容易地进行实验。

If you're running a mobile app, experimentation is not that difficult.

如果你在运行一个移动应用程序，实验并不是那么困难。

There  are lots of tools you can use to run experimentations.

有很多工具可以用来运行实验。

If you're running out of  ideas for experiments, well, you should go back to user research and you should look  at other products that are ...

如果你没有做实验的想法，那么，你应该回到用户的研究中去，你应该看看其他的产品。

Look at something like Pinterest or Airbnb or Facebook,  they're probably highly optimized, so a lot of the things in their funnels is there  for a very specific reasons because of A/B testing.

看看Pinterest、Airbnb或Facebook之类的东西，它们可能是高度优化的，因此，由于A/B测试的原因，漏斗中的很多东西都在那里。

I don't have a better answer  than if you don't do it, you'll have a lot of other problems.

我没有比你不这样做更好的答案，你会有很多其他的问题。

In terms  of the frequency, there is a cost to setting up an experiment, and that cost  should be minimized as much as possible.

就频率而言，建立一个实验是有代价的，这种成本应该尽可能地最小化。

But it's sort of like you should try  to get better at it and pick the easiest, smallest thing that you can test,  and just test that.

但这有点像你应该试着做得更好，选择你能测试的最简单、最小的东西，然后测试它。

If you have a big new feature you want to test,  well, just test the first part of that feature.

如果您有一个想要测试的新特性，那么只需测试该特性的第一部分。

Don't test all of it, and  see how people react to the first part of the feature.

不要全部测试，看看人们对第一部分特性的反应。

I can talk for  hours about this, but thank you very much.

我可以谈上几个小时，但是非常感谢你。

(silence).


(沉默)。
