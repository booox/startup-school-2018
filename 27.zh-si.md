Geoff Ralston: The next speaker, Daniel Gross, is a former YC founder, and YC partner, and he  is going to tell you some really important things about staying sane and healthy and  whole while you're doing this incredibly hard thing that is being a startup founder. So,  Daniel.

Geoff Ralston:下一位演讲者，丹尼尔·格罗斯，是YC的前创始人，也是YC的合伙人，他会告诉你一些非常重要的事情，在你做这件非常艰难的事情时，你要保持理智、健康和完整。丹尼尔。

Daniel Gross: Thank you.

Daniel Gross:谢谢。

Thank you, Jeff.

谢谢杰夫。

Alright, hello. Sorry, we're running a little behind today. It's  my fault. If any of you are working on curing traffic, I suggest you get  to it a little bit faster. So this was the original title of the talk.  In hindsight, it's kind of a terrible title, so we're gonna remove it.

好吧，你好。抱歉，我们今天有点落后。是我的错。如果你们中的任何一个人都在努力解决交通问题，我建议你们再快一点。这是演讲的最初标题。事后看来，这是个糟糕的标题，所以我们要删除它。

This is  actually what I want to talk about today. I think everyone here, fundamentally, is playing  a game, and you want to win that game. Whatever project you're working on, I'm  sure people here are excited to build the next empire, become the next Rockefellers.

这就是我今天要谈的。我认为，从根本上说，这里的每个人都在玩一场游戏，而你想要赢得这场比赛。不管你在做什么项目，我相信这里的人都会为建立下一个帝国而兴奋，成为下一个洛克菲勒人。

And  one kind of view here that I've noticed over years of working with different startup  founders, being a startup founder myself is, when you're a founder, the mentality you get  into is kind of like you're an athlete.

我在这里注意到的一种观点是，多年来我一直在与不同的初创公司创始人合作，作为一个创业公司的创始人，当你是一名创始人时，你的心态就好像你是一名运动员。

And startups are kind of the Olympics.  It's one of the hardest things you can do.

初创公司就像是奥运会。这是你能做的最难的事情之一。

And what I'd like to do  in this talk today is go over some of the mistakes some novice athletes make  while they're trying to play in the Olympics, because I do think they're kind of  repeated.

在今天的演讲中，我想说的是一些新手运动员在试图参加奥运会时所犯的错误，因为我认为这些错误是重复的。

And over the course of the past few weeks, I think you guys have  seen great talks on mistakes people make, say, when marketing, or hiring, or growing your  company. But there's a lot of mistakes you make with yourself.

在过去的几周里，我想你们已经看到了关于人们在市场营销、招聘或发展公司时所犯的错误的很好的谈话。但你自己犯了很多错误。

And I'd like to  help you potentially avoid them.

我想帮你避免它们。

A lot of the mistakes stem from this recurring theme,  which is, you're working really hard, and not smart. Kind of like this guy, with  the rickshaw. You don't want to be in this position. Examples of things that will  be in your head if you start a company, especially as you start growing out  a team, are I'm gonna be in the office all the time. Or I will  make sure to be the last one out today. I will work as hard as  I can.

很多错误都源于这个反复出现的主题，那就是，你在努力工作，而不是聪明。就像这个人，和人力车一样。你不想处于这样的境地。如果你创办了一家公司，尤其是当你开始成长为一个团队的时候，你会想到的例子是，我会一直呆在办公室里。否则我肯定会是今天最后一个出来的。我将尽我所能努力工作。

And while there's a lot of value in it, that stuff could kind  of go wrong, because ultimately, input doesn't equal output. Founders seem to make this mistake  over and over again, and what they forget is, nobody wants to work for a  tired idiot. It's actually incredibly uninspiring.

虽然它有很大的价值，但这些东西可能会出错，因为最终，投入并不等于输出。创始人似乎一次又一次地犯了这个错误，而他们忘记的是，没有人愿意为一个疲惫的白痴工作。这实际上是令人难以置信的不鼓舞人心的。

And so, ultimately, if we were to do a  little quick Harvard two by two metrics here, if you just ...

所以，最后，如果我们能快速完成哈佛大学的测试，如果你.

This is the  most common startup founder mistake, where you just focus on, I'm gonna pedal the bike  as hard as possible, and you don't really get anywhere.

这是最常见的初创公司创始人的错误，在这里，你只是专注于，我将尽可能地骑自行车，而你却什么也没有得到。

That's kind of bad, too.  I would not want the outcome of this talk to be the other extreme, which  is maybe, you could define academia and get really smart, but you're not pedaling as  hard. What you really want is to be doing both.

这也很糟糕。我不希望这次演讲的结果是另一个极端，也许，你可以给学术界下定义，变得很聪明，但你并没有那么努力。你真正想要的是两者兼得。

And so, we're gonna be  talking a little bit today on how to do that. Before we dig into any  details, I thought it should be interesting to maybe quickly go over why this even  happens as a problem. So out of curiosity, if you've ever worked for someone before  that you respected, a manager you respected, please raise your hand. Okay, so about half  the room. Ultimately, when you're a founder, you kind of want to win the approval  of your pack, be it your team, or other founders.

所以，我们今天要讨论一下如何做到这一点。在我们深入研究任何细节之前，我想也许快速地研究一下为什么会发生这样的问题是很有趣的。所以出于好奇，如果你曾经为一个你尊敬的人工作过，一个你尊敬的经理，请举手。好吧，差不多半个房间。最终，当你是一个创始人的时候，你想要赢得你的团队的认可，不管是你的团队，还是其他的创始人。

And the problem is, a  lot of first time founders don't really have that experience of what that thing you  want to look up to is. So they don't have a mental model for what  to emulate.

问题是，很多第一次创业的人并没有真正体验到你想要仰慕的东西是什么。所以他们没有什么可以模仿的心理模型。

And as a result, there's just a lot of common mistakes people make,  because they don't know kind of what greatness looks like, and so they optimize for  the wrong thing.

结果，人们犯了很多常见的错误，因为他们不知道什么是伟大，所以他们优化了错误的东西。

Alright, so that should set, hopefully, the general framing for the talk.  What does this actually mean in practice? So we're gonna go over a couple of  different areas. Common mistake with sleep, food, exercise, your mind, and leadership.

好吧，所以这应该是，希望，总体框架的讨论。这实际上意味着什么呢？所以我们要穿越几个不同的区域。睡眠、食物、锻炼、思维和领导能力都是常见的错误。

This is kind  of a Maslow's hierarchy of sorts to startup success, where I think you can only  tackle the stuff at the bottom after you tackle the basics. What's really ironic about  the advice I'm about to deliver you, is I'm sure for about half the people  in this room, and I'm sure many more people online, you will make all these  mistakes despite me saying what I'm about to say. It's kind of fascinating, but I'll  go through the exercise anyway, just so I can tell you I told you so.  Alright, so sleep. Guys, the reviews are in. Sleep is the ultimate nootropic. It just  takes a couple of hours to apply.

这是马斯洛对创业成功的一种等级结构，我认为只有在你完成了基础工作之后，你才能从底层解决这些问题。我要给你们的建议最具讽刺意味的是，我确信这间屋子里大约有一半的人，而且我相信更多的人在网上，你会犯所有这些错误，尽管我要说的是我要说的话。这很吸引人，但无论如何我还是要做这个练习，这样我就可以告诉你我告诉过你了。好吧，那就睡吧。伙计们评论出来了。睡眠是终极的迷向性。申请只需要几个小时。

There is no way that cutting that hour  of sleep was actually worth it for your company, unless there's a real emergency. Some  people need five hours of sleep, some people need eight hours of sleep, some people  need nine. Just sleep as much as you need. When I started my first company,  I was very focused on, as I mentioned earlier, just being in the office all  the time, working as hard as possible, and again, it's really stupid, and in fact,  bad for your shareholders and for your entire company if you're coming in there with  20% cognition 'cause you're not sleeping well. I would spend a bunch of weekend time,  you don't have to spend your company time on this, optimizing your sleep environment. I  think sleep masks are the most underrated product in the world, in terms of the  upside that they give you and the cost is like $20. I sleep significantly better.  There's a website for this that details it. I would just go through all their  products. I would be incredibly frugal in general in life, and I would spend lavishly  on this one.

除非有真正的紧急情况，否则减少睡眠时间对你的公司来说是不值得的。有些人需要5小时的睡眠，有些人需要8小时的睡眠，有些人需要9小时的睡眠。你想睡多少就睡多久。当我开始我的第一家公司的时候，我非常专注于，就像我前面提到的，一直呆在办公室里，尽可能努力地工作。再说一遍，这真的很愚蠢，而且事实上，如果你来的时候有20%的认知，那对你的股东和整个公司都是不好的，因为你睡不好觉。我会花很多周末的时间，你不必把你的公司时间花在这上面，优化你的睡眠环境。我认为睡眠面膜是世界上最被低估的产品，从它们给你带来的好处来看，它的成本大概是20美元。我睡得更好。有一个网站可以详细介绍。我会检查他们所有的产品。在生活中，我会非常节俭，而且我会在这件事上大手大脚地花钱。

Again, just think about it as a nootropic. I know there's a  lot of people that are obsessed with kind of taking l'theanine, or caffeine.

再一次，把它想象成一个迷向。我知道有很多人痴迷于服用茶氨酸或咖啡因。

This is  a far better nootropic than all that stuff. So just spend on it. I would  try to avoid using an alarm clock, at least for half the week.

这比所有的东西都要好得多。所以就花在上面吧。我会尽量避免使用闹钟，至少一周的一半时间。

Again, your  ancestors didn't have an alarm clock.

再说一遍，你的祖先没有闹钟。

They survived, you should be able to as well.  Sometimes, one thing your ancestors obviously were not exposed to is a lot of light  in the night, and so occasionally, resetting your circadian rhythm, I think for a lot  of folks, especially software engineers, can be helpful. I think if you're a software engineer,  you probably have ... Well, I found at least, most software engineers that I've worked  with have about a 25 hour cycle.

他们活下来了，你也应该能活下来。有时候，你的祖先们显然没有接触到的一件事是夜间的大量光线，所以偶尔，重新设定你的昼夜节律，我认为对很多人来说，尤其是软件工程师，可能会有帮助。我想如果你是个软件工程师，你可能.嗯，我发现至少大多数和我一起工作过的软件工程师都有大约25小时的工作周期。

That is to say, they increasingly wake up  later and later and later. If you take a little bit of melatonin, you can  actually reset that quite well. For various fascinating regulation reasons, most melatonin sold in the  United States is way much more than you need. It's like three, five, or ten  milligrams. Your body makes point three when it wants to put you to bed, so  that's what you should take. You literally have to buy this on Amazon, the reasons  for which are fascinating, but outside of the context of this talk. Okay, so we  discussed sleep a little bit.

也就是说，他们越来越晚才醒来。如果你服用一点褪黑素，你实际上可以很好地重置它。由于各种各样迷人的监管原因，大多数在美国销售的褪黑素远远超过了你的需求。大概是三、五、十毫克。当你的身体想让你上床睡觉的时候，你的身体会产生第三点，所以这就是你应该吃的东西。你必须在亚马逊上买这个，其中的原因很吸引人，但却超出了这个话题的范围。好吧，我们讨论了一下睡眠问题。

That should be real basic. I don't think you should  tackle anything else before you're sleeping well. It's, again, fascinating. I'm sure most of you,  some of you will follow this advice.

这应该是非常基本的。我认为在你睡好之前，你不应该再做其他的事情了。又一次很吸引人。我相信你们中的大多数人会遵循这个建议。

A lot of you will continue doing what  you're doing. But again, I told you so.

你们中的很多人会继续做你们正在做的事情。但我跟你说过了。

Alright, let's talk about food. Okay, so  again, just think of what you're doing and what you want your team to be.  Garbage food impairs your judgment. I, at some point, realized I was letting everyone else  down on my team if I was not playing at peak performance, if I was  not treating myself like an athlete. So I would not eat crap food. I really  don't want to go down the rabbit hole of what diets to do. I'm not  a dietician, and I'm not here to be your Tony Robbins, but I would just  focus on whatever you think is healthy. I actually think there's probably a lot of  psychological benefit to just eating whatever you think is healthy. Frankly, if you believe sugar  is really healthy for you, if you really believe that, maybe that's fine. Whatever fad  you're into, just go for it.

好吧，让我们谈谈食物。好吧，再一次，想想你在做什么，你想让你的团队成为什么样的人。垃圾食品会损害你的判断力。在某种程度上，我意识到，如果我没有在表现最好的时候打球，如果我没有像对待运动员一样对待自己，我就会让我的球队里的其他人失望。这样我就不会吃垃圾食物了。我真的不想在兔子洞里吃些什么。我不是营养师，我也不是来做你的托尼·罗宾斯的，但我只想关注你认为健康的东西。事实上，我认为只要吃你认为健康的东西，就会有很多心理上的好处。坦率地说，如果你相信糖对你来说是健康的，如果你真的相信，也许这是好的。不管你喜欢什么时尚，都要努力。

This is something worth investing in.

这是值得投资的东西。

This is a  contentious topic, but I think it is immoral to have junk food, weaponized junk food,  in your office. I would just get rid of all of it, and focus on  healthy food. You can find healthy foods just as cheap. I also think everyone is  dehydrated all the time. I would try to drink an uncomfortable amount of water.

这是一个有争议的话题，但我认为在你的办公室里有垃圾食品，武器化的垃圾食品是不道德的。我会把所有的东西都扔掉，把注意力集中在健康的食物上。你可以找到同样便宜的健康食品。我也认为每个人都是脱水的。我会尝试喝一杯不舒服的水。

This  is probably the only weird hack I'm gonna give you in this talk. Most of  it's gonna be frameworks. But practically speaking, yes, you got it.

这可能是我在这次演讲中给你的唯一次奇怪的攻击。大部分都是框架。但实际上，是的，你明白了。

This man is set  up for success. I just think you'll feel much better if you do.

这个人注定要成功。我只是觉得如果你这么做你会感觉好多了。

Alright, so  that's a little bit about food.

好吧，这是关于食物的一点。

Again, I think it's pretty simple.

再说一次，我觉得很简单。

The message here,  the repeated message here is invest in yourself, because startups are one of the most  draining things you can do to your body, to your mind. Let's talk about exercise.  Okay, this is probably a good idea.

这里的信息，重复的信息是投资于你自己，因为创业是你能对你的身体、对你的头脑做的最令人疲惫的事情之一。我们来谈谈运动吧。好吧，这可能是个好主意。

Again, just like sleep, the results are pretty  conclusive on this one. One thing I always ... Well, taking a step back. If  you don't exercise, I would at least try to spend a lot of time outdoors.  If you have a team, you can start having one on ones outdoors if you're  managing that team. If you're somewhere terribly cold where you can't spend time outdoors, that  sucks, but well, maybe you should move to somewhere that has more sun. I would  always picture in my mind, 'cause I'm an overly competitive person, that whoever my competitor  was, they were probably working out like four times a week, becoming better, having better  ideas, becoming more creative. If that framing is helpful for you, I would use it.  I don't mean to be overly prescriptive on what you do. I think anything you  do in the spirit of exercise is good. I don't have to cite, I can't,  I don't have time to cite all the studies that correlate with this. I do  think running is probably the best, in terms of time expenditure to potential reward, if  you can do it.

再一次，就像睡眠一样，这一次的结果是非常有说服力的。有一件事我一直.。退一步。如果你不锻炼，我至少会试着花很多时间在户外。如果你有一个团队，你可以开始有一个一对一的户外，如果你管理的团队。如果你在寒冷的地方不能在户外消磨时间，那就太糟糕了，但是，也许你应该搬到阳光更多的地方去。我总是在脑海中想象，因为我是一个竞争过度的人，无论我的竞争对手是谁，他们可能每周锻炼四次，变得更好，有更好的想法，更有创造力。如果这个框架对你有帮助的话，我会用它。我不是想对你的工作过于规定性。我认为你在锻炼的精神中所做的任何事情都是好的。我不需要引用，我不能，我没有时间引用所有与此相关的研究。我确实认为跑步可能是最好的，如果你能做到的话，从时间花费到潜在的回报来看。

And I think the more interesting question with exercise is not  whether you should do it, 'cause I think it's pretty clear to everyone on the  planet you should do it, but how to convince yourself to do it, because that's  the harder psychological bit.

我认为运动更有趣的问题不是你是否应该做，因为我认为地球上的每个人都很清楚你应该这么做，而是如何说服自己去做，因为这在心理上是比较难的。

The largest mistake I think people make, especially if you're a  founder of a company, is you have a like, I'm gonna go all in mentality.  You tend to go all into things. If you go all into something like running  the first time, you're gonna hate it, 'cause you're gonna sprint. Sprinting sucks. So I  would not overdo it, and I would start really small, and build positive memories you  can grow on. So celebrate success. What you want to do is, pretty much for  everything, but in this particular thing, the trick is to create a positive memory such  that when your brain predicts whether you do that activity the next time, it look  back and thinks, yeah, that was kind of fun. So that may mean running a  mile, and then getting a frappuccino. Just because, what you'll remember is getting the frappuccino.  But try to really trick yourself into doing this. It'll definitely pay off. I think  the other thing you can do in order to kind of reduce to willpower required  to do anything is, surround yourself by other people that are doing it. You can  tell other people that you're running, which is great, 'cause then you'll kind of feel  like you have to do it, 'cause you told everyone about it. You could surround  yourself with other people that are running. For me, especially through the dark phases of  my startup, this was definitely my light. It helps you relax, it helps you focus,  and you guys are gonna go through a lot of ups and downs. I suggest  setting up these good habits while you're either at a plateau, or at an up,  because it's really hard to convince yourself to do anything while you're down. But if  you set up the mental habit, it's a little bit easier to come back to.  Alright, so if you got down the basics, you're sleeping well, you're eating well, you're  exercising, then we can start to talk about the more interesting things you could do  and you should be doing to transform yourself as a leader and to really take  your company to the next level.

我认为人们犯的最大错误，尤其是如果你是一家公司的创始人，就是你有相似之处，我会全力以赴。你总是全神贯注。如果你第一次跑的话，你会讨厌的，因为你要冲刺了。短跑糟透了。所以我不会做的太多，我会开始的很小，并建立积极的记忆，你可以成长。所以庆祝成功吧。你想要做的是，几乎所有的事情，但在这个特别的事情中，诀窍是创造一个积极的记忆，当你的大脑预测你是否在下一次做这个活动时，它会回头想，是的，这是一种乐趣。因此，这可能意味着跑一英里，然后得到一个弗拉普奇诺。就因为，你会记得的是得到了弗拉普奇诺。但是试着欺骗自己去做这件事。肯定会有回报的。我认为你可以做的另一件事，就是让其他人围绕着你去做任何事情，从而降低你做任何事情所需要的意志力。你可以告诉别人你在跑步，这很好，因为这样你就会觉得你必须这样做，因为你告诉了每个人。你可以和其他跑步的人围在一起。对我来说，尤其是在我创业的黑暗阶段，这绝对是我的光明。它能帮助你放松，帮助你集中精力，而且你们会经历很多起起落落。我建议你在高原或起床时养成这些好习惯，因为当你处于低谷时，很难说服自己做任何事情。但如果你养成了这种心理习惯，你就会更容易恢复。好吧，如果你掌握了基础知识，你睡得好，吃得好，锻炼好了，那么我们就可以开始谈论你能做的更有趣的事情，你应该做些什么来改变自己，让自己成为一个领导者，并真正把你的公司提升到一个更高的水平。

There are a bunch of kind of subcategories within  how to think about optimizing your mind.

在如何思考如何优化你的头脑中有很多种子类别。

The largest mistake people make, I think, in  terms of just thinking better, is they focus a lot on feeding their body, and  then they don't focus on feeding their brain. But ultimately, your brain, I think, is  just constantly doing pattern recognition, and the pattern recognition that it's doing is very much  powered by the information it's consumed.

我认为，人们犯的最大的错误是，从更好的思考角度来说，他们把注意力集中在喂饱自己的身体上，然后他们就不把注意力集中在大脑上。但最终，我认为你的大脑只是不断地进行模式识别，而它所做的模式识别很大程度上取决于它所消耗的信息。

And so, you really want to focus on feeding  your mind like you're feeding your body. What does that mean? In practice, I would  spend at least one day a week not working as hard as you can.

所以，你真的想把注意力集中在喂你的大脑上，就像你在喂你的身体一样。那是什么意思？实际上，我每周至少花一天的时间，不像你那样努力工作。

And  your goal here is, by as hard as you can, I mean, you want to  do whatever activity will help you feel the most refreshed when you come back to  work.

你的目标是，尽你所能，我是说，当你回到工作岗位时，你想做任何能让你感到最清新的活动。

And there's all sorts of interesting studies of spending time in nature is really  good for this, maybe going to the beach, whatever. I don't intend to be prescriptive,  but you really need to spend a day a week not working.

有各种各样有趣的研究表明，在大自然中消磨时间对此很有好处，比如去海滩，什么的。我不打算规规矩矩，但你真的需要每周花一天时间不工作。

This is really  helpful, because when you come back to work, you will have ... Your brain will  just be different, and it'll be solving problems in a more novel way, and let  me frame it this way. Your competitors are probably doing this, and they're coming up  with better answers than you are. So you should definitely take a sabbath. I mean,  it blows my mind that people don't do this. It's, I guess, a separation of  the urgent and the important that people struggle to do. I would focus a lot  on reading long form. I think a mistake people make here is, everyone talks about  reading a lot, and people get very obsessed with reading is a thing to do.  The greatest gift someone gave me is this idea of not really caring about what  you read, whether you even finish the book, just trying to read any book, any  time, all the time, every day. Because I, and I think this is common amongst  founders. You get obsessed in this mindset of, I gotta do it, I gotta finish  the book. You get stuck in a crappy book, you stop reading altogether, and now  you're on Instagram. It sucks. So just pick anything. Continually try to read it. I  find that the value that books give you, they're not just informational, they actually set  up your mind in a particular way. If you read a biography about a person,  you'll find yourself thinking a little bit more like that person thought, or like you  read that person thought.

这真的很有帮助，因为当你回来工作的时候，你会.你的大脑将是不同的，它将以一种更新颖的方式解决问题，让我把它描绘成这样。你的竞争对手可能在这样做，他们想出了比你更好的答案。所以你绝对应该去安息日。我是说，人们不这么做让我很吃惊。我想，这是人们努力去做的紧急和重要的分离。我会把注意力集中在阅读长篇文章上。我认为人们在这里犯的一个错误是，每个人都在谈论阅读，人们对阅读非常着迷，这是一件值得做的事情。别人给我的最大的礼物就是不关心你读了什么，不管你是否完成了这本书，只想读任何一本书，任何时间，每一天。因为我，我觉得这在创始人中很常见。你沉迷于这样的心态，我必须这样做，我必须完成这本书。你被困在一本蹩脚的书里，你完全停止阅读，现在你在Instagram上。真没意思所以随便挑什么就行了。不断地试着去读它。我发现书给你的价值，不仅仅是信息，它们实际上是以一种特殊的方式建立起你的思想。如果你读了一本关于一个人的传记，你会发现自己的想法更像那个人的想法，或者你读到了那个人的想法。

And I think that afterglow is really what you're trying to  get.

我认为余辉正是你想要得到的。

And I don't think you can get that from short form content. I would  sign out of all, unless your business is tied to it, in which case, good  luck. I would sign out of all this crap on your phone, and just make  it a little bit harder to use. Yeah. It's just too good is the main  problem.

我不认为你能从简短的内容中了解到这一点。除非你的生意和你的生意有关系，否则我会签字的，那样的话，祝你好运。我会在你手机上签下这些垃圾，让它更难用。嗯最主要的问题就是太好了。

This is just way too good.

这太好了。

Alright, so that's in terms of how you  should feed your brain. In terms of how you should think, like the software that's  running in your head, probably the largest thing you want to do is you want  to move from this mode, where you're playing first person, to this mode, where you're  playing third person.

好吧，这就是你应该如何喂养你的大脑。你应该如何思考，就像你脑子里运行的软件，你想要做的最大的事情可能是你想要从这个模式，在你扮演的第一个人，到这个模式，在这里你扮演的第三个人。

And what do I mean by that? I mean by that, it's  a little bit less I'm angry, and a little bit more, I'm feeling anger.

我这么说是什么意思？我的意思是，我不那么生气，更多的是，我感到愤怒。

The  other term people use for this mindfulness. I'm trying to avoid that and repackage it  in terms that seem a little bit more exciting. But it's building the habit of  kind of stepping out of the frame, and experiencing yourself almost in the third person.  This is really useful, because ... Well, it's actually not that useful if things go  really well, in which case all of your emotions are awesome. But when things start  going south, it's gonna become really important. It's gonna become also important when you start  doing bad things that are mostly a byproduct of your own insecurities. So someone, say,  who reports to you, says something disagreeable to you in a meeting, and it's quite  helpful to be able to step back and say, what's happening now is, I feel  insecure, as opposed to, I'm dumb. Which is what actually happens if you're playing in  first person. You'll be able to react better, you'll be able to lead people better.  In terms of how to do it, meditation is one way to achieve this.

人们使用的另一个术语是“正念”。我试图避免这种情况，并将其重新包装成看起来更令人兴奋的术语。但它正在养成一种走出框架的习惯，几乎是在第三人中体验自己。这真的很有用因为.。嗯，如果事情进展得很好的话，这实际上就没什么用了，在这种情况下，你所有的情绪都是很棒的。但当事情开始向南发展的时候，事情会变得非常重要。当你开始做坏事的时候，它也会变得很重要，这些事情大多是你自己不安全的副产品。所以有人，比如说，向你汇报的人，在会议上说了一些你不满意的话，而能够退一步说，现在发生的事情是，我感到不安全，而不是，我是个哑巴，这是很有帮助的。如果你是第一人称的话，这就是实际发生的事情。你会有更好的反应，你能更好地领导人们。就如何做到这一点而言，冥想是实现这一目标的一种方法。

There's  a lot of studies that show that it just happens as a byproduct of being  in your mind for more years. So just growing up. But I actually think the  most valuable way to get better at this is to just think about it, is  just have the concept in your head. But it is probably the largest, most important  mental shift I think you can do as a founder, because you're putting yourself through  an emotional rollercoaster. So that's kind of a large software shift that I think is  really, really important. In terms of other cheap hacks that relate to your mind, I  think the simplest goal that you should constantly be thinking about is how to spend  as much of your day in flow as possible. Flow is this concept of basically  becoming unaware of how time passes.

有许多研究表明，它只是作为一个副产品在你的脑海中存在了更多年。所以刚长大。但我认为，要想更好地做到这一点，最有价值的方法就是思考一下，就是在你的脑海里有一个概念。但这可能是我作为创始人所能做的最大、最重要的精神转变，因为你正在经历一场情绪上的过山车。所以这是一个巨大的软件转变，我认为这是非常重要的。至于与你的思想有关的其他廉价的黑客，我认为你应该经常考虑的最简单的目标是如何尽可能多地花时间在你的头脑中。流程是一种基本不知道时间是如何流逝的概念。

There's a book written by a gentleman whose last  name I can't pronounce, so I'm not even gonna bother. McHail something, about this topic  that I recommend reading. You want to spend as much of your time in flow  as possible, and if you're really good as a manager, you really want to spend  your entire team's day in flow as much as possible. People should be moving from  one thing to the next, to the next, to the next, not even really noticing  time fly by.

有一本书是一位先生写的，他的姓我不会发音，所以我甚至不会费心。关于这个话题，我推荐你去读。你想花尽可能多的时间在流程中，如果你真的是一个优秀的经理，你真的想尽可能多地花你整个团队的时间。人们应该从一件事转到另一件事，甚至没有真正注意到时间飞逝。

And that is, I don't have any instant solutions to that, but  you may be kind of noticing a theme across the talk here, which is the  key is to kind of launch and iterate. I would be constantly asking yourself, what  time of day is the best for you to do meeting? What time of day  is best for the team to do meetings? What music makes you productive? Is the  person you're going to put on a particular project, are they gonna enjoy that? Does  that match their personality? Maybe yes, maybe no. So you need constantly be in this  framework of trying different things and iterating. Don't be on autopilot.

也就是说，我对此没有任何即时的解决方案，但你可能会注意到这个演讲的主题，这是关键是启动和迭代。我会不断地问自己，一天中什么时候最适合你去开会？一天中什么时候最适合团队开会？什么音乐让你更有效率？你要把那个人放在一个特定的项目上，他们会喜欢这个吗？这符合他们的个性吗？也许问，也许不问因此，您需要不断地在这个框架内尝试不同的事情并进行迭代。别在自动驾驶仪上。

There's a lot of  information. Data laying on the ground, that comes out of an emission from whatever you  did, by putting a meeting super early in the morning, super late in the day,  bunching meetings together, keeping them separate. I don't mean to be prescriptive, because I actually  don't know that there is a global answer, but there's definitely and individualized one to  you.

有很多信息。数据躺在地面上，这些数据来自于你所做的任何事情所产生的排放，方法是在清晨召开一次会议，一天中很晚才召开会议，把会议聚集在一起，让它们彼此分开。我并不是说要规定性，因为我其实不知道有一个全球性的答案，但是你肯定有一个个性化的答案。

And the really great people are constantly iterating on whatever that is, trying to  improve themselves. So you should do that, 'cause the competition is doing that.

真正伟大的人总是在不断地重复这一切，试图提高自己。所以你应该这么做，因为竞争对手在这么做。

The last  thing I want to talk about is, probably the most important one of you as  you build out a team, which is how to become a really good, really inspiring  leader.

我最不想谈论的是，在你们建立一个团队的时候，最重要的一件事，就是如何成为一个真正好的，真正鼓舞人心的领导者。

There's a lot of different books on leadership, there's a lot of different studies  on it. Most of them are garbage.

关于领导力有很多不同的书，也有很多不同的研究。大部分都是垃圾。

There's one particularly good one that I'd like  to walk you guys through, which is Robert Keegan's theory of adult development. Robert Keegan  is a psychologist that has done a lot of work on adult development, distinct from  child development, which folks like [Piashay] have covered quite well.

有一个特别好的，我想告诉你们，这就是罗伯特·基根的成人发展理论。罗伯特·基根(RobertKeegan)是一位心理学家，他在成人发展方面做了大量工作，与儿童发展不同，像皮亚希这样的人对此做了很好的报道。

There's not that much literature  on how adults, say, circa 18 and beyond evolve in terms of their thinking and  thought patterns.

关于成年人，比如18岁及18岁以上的成年人，他们的思维和思维模式是如何进化的，目前还没有太多的文献。

And what he's done is he's kind of split out five different phases  that people tend to go through throughout life, and not all people make it to  the final two phases. We're really gonna focus here on stage two through five, since  one is basically really children.

他所做的是，他分裂出了五个不同的阶段，人们倾向于在一生中经历，但并不是所有的人都能进入最后的两个阶段。我们要把重点放在第二阶段到第五阶段，因为其中一个基本上是孩子。

And I'm gonna walk you through them, and then we'll  talk a little bit about how you can kind of advance from one phase to  the next. So let's talk a little bit about an imperial mind. You can kind  of think of this as a very simple AI.

我将带你们穿过它们，然后我们将讨论一下你们如何从一个阶段前进到下一个阶段。那么，让我们谈谈一个帝国精神。你可以认为这是一个非常简单的人工智能。

This is someone who is, for  the most part, these are children, but I think we all know some adults that  fit this bill.

在大多数情况下，这些人都是孩子，但我想我们都认识一些成年人，他们符合这一要求。

This is someone who is incredibly selfish, so they're very focused on  their own goals.

这是一个非常自私的人，所以他们非常专注于自己的目标。

That's the number one most important thing for them.

这是他们最重要的事情。

They're transactional, so  the relationship with other people is really just a way for them to get a  thing done that they want.

它们是事务性的，所以与其他人的关系实际上只是让他们完成他们想要的事情的一种方式。

The view of the other side is untenable to them.  So, oh, what do you think of person that brings up other ideas? Can't even  get there. Can't even see how that person would have that view.

对方的观点对他们来说是站不住脚的。那么，哦，你觉得提出其他想法的人怎么样？甚至到不了那里。根本看不出那个人怎么会有这种看法。

The challenge with  this mode is that, it's really hard to get people to cooperate with you over  the long term.

这种模式面临的挑战是，很难让人们长期与你合作。

As you guys grow teams, you may start seeing this flaw in  some managers. It becomes very easy to see actually when it's not you, but through  someone else where, people over time are just not interested in working for them or  don't find them compelling. So this is kind of the most embryonic phase you can  be in as an adult, which I think has some obviously limitations. Once you advance  beyond stage two, you get to stage three, the socialized mind, or as I call  it, the NPC.

当你们成长为团队时，你们可能会在一些经理身上看到这个缺陷。当它不是你的时候，它变得非常容易看到，但通过其他人，随着时间的推移，人们只是不感兴趣为他们工作，或认为他们没有吸引力。因此，这是你作为一个成年人最能处于的胚胎阶段，我认为这有一些明显的局限性。一旦你超越了第二阶段，你就进入了第三阶段，社会化的思想，或者我所说的全国人民代表大会。

The non-playable character in the game.

游戏中不可玩的角色。

This is most adults, and these  are people who are kind of able to see the other side, but they almost  see it too well.

这是大多数成年人，这些人能够看到另一面，但他们几乎看得太清楚了。

And in that sense, they're kind of NPCs.

从这个意义上说，他们是某种程度上的NPC。

They have no  internal locust of control.

它们内部没有控制蝗虫。

They really care about what other people are thinking about them  all the time, and the social narrative of, oh, people think I'm dumb, becomes their  narrative, therefore, I'm dumb, if that makes sense. So you've kind of pendulum swung a  little bit too far, where instead of not caring really about what other people think,  you now are entirely driven by it. Occasionally, we'll see founders that are kind of  in this mode. It's just really hard to have an independent mindset when you're in  this mode, and any great company, as you guys know, that faces a lot of  unknowns, and you have to be able to stare in the abyss and say, there's  a light at the end of the tunnel.

他们真的一直关心别人对他们的看法，而社会叙事，哦，人们认为我是哑巴，变成了他们的叙事，所以，如果这有意义的话，我就是哑巴。所以你的钟摆得有点太远了，你现在完全被它所驱使，而不是不关心别人的想法。偶尔，我们会看到在这种模式下的创始人。当你处于这种模式的时候，你很难有独立的心态，正如你们所知道的，任何一个伟大的公司都面临着很多未知的问题，你必须能够盯着深渊说，在隧道的尽头有一盏灯。

And it's really hard to do that  if you're constantly gut checking yourself about what other people think about you.

如果你经常检查别人对你的看法，那就很难做到这一点。

There's some  value here.

这里有些价值。

The opinion of other people is actually important. It's a great way to  know if you're doing something right or wrong.

别人的意见其实很重要。这是一个很好的方法来知道你做的是对的还是错的。

The problem with people in this mindset  is they're just unable to have their own framework for how to live life, or  their own truly independent ideals. Once you evolve beyond that, you reach the kind of  master player phase, or the self authoring phase.

在这种心态下，人们的问题是，他们无法拥有自己的生活框架，也无法拥有自己真正独立的理想。一旦你超越了这个阶段，你就进入了主玩家阶段，或者自我创作阶段。

And this is, in Keegan's view, some  adults. You have less motivation by social affirmation, and you have a kind of consistent,  independent frame of mind. So you have certain values, certain ideals, certain things you hold  yourself by, and you can identify with them, and you know what those are. I  am a person who cares a lot about X.

在基根看来，这是一些成年人。你对社会肯定的动机较少，而且你有一种一致的、独立的心态。所以你有一定的价值观，某些理想，某些你坚持的东西，你可以认同它们，你知道这些是什么。我是一个非常关心X的人。

And that's a part of the  inner monologue in your mind. Importantly, you're able to take responsibility for your own emotions.  So this comes back to that point of playing in the third person. I'm feeling  angry at you because you said, you kind of assaulted a value I hold dearly.  So you kind of know who you are at this phase.

这是你内心独白的一部分。重要的是，你能够对自己的情绪负责。所以这又回到了在第三人中玩的那一点。我生你的气是因为你说你侵犯了我非常珍视的价值。所以在这个阶段你知道你是谁。

This may actually be  the best phase for a founder. Because you have very clear ideals that you hold  onto, you kind of know who you are, you're aware of your emotions, and it's  slightly different from that second phase we were talking about moments ago. You're able to  kind of play an infinite game with people, where you're optimizing for the collective group,  not just for yourself. But you do have kind of a sense of where you  stand.

对于创始人来说，这可能是最好的阶段。因为你持有非常清晰的理想，你知道自己是谁，你意识到自己的情绪，这与我们刚才讨论的第二阶段略有不同。你可以和人们玩一个无限的游戏，在那里你在为集体优化，而不仅仅是为你自己。但你确实对自己的立场有一种感觉。

There is another phase beyond it, and Keegan's interesting claim here is that very  few adults make this phase.

除此之外还有另外一个阶段，基冈有趣的说法是，很少有成年人参与这一阶段。

The kind of self transforming mind.

那种自我转变的思想。

And if previously, we  were talking about a really competent game player, this would be almost a game designer.  This is someone who is not really held back by any sense of who they  are as a person, and what values and ideals they have, and is able to  basically embrace and extend any of the opinions and ideas of people around him. So  they're constantly being recreated by the group that they're in, if that makes sense. You  could almost, an engineering metaphor would be that this person can kind of run any  idea that comes to them in VM.

如果以前，我们谈论的是一个真正有能力的游戏玩家，这将几乎是一个游戏设计师。这个人并没有真正地被他们作为一个人，以及他们所拥有的价值观和理想的感觉所牵制，并且基本上能够接受和扩展他周围人的任何观点和想法。所以他们经常被他们所在的团队重新创造，如果这有意义的话。你几乎可以，一个工程的比喻是，这个人可以运行任何想法，他们在VM。

They can properly evaluate it.

他们可以正确地评估它。

They're genuinely curious  and interested in other people, they're willing to drop an entire ideology and swap it  for another one in moments, if it makes sense for them.

他们真的很好奇，对其他人很感兴趣，如果对他们来说有意义的话，他们愿意放弃整个意识形态，然后马上换另一个意识形态。

And unlike that second  phase, it's not being driven by what will other people think, it's truly being driven  by the quality of that idea and ideology.

与第二阶段不同的是，它不是由其他人的想法驱动的，而是真正由这种想法和意识形态的质量所驱动的。

The other very interesting thing about these  people that I find fascinating is, the tendency to think in systems. So when someone  is bringing up an idea, being able to very quickly realize, oh, they're bringing up  that idea because of X, Y, and Z, because that's their position in the organization,  or that's their background, or that's the environment they grew up in. It's almost like  you're seeing the entire map, or you're on the 100th floor of the building, and  you're seeing the entire city unfold underneath you, as opposed to being on the first  floor.

关于这些人，我发现另一件非常有趣的事情是，在系统中思考的倾向。所以当有人提出一个想法，能够很快意识到，哦，他们提出这个想法是因为X，Y和Z，因为这是他们在组织中的位置，或者是他们的背景，或者是他们成长的环境。就像你看到了整张地图，或者你在大楼的100层，你看到整个城市在你下面展开，而不是在一楼。

They make the interesting case that this is the vision, this is where you  want to get to. It's actually not clear to me for founders that you want  to be here until you have product market fit.

他们提出了一个有趣的案例，这就是你想要达到的目标。实际上，对于创始人来说，在产品市场适合你之前，你还不清楚你是否想待在这里。

There's something very interesting about these  people, which is, they're generally, I find, they're very good at managing very high quality  talent, who needs to be properly heard, needs to be properly understood in order to  be inspired to come into work every day. But danger of making metaphors, but when  you think of Elon or Steve Jobs, it's not clear that you end up here.  It's a little bit more stage four.

这些人有一些非常有趣的地方，我发现，他们一般都很擅长管理高素质的人才，他们需要被正确的倾听，需要被正确的理解，才能被激励每天开始工作。但是制造隐喻的危险，但是当你想到Elon或SteveJobs时，还不清楚你是否会在这里结束。更像是第四阶段。

They have an idea, and they're just gonna  railroad it through. But I think it's an interesting thing to hold onto long term,  and I definitely think that as you guys grow, and as your companies, you start  building out a strong executive bench, this is actually what's required to get players to  be interested in working for you. You have to really be able to set up  an environment where they can live their own ideology, and they feel challenged by you,  and they feel like you're willing to adopt it, and you can actually put together  people with very different ideologies and kind of get them to mesh together. It's like  you're designing the game, as opposed to being an individual player. So the question is,  okay, given where one is, and there's a case to be made that we can't  really ever evaluate where we stand on this kind of thing. How do you move  on to the next phase? How do you become less maybe self centered, and more  focused intrinsically in motivating others to join your cause? I think knowing the concepts actually  can really help, 'cause then you can kind of label some thoughts that you have  and say, well, that's stage two, not five.

他们有个主意，他们就会把它穿过去。但我认为长期坚持下去是件有趣的事情，我绝对认为，随着你们的成长，以及你们的公司，你们开始建立一个强大的行政长凳，这实际上是让球员们对为你们工作感兴趣所需要的。你必须建立一个环境，让他们能够生活在自己的意识形态中，他们觉得受到了你的挑战，他们觉得你愿意接受，你可以把不同意识形态的人聚集在一起，让他们融入其中。这就像你在设计游戏，而不是个人玩家。所以问题是，好吧，考虑到它在哪里，还有一个我们无法真正评估我们在这类事情上的立场的案例。你如何进入下一阶段？你如何变得不那么以自我为中心，而更专注于激励他人加入你的事业？我认为了解这些概念真的会有帮助，因为这样你就可以给你的一些想法贴上标签，然后说，那是第二阶段，而不是第五阶段。

And if you guys are interested in  this, you should just Google Bob Keegan and read any of his books. Time, according  to him, just kind of moves a person along a continuum here.

如果你们对此感兴趣，你们应该谷歌鲍勃·基根并阅读他的任何一本书。时间，据他说，只是在这里移动一个人的连续体。

There's, of course,  this question of derivative, how quickly you're moving. One very practical thing that I've learned  to do over the age, over the limited amount of time I've had on this  planet is, when interacting with people, especially people that you hire, I would only try  to ask questions you're generally interested in hearing the answer of. It's kind of interesting,  especially in interviews, to hear people ask these rogue questions they don't really care about,  because that's the conventional question to ask, and then they don't really listen to the  answer, and then they're not really having a good interaction with the person. So try  to nerd snipe yourself with this idea of, what would be the most fascinating question  to ask this person now? Even if it's someone who is saying something that you  drastically disagree with. It's an interesting brainstorm of, what is something they would say that  would cause me to change my opinion? That will just make, I think, life more  interesting for you, and maybe help you kind of work through that continuum. So that's  a little bit on leadership.

当然，还有一个导数的问题，你移动的速度有多快。随着时间的推移，我学会了做一件非常实际的事情，在这个星球上我所拥有的有限的时间是，当我与人互动时，尤其是你雇佣的人，我只会问一些你通常感兴趣的问题。这有点有趣，尤其是在面试中，听到人们问这些他们并不关心的流氓问题，因为这是常规的问题，然后他们不真正地听答案，然后他们就不能和那个人有很好的互动。所以，试着用这样的想法对自己发牢骚，现在问这个人最吸引人的问题是什么？即使是有人说了一些你完全不同意的话。这是一个有趣的头脑风暴，他们会说什么东西会使我改变我的观点？我认为，这只会让你的生活更加有趣，或许还能帮助你在这个连续体中工作。所以这有一点是关于领导力的。

A lot of this, especially if this is the first  time leading a team, a lot of this is stuff that you'll just figure out  as you go along. I do think it's helpful, a little bit, to have these  concepts in your mind, in terms of what's good and what's bad and where you  want to be. Okay. So I want to give you guys some closing thoughts. I  think it's really important that you, that the metaphor of the Olympics wasn't me kidding  around. I remember when I did YCombinator in winter 2010, James Lindenbaum, the CEO and  founder of Heroku came by, and he gave a talk.

很多这样的事情，特别是如果这是第一次带领一个团队的话，很多事情都是你在前进的时候就会发现的。我确实认为，在你的脑海中有这些概念是有帮助的，比如什么是好的，什么是坏的，以及你想去的地方。好的。所以我想给你们一些结束的想法。我认为你真的很重要，奥运会的比喻不是我在开玩笑。我记得2010年冬天我做YCombinator时，Heroku公司的首席执行官兼创始人詹姆斯·林登鲍姆(JamesLindenbaum)来过，他做了一个演讲。

And he said, a related  flavor of this, which is he said that you should bill yourself at 500 dollars  an hour. Which, at the time, seemed insane to me, until I found out that,  of course, that my lawyer was billing me at 750 an hour. But the point  is, your time is really precious, and especially as your team grows, you will be  increasing the choke point for getting things done.

他说，与此相关的一点是，他说你应该以每小时500美元的价格付账。当时，我觉得这很疯狂，直到我发现，当然，我的律师以每小时750英镑的价格向我收费。但关键是，你的时间是非常宝贵的，尤其是当你的团队成长的时候，你会增加完成任务的瓶颈。

And so, you really have to treat  yourself as an athlete if you want to survive this game, 'cause all of the  responsibility is on your shoulders.

所以，如果你想在这场比赛中生存下来，你就必须把自己当成运动员，因为所有的责任都在你的肩上。

And you cannot cave. You cannot cave and go for  the urgent instead of the important. It's just not acceptable. If it's helpful, I would  just assume that the others have figured this out, and they're ahead of you, and  you just need to catch up to them. So you just assume that they're well  rested, they're eating properly, they're thinking properly, so when you find you're ... I certainly  had nights when I was running my company where I found myself at the office,  three o'clock in the morning, eating Skittles.

你不能屈服。你不能屈服于急事而不是重要的事。这是不能接受的。如果有帮助的话，我会假设其他人已经解决了这个问题，他们就在你前面，你只需要赶上他们。所以你就假设他们休息得很好，他们吃得很好，他们的思维也很正常，所以当你发现你.当我经营公司的时候，我确实有过几个晚上，我发现自己在办公室里，凌晨三点钟，吃着海龟。

This is not a good scene.

这一幕不太好。

This idea  of switching to third party camera mode, and experiencing yourself in the third person is  really important. You guys are gonna have days, months, weeks, where you get punched in  the face a lot. Like someone wants to quit, and you lose a customer, and  things aren't growing.

这个想法，切换到第三方相机模式，并体验自己在第三人是真正重要的。你们会有几天，几个月，几周的时间，你们会经常被打在脸上。就像有人想要辞职，而你失去了一个客户，而事情并没有发展。

The only way to survive that, and when you're in that mode,  still play all the right chess moves, is to experience your emotions in the third  person. Otherwise, you get caught up in it, and it's just lame, honestly. So I  spend a lot of time thinking about that.

唯一的生存方式，当你在这种模式下，仍然进行所有正确的棋步，是体验你的情绪在第三人。否则，你就会陷入其中，老实说，这太差劲了。所以我花了很多时间思考这个问题。

The particulars of any hack don't really  matter. I don't care if you don't actually drink water.

任何黑客的细节都不重要。我不在乎你是否真的不喝水。

The key thing here is  to launch and iterate yourself, kind of. You have a lot of data going on  about what's good, what's bad, what days make you feel good, what days make you  feel bad.

这里的关键是启动和迭代自己，某种程度上。你有很多关于什么是好的，什么是坏的，什么天让你感觉好，什么天让你感觉不好的数据。

And just collect that information, and retrain your model, over and over and  over. I would very much try to just be genuinely curious of other people. I  think if you are, you'll find out, other people are just the most interesting thing  on the planet. Far more so than VI, or whatever engineering problem you're solving. It's  far more dynamic than a computer.

收集这些信息，一遍又一遍地对你的模型进行再培训。我会非常努力地对其他人产生真正的好奇。我认为如果你是，你会发现，其他人只是地球上最有趣的事情。比VI或者你正在解决的任何工程问题都要严重得多。它比电脑更有活力。

And if you get really interested in what drives  other people, what motivates them, you'll get really good at recruiting other people, you'll get  really good at motivating other people, but you have to really treat it as a  system that you're genuinely interested in.

如果你真正感兴趣的是什么驱使着其他人，是什么激励了他们，你会很好地招募其他人，你会非常善于激励其他人，但你必须把它作为一个你真正感兴趣的系统来对待。

Always try to ask compelling questions of other people.  Don't bore them, don't bore yourself.

总是试着问别人有说服力的问题。别烦他们，别烦你自己。

The last thing is a concept that's a little  bit hard to convey, but was one of the most helpful shifts I went through,  which is, you want to move from playing very finite games in life to infinite  games.

最后一件事是一个有点难以传达的概念，但这是我经历过的最有用的转变之一，那就是，你想要从在生活中玩非常有限的游戏转变成无限的游戏。

And what I mean by that is, ten thousand different things, but I guess  at a high level, you have ... I think when you get started, you tend  to get very worried in various interactions that you have with people that it's zero  sum.

我的意思是，一万种不同的东西，但我想在很高的层次上，你有.我认为当你开始的时候，你会在与人的各种互动中感到非常担心，那就是零和。

That it's a win lose situation. Maybe there's an idea you have, but you're  not sure if you should share it with someone, 'cause maybe if you give it  to them, then they'll go out and run with it, and then they'll steal all  the credit, and you'll be the [Winkelvoss] and they'll be Mark Zuckerberg or something.

这是输赢的局面。也许你有一个想法，但你不确定你是否应该和别人分享，因为也许如果你把它给他们，他们就会带着它跑出去，然后他们会偷走所有的荣誉，你会成为[温克尔沃斯]，他们会是马克·扎克伯格什么的。

And  it's really important to let those thoughts go. You very much want to make believe  you're playing an infinite game that doesn't really have an end.

让这些想法消失是很重要的。你很想让人相信你在玩一个没有结束的无限游戏。

The scoreboard is really  unclear, and you're just trying to engender as much good will as you want.

记分板真的很不清楚，你只是想要产生多少好的意愿。

There's  a great book on this topic called Finite and Infinite Games, that helps set this  kind of mental frame. Because it's very hard to explain in words, but ... Whoa.  Someone's playing Mario. But you want to, I guess, move a little bit from being  focused on winning one particular interaction, to winning the overall set of interactions. Said differently,  you're running a marathon, you're not sprinting. So that's it. So that's a little bit  of a rant, hopefully a semi-productive rant, on what you need to be doing in  order to kind of improve yourself, in order to advance to the next level.

关于这个主题，有一本很棒的书，叫做“有限和无限游戏”，它帮助建立了这种精神框架。因为这很难用语言来解释，但是.哇哦。有人在玩马里奥。但我想，你要从专注于赢得一种特定的互动，转向赢得一套整体的互动。换句话说，你在跑马拉松，而不是冲刺。就这样吧。所以，这是一种小小的咆哮，希望是一种半生产性的咆哮，你需要做些什么才能提高自己，才能提升到更高的水平。

And  at the very least, should be a good overview of some incredibly common startup mistakes  people make. To the 50% of you that actually follow this advice and avoid those  mistakes, awesome.

至少，应该很好地概括一下人们在创业过程中犯的一些令人难以置信的常见错误。对于你们中50%的人来说，他们确实遵循了这个建议，并且避免了这些错误，太棒了。

And to the 50% that don't, or probably 90% that don't, I told  you so.

对于50%的人没有，或者90%的人没有，我告诉过你们。

Thank you so much. You want to ... Sorry?

非常感谢你想.。抱歉的

Geoff Ralston: Want to do a Q&A?

Geoff Ralston:想做问答吗？

Daniel Gross: Q&A, yes. Sure.

Daniel Gross:问答，是的。好的

Speaker 3: Do you have any experience with people who left a comfortable position at the corporation,  and then having to deal with ups and downs [inaudible] ?

演讲者3：你对那些离开公司一个舒适职位的人有过什么经验，然后不得不应付起起落落(听不见)？

Geoff Ralston: Can you please repeat the question?

Geoff Ralston:你能重复一下这个问题吗？

Daniel Gross: Yeah, so the question was, for people that leave comfortable corporate positions, how they handle  the rollercoaster of a startup. I think ... Yeah, so occasionally, you see founders who  ...

Daniel Gross:是的，所以问题是，对于离开舒适的公司职位的人来说，他们是如何应对一家初创公司的过山车的。我觉得.。是的，所以偶尔，你会看到创始人.

There's basically two reactions to this. If you leave your kind of great job  at Google, and you go join a startup rollercoaster. One reaction is, a version, effectively.  Oh, I don't want to deal with that, not focus on it, or I got  very used to having, taking an extra day off on the weekend, so I'm just  not gonna give that up.

对此基本上有两种反应。如果你离开了你在谷歌的那份好工作，你就加入了一家初创公司的过山车。一种反应是，一个有效的版本。哦，我不想处理这个问题，也不想把注意力集中在这个问题上，或者我已经习惯了，周末多休一天假，所以我不会放弃。

Those companies, sadly, don't do well.

不幸的是，那些公司做得不好。

And I think those  people are unhappy in the process while they're doing it. Startups are ultimately, you're playing  on expert mode, and it only makes sense if you're gonna commit.

我认为那些人在做这件事的过程中很不开心。创业公司最终是，你在专家模式下玩，只有当你要承诺的时候才有意义。

A lot of  other people, I think most founders that we've worked with, humans are resilient.

很多其他人，我认为大多数和我们一起工作过的创始人，人类都是有弹性的。

And so  you kind of figure it out. I think the real take on it is not  whether the person got too comfortable. It's really like, are they innately interested in working  on the problem they're working on? That's what I think is going on with a  lot of those people, is they leave a Google to start a company because they  feel like they should start a company, as opposed to really being interested in making  something, if that makes sense. So that's the thing I would focus on. Because if  you're really interested in something, of course you'll spend all day thinking about it. Sure.

所以你想清楚了。我认为真正的问题不是这个人是否太舒服了。这就像，他们天生就对解决他们正在研究的问题感兴趣吗？我认为很多人都是这样的，他们离开谷歌创建一家公司，因为他们觉得自己应该创建一家公司，而不是真正感兴趣地做些什么，如果这是有意义的话。所以这就是我要关注的事情。因为如果你真的对某件事感兴趣，你当然会花一整天的时间来思考它。好的

Speaker 4: If you're trying to minimize the amount of time you spend online, but your business  forces you to go on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter for whatever reason, how do  you recommend mitigating that problem, or dealing with the mental health effects of that?

演讲者4：如果你想尽量减少你上网的时间，但你的业务迫使你以任何理由去Facebook、Instagram或Twitter上，你建议如何减轻这个问题，或者如何处理这种问题对心理健康的影响？

Daniel Gross: Okay, so the question is, if you business kind of demands of you to be  online, how do you handle falling into the simple maximizer trap. One very funny thing  we used to do in my company is, we all had our monitors facing each  other, if that makes sense, and so there was kind of a circle.

Daniel Gross:好吧，问题是，如果你在网上做生意，你如何处理掉进简单的最大化陷阱。在我的公司里，我们经常做的一件非常有趣的事情是，我们每个人都有自己的显示器，如果这有意义的话，那么我们就有了一个圆圈。

And there's  a weird accountability that gets enforced when you do that. Of course, no one is  actually watching your monitor, they're busy doing your own work. But you have a little  voice in your head that's saying, maybe they are. So that's a fun hack that  I think works quite well, kind of team enforceability. I think the other solution to  this is not really tackling that problem, but really focusing on something else, which is  growing as quickly as possible.

当你这么做的时候，有一种奇怪的责任会被强制执行。当然，没有人在看你的班长，他们在忙着做你自己的工作。但你脑子里有个小小的声音，就是说，也许是的。所以这是一次有趣的黑客攻击，我认为效果很好，类似于团队的可执行性。我认为解决这一问题的另一个办法不是真正解决这个问题，而是真正关注其他方面，这些问题正在迅速发展。

And if you do, this will just have to be  a demon you slay in the process of growing as quickly as possible, 'cause you  cannot grow if you're watching YouTube. Unless you're watching your own videos. Yeah?

如果你这么做了，这将是你在尽可能快的成长过程中杀死的恶魔，因为如果你在看YouTube，你就无法成长。除非你是在看你自己的视频。是吗？

Speaker 5: Hi. I was wondering, what's your personal mantra about startup life? Elon Musk says that  launching a company is, well, he had a friend that said, eating-

演讲者5：嗨。我在想，关于创业生活，你的个人格言是什么？伊隆·马斯克说创办一家公司，他有个朋友说，吃-

Daniel Gross: Chewing glass and staring into the abyss?

Daniel Gross:嚼玻璃，盯着深渊看？

Speaker 5: Yes.

发言者5：是的。

And my personal line is, it's an involuntary vow of poverty that requires a  zen-like state of mind. What's yours?

我个人的看法是，这是一种非自愿的贫困誓言，需要一种类似禅宗的心态。你的是什么？

Daniel Gross: Okay, so the question is, what's my mantra regarding startups. I don't know that I'm  smart enough to have a mantra about it. But probably if I were to have  one, it would be something akin to what I mentioned earlier. It's like playing a  video game on expert mode, where the video game is really managing your own psychology  and trying to build a product that works. I do think we shouldn't frame this  as something that is painful. I think there are a phenomenal amount of ups that  go with the downs, and for every Elon Musk quote where he's chewing glass and  staring into the abyss, he also gets to see his roadster in space.

Daniel Gross:好吧，那么问题是，我关于创业的咒语是什么？我不知道我是否聪明到能对此有个口头禅。但是，如果我有一个，它可能是类似于我前面提到的东西。这就像在专家模式下玩电子游戏，电子游戏实际上是在管理你自己的心理，并试图建立一个有效的产品。我确实认为我们不应该把这当成是痛苦的东西。我认为有大量的起起落落，每一个埃隆马斯克引用的话，他在咀嚼玻璃和凝视深渊，他也可以看到他的跑车在太空。

That's pretty  good. So yeah. So I think it's just, I mean, you have to really enjoy  building stuff, ultimately. Yes?

挺不错的。所以是的。所以我认为这只是，我的意思是，你必须真正享受建筑材料，最终。是

Speaker 6: Thank you very much, Daniel.

演讲者6：非常感谢你，丹尼尔。

This has been fantastic. I really like how this sets  up a system of poor self alliance, and identifies [inaudible] . But I've also set  up some mentorship and communities to support myself. Is there something you would talk to  about how you found community, or creating something to support you as you fought through,  and what's worked and what hasn't?

这真是太棒了。我真的很喜欢这如何建立一个糟糕的自我联盟体系，并识别(听不见的)。但我也建立了一些导师和社区来支持我自己。你是否会谈论你是如何找到社区的，或者在你努力奋斗的过程中创造一些支持你的东西，以及哪些是有效的，哪些是没有的呢？

Daniel Gross: Well this is ... Okay, so the question is, strategies around building community and peers  in order to kind of help yourself become better.

Daniel Gross:嗯，这是.。好的，所以问题是，建立社区和同龄人的策略，以帮助自己变得更好。

This is, actually, I think, one  of the main benefits of startup school, and assuredly, one of the main benefits of  YC, is that you get put in a peer group with other people.

事实上，我认为，这是创业学校的主要好处之一，也是YC的主要好处之一，就是你和其他人一起被安排到一个同龄人群体中。

And what  happens is, you very quickly figure out, humans are fascinating.

你很快就会发现，人类是迷人的。

They subconsciously almost figure out,  where am I in the peer group, who is next to me, who is ahead  of me on the leaderboard, who is beneath me, where do I stand, and how  can I advance myself? I think this is also one of the reasons why Ivy  League campuses are so good. It's not really the curriculum of the Ivy League. It's  the fact that you're suddenly surrounded by peers who are motivating you to be better.  So startup school is, I think, one very interesting way of scalably trying to give  that to as many people as possible on the internet, because we know that when  you're kind of with relative peers, you're always trying to figure out how to improve  yourself. Yeah, so doing startup school is one answer to your question. To me, the  largest value of YC is, I was suddenly challenged by the fact that I thought  other people in my batch were really darn good, and I kind of realized I  could compete on the same playing field. So I'd encourage you guys to apply to  YC, and also figure out other ... I don't know if there are other online  communities where you can kind of have that same sense of competing on the leaderboard.  Okay.

他们几乎下意识地意识到，我在同龄人群体中的位置，谁在我旁边，谁在我的领导板上，谁在我下面，我站在哪里，我如何提升自己？我认为这也是常春藤联盟校园如此好的原因之一。这不是常春藤联盟的课程。这是一个事实，那就是你突然被那些激励你变得更好的同龄人所包围。因此，我认为，创业学校是一种非常有趣的方式，它可以让尽可能多的人在互联网上获得这一点，因为我们知道，当你和相对的同龄人在一起时，你总是想办法提高自己。是啊，所以创业学校是你问题的答案之一。对我来说，YC最大的价值是，我突然被这样的事实所挑战，我认为我的批次中的其他人都是非常好的，我意识到我可以在同样的竞争环境中竞争。所以我会鼓励你们申请YC的同时也想出其他的.。我不知道是否有其他的在线社区，你可以有同样的感觉，竞争的主板。好的。

All the way back.

一路走回来。

Speaker 7: Kind of going off of that note, when you're in an environment like this, it  seems like everyone is really great at doing the exact opposite of what you just  talked about. But it seems to land some pretty good results. How do you counter  that [inaudible] ?

演讲者7：有点偏离音符，当你处在这样的环境中，似乎每个人都很擅长做与你刚才所说的完全相反的事情。但它似乎取得了一些不错的结果。你怎么反驳那个[听不见的]？

Daniel Gross: So the question is, how do I counter the proposed reality where people are doing  the opposite of this presentation, and achieving greatness.

Daniel Gross:所以问题是，我怎样才能对抗被提议的现实，即人们正在做与这个演讲相反的事情，并取得伟大的成就。

And I guess I would question the  premise. I'm not sure I agree with you. I'm pretty sure that any successful unicorn  founder that you meet today would kind of agree with what I said here, which  is, even if they were doing all this crap that I defined as a mistake,  they wish they hadn't. So there's one interesting, really interesting view, which is, this is  a necessary pain you have to go through. You wish you hadn't, but it was  worthwhile. I'm not sure I buy that. Life doesn't have to suck.

我想我会质疑前提。我不太同意你的看法。我敢肯定，你今天遇到的任何一位成功的独角兽创始人都会同意我在这里说的话，那就是，即使他们做了这些我定义为错误的废话，他们也希望他们没有这样做。所以有一个有趣的，非常有趣的观点，那就是，这是你必须经历的必要的痛苦。你希望你没有，但这是值得的。我不确定我信不信。生活不一定要烂。

And you don't  have to make mistakes to be successful. Please.

你不需要犯错误才能成功。请

Speaker 8: Hi Daniel, I'm [inaudible] .

演讲者8：嗨，丹尼尔，我是[听不见的]。

Daniel Gross: Oh, that's good to know.

Daniel Gross:哦，很高兴知道。

Speaker 8: This is amazing. No, for sure. I was a founder that was working 120, 140  hours a week, for a social network, and then I realized, social doesn't work. I  still have the mission. What would you recommend during, while you're trying to think of  the next solution, next product? What would you recommend founders to do? It's actually still  kind of [inaudible] , or do something else meanwhile?

演讲者8：这太棒了。不，当然。我是一个创始人，每周工作120，140个小时，为一个社交网络工作，然后我意识到，社交不起作用。我还有任务。在你尝试下一个解决方案的时候，你会推荐什么，下一个产品？你会推荐创始人做什么？实际上，它仍然有点(听不见)，或者同时做其他的事情？

Daniel Gross: So the question is, what's kind of a good way of coming up with your  next product idea?

Daniel Gross:那么问题是，提出下一个产品创意的好方法是什么？

Speaker 8: Yeah.

演讲者8：是的。

Daniel Gross: Or pivot. You also mentioned in your question that you were working on ... One  thing I wanna be clear to everyone here is, I'm not proposing you don't work  hard. In order to win, you have to work hard. I'm proposing you don't moronically  work hard, and not sleep. Because then, you're gonna have to work much harder, even,  to catch up. But your question was how to come up with startup ideas. Okay,  I think the ... So there's a lot of great content on this topic. PG,  Paul Graham has probably written the best of it. I'm not gonna be able to  one up him. But I think the, a common mistake that comes to mind right  now, in terms of mistakes people make when they try to come up with startup  ideas is, they're very focused on trying to come up with an idea in a  very limited amount of time.

Daniel Gross:或者枢轴。你还在你的问题中提到了你正在做的事.我想对在座的每个人说清楚的一点是，我不是在建议你不努力工作。为了赢，你必须努力工作。我建议你不要努力工作，也不要睡觉。因为那样的话，你就得更加努力地工作，甚至，才能赶上。但你的问题是如何想出创业的点子。好吧我觉得.。关于这个话题有很多很好的内容。保罗·格雷厄姆可能写得最好。我不可能超过他。但我认为，人们现在想到的一个常见错误，在人们试图想出创业点子时所犯的错误是，他们非常专注于在有限的时间内想出一个想法。

And it's not clear to me that stuff works in  a pressure cooker. I think, to me, I've had my best ideas when I haven't  had any kind of immediate goal, have to come up with an idea, and they  just start kind of coming to you. I have a Google doc of maybe a  thousand different ideas, of which I'll build probably none. But, I think the point is,  it's much easier to think of this when you're not necessarily in a pressure cooker.  And I'd really question the fact of, maybe you don't need a startup idea. One  of a very common mistake I see in a lot of YC applicants is, they're  obsessed with starting a startup, which is actually not what you want to do. My  greatest hope when I have an idea today is that someone else will build it.  I have no interest in going through the whole startup thing. So if you don't  have any great ideas, that's not a problem, that's not a bug or a flaw.  Yes?

我不清楚这些东西在压力锅里能起什么作用。我想，对我来说，当我没有任何直接目标的时候，我已经有了我最好的想法，必须想出一个主意，然后他们就开始向你走来。我有一个谷歌文档，可能有上千种不同的想法，我可能不会建立。但是，我想重点是，当你不一定在压力锅里的时候，想这个就容易多了。我真的很怀疑，也许你不需要创业的想法。我在很多YC申请者身上看到的一个非常普遍的错误是，他们痴迷于创业，这实际上不是你想要做的。当我今天有一个想法的时候，我最大的希望是其他人会建造它。我对整个创业过程都不感兴趣。所以，如果你没有什么好主意，那不是问题，也不是错误或缺陷。是

Speaker 9: How do you get out of this pressure cooker, and how do you manage the  risk? What's a good [inaudible] to think about risk?

演讲者9：你是如何摆脱这个高压锅的，你是如何管理风险的？考虑风险有什么好处(听不见)？

Daniel Gross: So the question is, how do I get out of the pressure cooker, and how  do I manage risk. Two different questions, I think, if I understand the second one  properly. I think the best way to get out of the pressure cooker is, I  would just take a day a week, Saturday, and just, like I mentioned, not work.  Physically, go north of, if you live in San Francisco, go north of it and  walk in the woods for a while.

Daniel Gross:所以问题是，我如何摆脱高压锅，以及如何管理风险。两个不同的问题，我想，如果我正确地理解第二个问题。我认为摆脱高压锅最好的方法是，我每周、星期六只花一天时间，就像我说的，不工作。身体上，往北走，如果你住在旧金山，往北走，在树林里走一段时间。

That's great.

太好了

And I don't think you need  much more than that. How do I think about managing risk? That's a very big  question. Boy. I think a lot of it depends on ... Well, I think a  very common mistake, maybe this will be somewhat novel or interesting.

我不认为你需要更多的东西。我如何看待风险管理？这是个很大的问题。男孩我认为这在很大程度上取决于.。嗯，我认为这是一个很常见的错误，也许这会有点新奇或有趣。

A common mistake people  make when managing risk is, they pattern match type one and type two decisions improperly.  That is to say, this is the Jeff Bezos framework of, you got your type  one decisions, where the cost of downside is catastrophic. Type two decisions where ultimately, if  you make the mistake, nothing bad happens.

人们在管理风险时所犯的一个常见错误是，他们的模式与第一类和第二类决策不相匹配。也就是说，这是JeffBezos的框架，你有你的第一类决定，在那里，负面的代价是灾难性的。输入两个决定，最终，如果你犯了错误，没有什么不好的事情发生。

And I think a very common flaw is,  you think things are type one, when they're in fact type two.

我认为一个很常见的缺陷是，你认为事物是第一类的，而实际上它们是第二类。

And more often  than not, the right call is to just go for it, whatever the risky path  is. Because the downside scenario you're imagining is a little bit too creative, probably. So  I've definitely found when I've taken the riskier approach, I definitely have been rewarded by  life, and I'll probably continue saying that until suddenly I'll just die because I decided  to jump out of an airplane.

而且更多的时候，正确的要求就是去争取它，不管这条道路有多危险。因为你想象的负面情景可能有点太有创意了。所以我发现，当我采取风险更高的方法时，我肯定得到了生命的回报，我很可能会继续这么说，直到我突然死去，因为我决定从飞机上跳下去。

That was a bad idea. So maybe there's a  survivorship bias problem. But more often than not, the riskier path is the right one.  One more question. Sure. Sorry.

那是个坏主意。所以也许存在生存偏见问题。但通常情况下，风险更大的道路是正确的。还有一个问题。好的抱歉的

Speaker 10: Let's say you're on board with all this, but the problem is that your co-founder  is not really that easily prioritizing this stuff. Can you talk about sort of co-founders  doing some prioritizing?

演讲者10：假设你同意所有这些，但问题是，你的联合创始人并没有那么容易地把这些东西放在轻重缓急的位置上。你能谈谈联合创始人做一些优先排序的事吗？

Daniel Gross: Sure, yeah. So the question is how to get your co-founders on board for doing  this stuff.

Daniel Gross:当然，是的。所以问题是如何让你的联合创始人参与其中。

And again, I should re-embellish. Doing this stuff doesn't mean chilling. It means  not dying while you're building your company. So I think a lot of it is  the framing.

再说一次，我应该重新装饰一下。做这些并不意味着让人心寒。意思是在你建立公司的时候不要死。所以我觉得很大程度上是因为框架。

And I think if you're not careful with the framing, it comes across  as, let's bring the perks of Google into our startup life, which is a recipe  for disaster. It's hard.

我认为如果你对框架不小心的话，就会发现，让我们把谷歌的好处带入我们的创业生活，这是一种灾难。这很难。

This is a weird piece of advice, 'cause like I mentioned  three or four times, a lot of people refuse to, or are just unable to  accept it, and they need to fail and fall on their face before they retrain  the model. In general, though, I think this is a very interesting question. What to  do in situations where you disagree with your co-founders, especially if there's no tiebreaker. Super  common problem.

这是一个奇怪的建议，因为就像我三、四次提到的，很多人拒绝，或者只是无法接受，他们需要失败和失败才能重新训练这个模式。不过，总的来说，我认为这是一个非常有趣的问题。在你不同意你的联合创始人的情况下，你该怎么做，尤其是在没有打破僵局的情况下。超级常见的问题。

Another founder. Product decisions. What do you do when you disagree? One useful  hack I did for a while with my co-founder, 'cause we were great friends, best  friends in fact. But we used to have these bitter product disagreements. You can just  cycle through different months where people have responsibility on a particular area, and so you  can say, look, for the next six months, you're running product. I may not agree  with you, you get to run product.

另一位创始人。产品决策。当你不同意的时候你会怎么做？我和我的联合创始人做了一次有用的黑客攻击，因为我们是很好的朋友，实际上是最好的朋友。但我们曾经有过这些痛苦的产品分歧。你可以通过不同的月份，人们对某一特定领域负有责任，所以你可以说，看，在接下来的六个月里，你在运行产品。我可能不同意你的意见，你可以经营产品。

And then six months afterwards, we'll check in.  Maybe we'll swap over. But just really defining time constrained areas where a person gets  ultimate ownership is one, I think, underrated solution to the co-founder disagreement problem. So hopefully  that's somewhat useful.

六个月后，我们会办理入住手续。也许我们可以交换一下。但我认为，真正界定一个人获得最终所有权的时间限制领域，是解决联合创始人分歧问题的一个被低估的解决方案。希望这能有所帮助。

Alright.

好吧。

Thank you all for listening. Sorry we started late, and I'll  be around here if you guys have any questions I can help answer.
