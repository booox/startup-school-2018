# A Conversation with Elad Gil

- Okay, the AC's on, we're good. Good morning, everyone.

好的空调开了我们没事大家早上好

- [Audience] Good morning.

-[观众]早上好。

- I am very happy to have my friend Elad Gil here. You saw, some of you, or all of you if you looked online, a talk yesterday about how to get meetings with investors and raise money. If you would be so lucky as to get a meeting with this investor, and even more lucky to raise money from him, that would be a really good thing for your company. Elad's sort of an epic investor. He's had an epic career investing, but he's much more than that. He's not only a fantastic investor who's invested in a lot of YC companies, it seems like all the successful ones. Someday you have to tell me how you figured out how to do that. Maybe we can talk about that today. But he's also a startup founder. He's worked at Google and Twitter, and he is increasingly known as an author. He claims it's not his career, but he is an author of High Growth Handbook, which is a very cool book. I recommend you all read it, but not maybe right while you're starting your startup. Maybe as your startup gets going because a lot of the topics in there will be relevant for you hopefully in the future. Maybe you can start off the conversation by telling us a little bit about how you got to where you are today. What's your journey to epic investor and startup founder and, I guess, company whisperer?

-我很高兴我的朋友Elad Gil在这里你看到了，你们中的一些人，或者你们所有人-如果你们在网上看的话-昨天有一次关于如何与投资者会面和筹集资金的演讲。如果你有幸与这位投资者会面，更幸运地从他那里筹到钱，那对你的公司来说将是一件非常好的事情。伊拉德是个史诗般的投资者。他有着史诗般的职业生涯投资，但他远不止这些。他不仅是一位出色的投资者，投资了很多YC公司，而且似乎是所有成功的公司。总有一天你得告诉我你是怎么知道怎么做的。也许我们今天可以谈谈这个。但他也是初创公司的创始人。他曾在谷歌(Google)和推特(Twitter)工作，作为一名作家，他越来越出名。他声称这不是他的职业生涯，但他是“高增长手册”的作者，这本书很酷。我建议你们都读一读，但在你创业的时候，也许不是正确的。也许当你的创业开始的时候，因为里面的很多话题都会和你相关，希望在将来。也许你可以先告诉我们你是如何到达今天的状态的。你是如何与史诗般的投资者和初创公司创始人，我想，公司的耳语？

- Sure. First of all, thanks for having me here. Really excited to be here for Startup School. I moved out here right after graduate school. I moved out, I didn't know anybody. Many of my friends decided to stay on the East Coast, and so I was sort of starting fresh when I first came out here. I had terrible market timing in that I moved out here right as the entire internet bubble was collapsing. I went into an environment where a year after I got here, most people were getting laid off, and most people were desperately looking for jobs. Somebody who was a vice president of product management was suddenly trying to get any product manager job they could get at any level at any company. It was a very odd environment. It was a very tough one to plug into. This was before things like YC existed. There was no online content around starting companies. There was no content about basically doing anything. What you had to do was really hand-to-hand combat in terms of networking and meeting people. I basically talked my way into a job by offering to work for free at a startup. That was my entree was basically an unpaid laborer on behalf of a company as a way to get my foot in the door and get my foot into technology. That was basically my starting point.

-当然。首先，谢谢你让我来这里。很高兴能来这里参加创业学校。我刚毕业就搬过来了。我搬出去了，我谁都不认识。我的许多朋友决定留在东海岸，所以当我第一次来到这里的时候，我开始有点新鲜了。我有一个糟糕的市场时机，我搬到这里，因为整个互联网泡沫正在崩溃。我来到这里一年后，大多数人都被解雇了，大多数人都在拼命地找工作。一位负责产品管理的副总裁突然试图在任何一家公司获得任何级别的产品经理职位。这是一个非常奇怪的环境。这是一个很难插入的问题。这是在YC这样的东西存在之前。在创办公司时，没有在线内容。从根本上说，做任何事都是没有内容的。你所要做的就是在人际关系和与人见面方面进行肉搏战。我基本上是通过在一家初创公司免费工作的方式来获得一份工作的。那是我的主菜，基本上是一名无报酬的工人，代表一家公司，作为一种方法，让我踏进自己的大门，让我的脚踏入科技领域。这基本上是我的出发点。

- That's a good lesson for how, even in today's world where there's many more resources for how, you have to really pound the pavement. It's elbow grease to get started lots of times, right?

-这是一个很好的教训，即使在今天的世界里，有更多的资源用于如何，你必须真正地敲打路面。很多次都是手肘油，对吧？

- Yeah, absolutely. I think what happened is after, so I got a Ph.D in biology, so it's completely irrelevant to software and technology, but I wanted to go into software and technology.

-是的，当然.我认为这是在之后，所以我获得了生物学博士学位，所以这与软件和技术完全无关，但我想研究软件和技术。

- Well, completely irrelevant at the time to software and technology.

-嗯，当时与软件和技术完全无关。

- Completely irrelevant at the time.

-当时完全无关紧要。

- But it changed later, right?

-但后来改变了，对吧？

- It's changed. Basically, my first software startup job allowed me then to be a software person. That was the thing that led me to do a transition. I actually moved out here to join a telecom equipment startup as a product manager, so I worked on hardware. I had to leave that company, and then I talked my way into working for free at a software company. Then I was suddenly a software person. That's what led to me then eventually ending up at Google and other places.

它变了基本上，我的第一份软件创业工作让我成为了一名软件人。这就是导致我转型的原因。实际上，我搬到这里是为了加入一家电信设备初创公司，担任产品经理，所以我从事硬件方面的工作。我不得不离开那家公司，然后我说服自己在一家软件公司免费工作。然后我突然变成了一个软件人。这就是我最终来到谷歌和其他地方的原因。

- You ended up at Google. But let's talk a little bit about, 'cause you ended up working at Google and Twitter, but you started companies in between, and in the end, sort of transitioned into becoming an investor. How did that all happen?

-你最后在谷歌但让我们谈谈，因为你最终在谷歌和推特工作，但你在两者之间创办了公司，最终转变成了一个投资者。这一切是怎么发生的？

- Yeah, so I joined Google in 2004 and effectively started the mobile team there. I helped buy Android, and pulled together their early teams for Google Mobile Maps and Mobile Gmail, each of which have hundreds of millions of users, but I had nothing to do with that since I left before that massive growth. I left Google to start a very early data infrastructure company. That was called Mixer Labs, was the company name, GeoAPI was the product name. That was acquired by Twitter. Twitter bought us when Twitter was about 90 people. Then my job quickly became one of helping the company scale from 90 people to 1,500 people over two 1/2 years. The prior super growth journey I had before that was actually joined Google at around 1,500, 2,000 people, and it hit 15,000 people over three 1/2 years. Very rapid growth when something's actually working. Then I left Twitter to start another company, called Color Genomics, which is a big data meets genomics company that's raised about $150 million in venture capital, and is up and running still here in Burlingame.

-是的，所以我在2004年加入了Google，并在那里有效地启动了移动团队。我帮助购买了Android，并为Google Mobile Maps和Mobile Gmail组建了早期团队，这两家公司都拥有数亿用户，但自从我离开谷歌之前，我就没有做过任何事情。我离开谷歌，创办了一家非常早期的数据基础设施公司。那叫Mixer实验室，是公司名称，GeoAPI是产品名称。这是Twitter收购的。推特在我们90岁的时候买下了我们。然后，我的工作很快就变成了帮助公司在两年半的时间里从90人扩大到1500人的工作。我之前的超级增长之旅实际上是以1，500，2，000人的速度加入谷歌的，在3/2年的时间里，它的人数达到了15，000人。当某些东西真的起作用时，它会非常迅速的增长。然后我离开Twitter，创办了另一家公司，名为“色彩基因组学”，这是一家大型数据相遇基因组公司，它筹集了约1.5亿美元的风险投资，目前仍在伯林加梅运营。

- Finally made use of your Ph.D in biology.

-终于利用了你的生物学博士学位。

- Yeah.

-是啊

- Thankfully. You're an interesting mix of big company guy and small company guy. How do you think of yourself? That's sort of unusual, isn't it?

谢天谢地你是一个有趣的混合大公司的人和小公司的人。你觉得自己怎么样？这有点不寻常，不是吗？

- Yeah, I guess I think of myself as somebody who is good at operating teams or driving efforts. It could be a five-person team or it could be a multi-hundred-person team. That's my self-actualization of what I do. I actually think there's a lotta people who drop in and out of big companies and startups in terms of they start a company, maybe it gets acquired, they run a division. They maybe go and start another company or they become an investor. If you look at Silicon Valley, it's littered with people who've done this back and forth. Ben Horowitz would be a good example. Joined a company, which was Netscape. It went public. He then started a company, it got acquired by HP, ran a big division at HP, and then co-founded Andreessen Horowitz. That was a related career path in terms of somebody who bounced between the people.

-是的，我想我认为自己是一个善于团队运作或努力驾驶的人。它可以是一个五人团队，也可以是一个多人团队。这就是我所做的事情的自我实现。实际上，我认为有很多人在大公司和初创企业中进进出出，他们创办了一家公司，也许它被收购了，他们经营着一个部门。他们可能会去创办另一家公司，或者成为一名投资者。如果你看看硅谷，就会发现到处都是这样的人。本·霍洛维茨就是个很好的例子。加入了一家叫做网景的公司。公开了。然后，他创办了一家公司，被惠普收购，在惠普经营着一个大部门，然后联合创立了安德森-霍洛维茨(AndreessenHorowitz)。这是一个相关的职业道路的人谁跳之间的人。

- It kinda puts a lie to the trope that you have to fire the entrepreneur. You're either an entrepreneur, or you're a big company person. But it's not quite so simple, is it?

-这是对你必须解雇企业家的谎言。你要么是个企业家，要么是个大公司的人。但并不是很简单，对吧？

- Yeah, I think it's a good point because I think there was a real shift when Mark Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg as COO, and to people saying that founders can keep going. Because what happened in the '90s was founders were quickly replaced by professional CEOs if they raised any venture capital because often the venture capitalists would take over the board pretty quickly, often at the Series A. What that meant is that founders were often demoted. They'd bring in an old gray-haired person to run the thing. I think that really shifted in the era of Zuckerberg, where suddenly people said, "Wow, you can build massive companies "with the founder CEO still driving it." If you actually looked at the history of the biggest technology companies, that was always true. Intel was always driven by its founders. Microsoft was always driven by its founders. At least early on, first 10, 20 years. Dell was driven by its founder. Anecdotally, actually, founder CEOs worked really well, especially if they're able to main control and not raise external capital, or if they raise it on very good terms where they didn't give up control. But the second they gave up control in the '90s, they'd be out.

-是的，我认为这是一个很好的观点，因为我认为马克·扎克伯格雇佣谢丽尔·桑德伯格担任首席运营官的时候发生了真正的转变，人们说创始人可以继续前进。因为90年代发生的事情是创始人很快被专业CEO所取代，如果他们筹集任何风险资本，因为风险资本家通常会很快接管董事会，通常是在A系列，这意味着创始人经常被降职。他们会让一个白发老人来管理这件事。我认为这在扎克伯格时代发生了真正的变化，当时人们突然间说：“哇，你可以建立一个庞大的公司”，而创始人首席执行官还在驾驶着它。如果你真的看了一下最大的科技公司的历史，那是真的。英特尔总是受到创始人的推动。微软总是受到创始人的推动。至少在早期，前10，20年。戴尔是由其创始人驱动的。事实上，实际上，创始人CEO们运作得很好，尤其是如果他们能够主要控制而不是筹集外部资本的话，或者如果他们在没有放弃控制权的情况下以非常好的条件筹集资金的话。但是当他们在90年代放弃控制的时候，他们就会出局。

- Like Steve Jobs.

-就像史蒂夫·乔布斯

- Steve Jobs. The founders of Yahoo didn't run the company. The founders of eBay didn't run the company. You can go through all the major companies in the '90s. Founders of Google had Eric Schmidt come in. Up until the Zuck moment, I think, it wasn't a very common practice.

-史蒂夫·乔布斯雅虎的创始人并没有经营这家公司。eBay的创始人并没有经营这家公司。你可以在90年代查看所有的大公司。谷歌的创始人让埃里克·施密特进来。直到扎克时刻，我认为这并不是一种很普遍的做法。

- Most of the folks here in Startup School are in very, very early-stage companies. Let's talk about what it's like in the early stage, if you can think back to Mixer Labs and even Color. You were the CEO of both those companies. How did you think about what should have most of your attention during that time?

-创业学校的大部分人都是在非常、非常早期的公司工作。让我们来谈谈早期的情况，如果你能回想一下混合实验室，甚至颜色。你是这两家公司的首席执行官。在这段时间里，你是如何思考什么才是你最关注的？

- I think the singular thing that really matters is product/market fit. Building something that customers then want. That's really, honestly, the only thing that truly, truly matters. Now to get there, it means you have to hire people, unless you can build it all yourself and sell it all yourself. It means that you have to raise money if you can't fund it off of your customers, or if you can't just bootstrap it. But when all is said and done, you need to build and sell product. In the very early days, that's really the core thing.

-我认为真正重要的是产品/市场的契合。建造顾客想要的东西。老实说，这是唯一真正重要的事情。现在要做到这一点，这意味着你必须雇佣一些人，除非你可以自己动手建造，然后自己把它全部卖掉。这意味着，如果你不能从你的客户那里筹集资金，或者你不能仅仅引导它，你就必须筹集资金。但是，当一切都说了，做了，你需要建立和销售产品。在早期，这才是真正的核心。

- We've talked a lot about product/market fit and finding product/market fit in Startup School. One of the most common questions that everyone asks is, how do you know when ya have it? It's not so obvious, it seems.

-我们在创业学校讨论了很多关于产品/市场匹配和寻找产品/市场适合的问题。每个人问的最常见的问题之一是，你怎么知道什么时候有？似乎没那么明显。

- Yeah, I think it's obvious if you think about it the right way, but I think it's very hard otherwise. I'll give you three examples of signs that you have product/market fit from three different companies. If your product is broken and people are still using it very actively, or you have high retention on a broken product, that's a clear sign of product/market fit. When Twitter was constantly going down in the fail whale days, and yet nobody moved off of Twitter, that was a sign of just raw market adoption. A second sign is if you're a SaaS company and you have major brands finding and using you organically and paying for your product, that's a sign of product/market fit. Examples of that would be PagerDuty, which had, I think, Apple as an early customer. There's Zeppelin, which had, I think, Facebook using them very early. Airtable has all sorts of brands that have just sort of adopted it. I think there's a number of more recent breakouty companies where big brands are just showing up and starting to pay. I think that's a clear sign of product/market fit. The last one is just whether you have very strong customer feedback, even from a small group of people. At Color, for example, very early on, we were getting effectively love letters from our customers. The company, Color, it started off focused on providing people with information about their hereditary risk of certain genetically driven cancers. We were getting emails from people where they were saying, "Thank you so much "for helping me, for making this affordable."

-是的，我认为如果你用正确的方式去想，那是很明显的，但我认为，如果不是这样的话，那是很难的。我会给你三个例子，说明你有三个不同的公司的产品/市场适合。如果你的产品坏了，人们仍然非常积极地使用它，或者你对破损的产品有很高的保留率，这是产品/市场适合的明显标志。当Twitter在失败的鲸鱼时代不断下滑，但没有人退出Twitter的时候，这只是市场采用的一个信号。第二个标志是，如果你是一家SaaS公司，并且你有主要的品牌在有机地发现和使用你，并且为你的产品付费，那就是产品/市场适合的标志。这方面的例子就是PagerTask，我认为苹果是早期的客户。还有齐柏林飞艇，我认为，Facebook很早就开始使用它们了。Airtable有各种各样的品牌刚刚采用了它。我认为最近有一些不稳定的公司，大品牌刚刚出现并开始付费。我认为这是产品/市场适合的明显标志。最后一个问题就是你是否有很强的客户反馈，即使是来自一小群人。例如，在色彩公司，我们很早就收到了客户的情书。这家名为Color的公司一开始就致力于向人们提供有关其遗传风险的信息。我们收到了来自人们的电子邮件，他们说：“非常感谢你帮助我，让我负担得起。”

- For saving their lives.

-因为他救了他们的命。

- For saying their lives. In some cases, they felt that Color had helped with that. We got very strong customer feedback very early on.

-说出了他们的生命。在某些情况下，他们觉得色彩对此有所帮助。我们很早就得到了很强的客户反馈。

- It seems like it's some mix of, and, again, I think some of this is intuition, but some mix of retention, customer feedback, and maybe you should break your product and see if people keep on using it.

-这似乎是某种混合，而且，我认为，再次，我认为这是直觉，但一些混合保留，客户的反馈，也许你应该打破你的产品，看看人们是否继续使用它。

- I think there's other metrics, too. For example, people tend to discount growth off of small bases, even though the growth is compounding. If you're growing organically 20% a month, even if you're going from 100 to 120 users, that is a real sign of product/market fit that a lot of people tend to ignore and not believe, because they're like, oh, the numbers are small. It doesn't matter. But if you're consistently adding 20 people and then 30 people and then 40 people month after month, that's usually a sign that a thing is really gonna work.

-我认为还有其他指标.例如，尽管增长是复合的，但人们倾向于从小基数上折算增长。如果你每月有机地增长20%，即使你的用户从100人增加到120人，这是一个真正的产品/市场契合的迹象，很多人往往忽视而不相信，因为他们就像，哦，数字很小。无所谓但是，如果你不断增加20人，然后30人，然后每月40人，这通常是一个信号，一件事情真的会成功。

- This is a while ago, but what went wrong, or what goes wrong, for companies during this phase when they're trying to find product/market fit?

-这是一段时间以前的事了，但在这一阶段，当公司试图寻找合适的产品/市场时，它们到底出了什么问题，或者哪里出了问题？

- Yeah, I think almost everything you can imagine can go wrong. If you don't have product/market fit, that may or may not derail the company. If you have product/market fit, then it kinda matters less, although you still wanna correct those things. I think, for example, at Mixer Labs, the very first product was a wrong product. We initially started off building almost like content aggregation sites or wikis for locations. Then we quickly morphed it into an infrastructure product, where we were selling infrastructure to enable geolocation applications. This was before there was a big wave of API companies, and so it was one of the first, alongside things like Twilio or some of the really early developer tool companies. But the starting point for the product was much more of a consumer site that allowed you to aggregate content. We built out very deep infrastructure for that. Then we decided that really what we should be doing is selling the infrastructure. That was a good example of us changing direction as a startup.

-是的，我认为你能想到的几乎所有事情都可能出错.如果你没有适合的产品/市场，这可能会或不会使公司脱轨。如果你有适合的产品/市场，那就不那么重要了，尽管你仍然想纠正这些事情。例如，我认为，在Mixer实验室，第一个产品是错误的。我们一开始就开始构建类似于内容聚合站点或站点的wiki。然后我们迅速地将它转变成一个基础设施产品，在那里我们销售基础设施来启用地理定位应用程序。这是在API公司大潮之前，因此它是第一批，除了Twilio或一些真正早期的开发工具公司。但是，该产品的起点更多的是一个允许您聚合内容的消费网站。我们为此建立了非常深的基础设施。然后我们决定，我们真正应该做的是出售基础设施。这是我们作为一家初创公司改变方向的一个很好的例子。

- What else have you seen go wrong at this early stage that might be instructive? Whether around product/market fit, the folks you hire, even the business moves, the marketing moves you might make early on?

-在这个早期阶段，你还看到了哪些可能具有启发性的错误？无论是围绕产品/市场的适合，你雇佣的人，甚至是业务的移动，你可能在早期的营销活动？

- Yeah, I think on the hiring side, a lotta people will let not great people stick around for far too long. At my first startup, we actually let somebody go within the first month, one of our first six or seven employees. The person was great and they did well in their career after, but it just wasn't a good fit relative to what we were looking for as a company at the time. I think there's a old adage that you should either hire extremely well or fire very well. Optimal, you do both. I think a lotta people tolerate a bad hire for way too long. They'll wait six, seven, eight months, and say, hey, we have to give 'em another chance, another chance. But really, you wanna have an initial feedback conversation, see if they react, maybe have one more. Then you have to take action. I think the way you should think about your startup, from a hiring perspective, is it's almost like a life raft. Your boat is sinking, and you're on this little raft. There's five spots. Who are in those five spots? If the people on the raft aren't the five people that you should have on the raft, you should find the five people because you can only support so much from a burn perspective or a productivity perspective or a coordination perspective. I think that's a very important mindset to be in, in terms of who's on your team.

-是的，我认为在招聘方面，很多人不会让优秀的人呆太久。在我的第一次创业中，我们实际上在第一个月内就让某人离开了，这是我们最初的六七个员工中的一个。这个人很棒，之后他们的职业生涯也做得很好，但相对于我们当时作为一家公司来说，这并不是一个很好的选择。我认为有句老话说，你要么雇用得非常好，要么炒得很好。最佳，你两者都做。我认为很多人会容忍糟糕的雇佣期太长了。他们会等六、七、八个月，然后说，嘿，我们得再给他们一次机会，再给他们一次机会。但实际上，你想要进行一次初步的反馈谈话，看看他们是否有反应，也许还会有一次。那你就得采取行动。我认为，从招聘的角度来看，你应该如何看待自己的创业公司，就像一只救生筏。你的船在下沉，你在这个小木筏上。有五个点。谁在这五个地方？如果木筏上的人不是你在木筏上应有的五个人，你应该找到这五个人，因为你只能从燃烧的角度、生产力的角度或协调的角度来支持这五个人。我认为这是一个非常重要的心态，在你的球队里。

- This might be a hard question to answer, but I was thinking about a lotta times we focus on what goes wrong. A lotta things go wrong. You guys have seen out there, things go wrong. You've invested in so many epic companies. Your companies have done great. What goes right in those? What stands out as a set of things that people are doing, or steps they're taking, that kind of gives you that clue that this might be one of those great companies?

-这可能是一个很难回答的问题，但我在想很多时候我们都在关注哪里出了问题。很多事情都出了问题。你们已经看到了，事情出了问题。你投资了这么多史诗般的公司。你的公司做得很好。这里面是怎么回事？什么是人们正在做的一系列事情，或者他们正在采取的步骤，这给你提供了这样的线索：这可能是一家伟大的公司？

- Yeah, I think the focus on customers and what customers need very early is an important signal. Then I think building something immediately is really important, too. Now that doesn't mean you shouldn't be doing analysis. You should absolutely be thinking about the market. You should be thinking about your market strategy. You should be asking who your customers are and defining out your segments. But you should also just build stuff and try it, and start to see reactions rapidly. I think where I've seen a lot of people fail is they wait and wait and wait, in terms of actually building something. Sometimes they just wait too long. Or you see these companies that stay in stealth mode for three, four years. You're like, that's a terrible sign because you're not actually getting real customer feedback, potentially.

-是的，我认为对客户的关注和客户很早就需要什么是一个重要的信号。那么，我认为立即建立一些东西也是非常重要的。这并不意味着你不应该做分析。你绝对应该考虑市场。你应该考虑一下你的市场策略。你应该问你的客户是谁，并确定你的细分。但你也应该建立一些东西，并尝试它，并开始看到反应迅速。我想我见过很多人失败的地方是他们在等待和等待，实际上是在建造一些东西。有时候他们等得太久了。或者你看到这些公司在秘密模式下呆了三四年。你可能会说，这是个糟糕的信号，因为你实际上并没有得到真正的客户反馈。

- It seems like there's also something about iterating fast in these great companies, where there's always something new and better. It's always better, too.

-在这些伟大的公司里，似乎也有一些关于快速迭代的东西，在那里总是有一些新的、更好的东西。也总是更好。

- Yeah, I think that's definitely true. The other thing I've seen some people do, which I think actually helps a lot, is from day one, they focus on the velocity of the team. They maybe focus on the built environment early, and making it so that anybody can run a full instance of the product with a single line of code just to set it up. There are actually things that you can do to make your team dramatically more productive that a lotta people don't do. Anytime they onboard somebody, it takes 'em two weeks to get the damn thing running on their laptop, instead of actually saying how do we make it so that any incremental person who hires or anytime we push a change, we can instantly see its effect? I think there's almost like little things you can do along the way there, too.

-是的，我认为这绝对是真的.我看到一些人做的另一件事，我认为这是非常有帮助的，从第一天开始，他们就专注于团队的速度。他们可能会早期关注构建的环境，这样任何人都可以用一行代码来运行产品的完整实例来设置它。实际上，你可以做一些事情来使你的团队更有效率，而很多人却不这么做。每当他们上船时，他们都要花两周的时间才能在他们的笔记本上运行这该死的东西，而不是说我们是怎么做到的，这样任何增量的员工或者任何我们推动变革的人，我们都能立即看到它的效果？我认为，在这个过程中，你也可以做一些小事情。

- Yeah, since almost all of the companies that we're talking to are driven by human capital, people don't pay enough attention to making that human capital as effective and efficient as possible. Speaking of human capital, you were CEO in both your companies. In fact, you've given a lot of advice to CEOs, both as an investor and in High Growth Handbook, but later on, you're advising CEOs and other executives how to be most effective. How do you think about that for early-stage startups?

-是的，因为我们所讨论的几乎所有的公司都是由人力资本驱动的，所以人们没有足够的注意力去使人力资本尽可能的有效和高效。说到人力资本，你是两家公司的首席执行官。事实上，你给首席执行官们提供了很多建议，无论是作为投资者还是在“高增长手册”中，但后来，你建议首席执行官和其他高管如何提高效率。对于早期创业公司，你是怎么想的？

- Yeah, I think for an early-stage startup, ultimately, the focus should be on how do you make your team as effective as possible, if you have a team. Effective means two things. One is people are all moving in the same direction, and there's clear goals and there's a clear sense of what you're actually building and why. But also it means, to your point, iterating quickly. It means talking to customers early. It means, again, focusing on product/market fit because I think the mistake that people make is you could have the happiest, most wonderful group of people in the world, but if you never find product/market fit, your company is gonna die because you're just not gonna have the revenue to support it or the cash to support it, or you won't be able to raise more money. Whether you have kombucha or not is secondary to just building something that people really want. I think people get distracted along the entrepreneurial journey, either in terms of eventually if they get funded and they get invited to all these events, and all these other things start to distract them. There's a lot of entrepreneurial distractions that could get your attention, when really the core thing is are people buying your product and at what scale, and are you growing that at a good rate? Now that's if your on the venture track and you want truly a high-growth breakout company. There's all sorts of other startups you could start. You could start a lifestyle business, and that could be great. There's a variety of different reasons to do a startup. Part of it, too, is asking yourself what do you actually care about as a founder, and what's your objective? Then are your actions actually mapping against those objective? I think too many people just go on a default path that isn't the right path for them.

-是的，我认为对于早期创业来说，最重要的是，如果你有一个团队，你应该关注如何使你的团队尽可能有效。有效意味着两件事。一是人们都在朝着同一个方向前进，有着明确的目标，清楚地意识到你实际上在建立什么，以及为什么。但这也意味着，在你的观点上，快速迭代。这意味着要早点和顾客交谈。这又意味着，关注产品/市场，因为我认为人们犯的错误是，你可以拥有世界上最快乐、最棒的一群人，但如果你永远找不到合适的产品/市场，你的公司就会倒闭，因为你没有足够的收入来支持它，也没有钱来支持它，否则你就不能筹集更多的钱了。无论你是否有康普茶，都是次要的，仅仅是建立一些人们真正想要的东西。我认为人们在创业之旅中会分心，或者是因为他们最终得到了资助，他们被邀请参加所有这些活动，而所有其他的事情开始分散他们的注意力。有很多让你分心的创业精神，而真正的核心是人们购买你的产品，规模有多大，你是否在以一个很好的速度增长呢？现在，这是如果你在冒险轨道上，你想要一个真正的高增长突破公司。还有很多其他的创业公司可以开始。你可以开始一个生活方式的生意，这可能是很棒的。创业有很多不同的原因。其中的一部分，也是问自己，作为一个创始人，你真正关心的是什么，你的目标是什么？那么，你的行动实际上是与这些目标相对应的吗？我认为太多的人只是走了一条不适合他们的默认路径。

- What should a CEO be spending most of their time doing?

-首席执行官应该把大部分时间花在做什么？

- I think it differs, early versus late. For an early company, it's gonna be building. Are you actually helping to build the product? You may not be the person that should be building the product. I'm saying if it's one or two of you, you're probably building or selling. Second is hiring, and making sure that the team is productive and focused on the right direction. Then third, making sure that you don't run out of money. Lastly, it's avoiding fights with your co-founders and things like that. I often say that an early-stage startup largely fails for three reasons, or it only has to do three things. One is you need to find product/market fit, which is incredibly hard. You need to make sure that you have the money to survive. You need to not fight with your co-founder 'cause that'll slow everything down. For an early-stage startup, that's ultimately everything you need to do. You need to hire, and there's different aspects of selling that you really need to focus on, selling investors, selling customers, selling hires. But it's either build or sell. For a late-stage company, it gets way more complicated. You're still selling for all sorts of reasons, but then you're also much more focused on how do I enable this thing to scale in terms of processes, in terms of people? How do I hire executives? How do I internationalize? How do I launch new products? How do I buy companies? Then you realize quickly that that has to be a team effort because no one person can do all those things. Then you really start asking, okay, how do I build out and manage a really effective team?

-我认为这是不同的，早晚有区别。对于一家早期的公司来说，这将是一座建筑。你真的在帮助开发这个产品吗？你可能不是应该制造产品的人。我是说，如果是你们中的一个或两个，你们可能是在建造或出售。第二是招聘，并确保团队富有成效，并专注于正确的方向。第三，确保你的钱不会用完。最后，它是避免与你的联合创始人和诸如此类的争吵。我经常说，早期的初创公司失败主要有三个原因，或者它只需要做三件事。一个是你需要找到合适的产品/市场，这是难以置信的困难。你需要确保你有足够的钱来生存。你不需要和你的联合创始人吵架，因为那样会拖慢一切。对于早期创业来说，这最终是你需要做的一切。你需要雇佣，而你真正需要关注的销售有不同的方面，销售投资者，销售客户，销售员工。但要么建要么卖。对于一家后期公司来说，情况要复杂得多。你仍然为了各种各样的原因而销售，但是你也更加关注如何让这个东西在过程和人的层面上进行扩展？我该怎么雇主管？我如何国际化？如何推出新产品？我如何收购公司？然后你很快意识到，这必须是一个团队的努力，因为没有一个人能够做所有这些事情。然后你真的开始问，好吧，我如何建立和管理一个真正有效的团队？

- One of the hard roles that a CEO has, I suppose, is to figure out when you don't have product/market fit, whether ya need to tweak the product or you need to do more of a pivot. You mentioned that at Mixer Labs, you guys had to do a pivot. A lotta people ask that question. How do ya know? When do you know that you've hit the wall with what you're doing, and you need to do a more significant shift?

-我想，CEO最难的角色之一就是弄清楚你什么时候不适合产品/市场，你是需要调整产品，还是需要做更多的重点工作。你说过在Mixer实验室，你们必须做一个枢轴。很多人问这个问题。你怎么知道？你什么时候知道你正在做的事情已经碰壁了，你需要做一个更重要的转变？

- It's really hard because most startups build something for six months to a year. They launch it, and then they hit a wall. Then the question is is that a real wall or is that a fake wall? I think it's incredibly hard to know. I think if you're three, four years into something and you're just not seeing any traction or momentum, you've clearly waited too long. There's counterexamples to that, and there are always gonna be counterexamples. For example, TomTom, the European GPS company that ended up for a while being one of the most valuable companies in Europe, I think it was literally four people in a room for six years iterating through different ideas until they came up with the concept of doing GPSes, which, of course, now are subsumed by phones. But they took a really long time to get there. Most of the companies that I've seen work tend to work early, at least in terms of adoption or at least in terms of some core metrics. I think it's possible that in today's environment, where capital is really loose, people actually wait too long to pivot or to shut down because they can keep raising more money. I actually think that's a bad thing 'cause it's locking up great people at the height of their creative point in their lives, and preventing them from going and doing something else. I do think at some point, you need to have that really frank assessment. Maybe you do it periodically, but should we really keep going? Then if we're gonna keep going, I think the key question is when you pivot, the one thing I would advocate is being willing to restart completely because typically when people pivot, they pivot within the same market versus across markets. If you're in a bad market, that means you're gonna die. 'cause you're just gonna go on to the next thing. You say, hey, we have all this sunk cost. You start iterating on that new thing, and it doesn't work, either.

-这真的很难，因为大多数创业公司都会在六个月到一年的时间里建立一些东西。他们发射了它，然后撞到了墙上。那么问题是那是一堵真正的墙还是一堵假墙？我觉得很难知道。我认为，如果你已经做了三四年的事情，而你并没有看到任何牵引力和动力，那么你显然已经等了太久了。这是有反例的，而且总会有反例的。例如，TomTom，一家欧洲GPS公司，最终成为了欧洲最有价值的公司之一，我认为这实际上是四个人在一个房间里工作了六年，反复思考不同的想法，直到他们想出了做GPS的概念，当然，现在已经被手机包括在内了。但他们花了很长时间才到那里。我看到的大多数公司倾向于早期工作，至少在采用方面，或者至少在一些核心指标方面。我认为，在资本非常宽松的今天，人们可能会等待太久才能转向或关闭，因为他们可以继续筹集更多资金。我真的认为这是一件坏事，因为它把伟大的人锁在他们生命中最具创造力的地方，阻止他们去做其他的事情。我确实认为，在某一时刻，你需要有一个非常坦率的评估。也许你会定期这样做，但我们真的应该继续吗？如果我们要继续下去，我认为关键的问题是何时转向，我主张的一件事是愿意完全重启，因为通常当人们转向时，他们在同一个市场内而不是在整个市场。如果你在一个糟糕的市场，那就意味着你会死。因为你要继续做下一件事你说，嘿，我们有这么多沉没成本。你开始迭代那个新的东西，它也不起作用。

- It's sort of still decision between an evaluation of the market being bad versus it's just you have the wrong product. Could be great market and bad product.

-在对市场的评价是糟糕的还是你有错误的产品之间，这仍然是一种决定。可能是很棒的市场和不好的产品。

- You should assess it from first principles. Then if you decide that you're done with the business, you have three options: you shut it down, you sell or you pivot. If you sell, my suggestion would be sell to somebody that's clearly breaking out.

-你应该从首要原则来评估它。然后，如果你决定你的生意结束了，你有三个选择：你关闭它，你出售或者你转向。如果你卖了，我的建议就是卖给一个明显的人。

- I think I've heard you say before that, speaking of being at a great market, that that's sort of your fundamental test, if you believe that there's this incredible market opportunity, you wanna be in there. You wanna be fighting that fight. Even if you don't have the right product at first, you can find it.

-我想我之前听你说过，说到在一个伟大的市场，这是你的基本考验，如果你相信有这个难以置信的市场机会，你想要在那里。你想打这场仗。即使你一开始没有合适的产品，你也能找到它。

- Yeah, I think the singular determinant of startup success is the market. It's not the strength of the team. I think a lotta people talk about how great teams will always figure it out. I've seen great team after great team in a terrible market just die 'cause they're in a bad market, so they never have the opportunity or the time to really figure it out, or to iterate as much as they could, if they were in a very good market where there's just cash inflows hitting you, despite what you're doing. Andy Rachleff, one of the founders of Benchmark, has what some people now call Rachleff's law, which is great team, terrible market, market wins. It doesn't matter how good the team is if the market's awful. Terrible team, great market, market wins. You could actually be not very good at what you're doing, and still do very well. Your product's 1/2 broken, but it's still getting massive adoption because you're in a great market. Then there's great team, great market. Something magical happens, which is like a Google or Facebook, where you have people who then executed, they added new product lines, and they were really great at what they were doing, in terms of scaling it to the next level. I do think that's very true. I've seen many, many great teams just die in a terrible market. Then I've seen a few bad teams do very well. That, to me, was very surprising. It feels very non-egalitarian or merit based.

-是的，我认为决定创业成功的唯一因素是市场。这不是团队的力量。我想很多人都在谈论伟大的球队是如何解决问题的。我见过一支又一支伟大的团队在糟糕的市场中死去，因为他们在一个糟糕的市场上，所以他们从来没有机会或时间去真正解决这个问题，或者尽可能多地迭代，如果他们在一个非常好的市场上，不管你在做什么，只有现金流入你。Benchmark的创始人之一AndyRachleff，拥有一些人现在所说的Rachleff定律，即伟大的团队，糟糕的市场，市场的胜利。如果市场糟糕的话，球队有多好并不重要。糟糕的团队，伟大的市场，市场胜利。实际上，你可能并不擅长你正在做的事情，而且仍然做得很好。你的产品坏了1/2，但它仍然被大量采用，因为你在一个伟大的市场。然后是伟大的团队，伟大的市场。一些神奇的事情发生了，就像Google或者Facebook，在那里，人们会执行，他们增加了新的产品线，他们做的非常好，把它扩展到更高的水平。我确实认为这是真的。我见过很多伟大的球队在糟糕的市场中死去。然后我看到了一些糟糕的球队做得很好。对我来说，这是非常令人惊讶的。这感觉非常不平等或功绩为基础。

- Why do you think it is that so many teams choose such bad markets?

-你认为为什么这么多球队选择如此糟糕的市场？

- I think it's maybe three reasons. One is sometimes people just jump into things and they just start building without actually thinking it through. Sometimes that works really well 'cause it's a product you want or need, and so you're building it for everybody else. But sometimes it's something that has been tried many, many times before, and that doesn't mean it won't work in the future, but maybe you should look at the history and ask why didn't it work? What should I be doing differently versus just doing the same thing again that's failed five times? The second thing I've seen a lotta people fail at is what I call multi-miracle startups. I think every startup needs at least one miracle to succeed because if it was obvious that it was gonna work, everybody would already be doing it. You wouldn't have an opportunity. In some sense, startups only have opportunities in markets that are non-obvious, which means they have to overcome some obstacle. The distribution needs to magically work, or the product and the price point need to magically to work, or whatever it is. But there's some companies where they come up with two miracles for their startup. They say, "Our stage one of the startup "is we're gonna do X. "Then stage Y is we're gonna do this other thing "that's completely unrelated, but because we did X, "we can suddenly do Y." Usually those fail because you're saying, well, you have two miracles, and you're compounding very low probabilities, so you're just bound to fail. An example would be there was an era where people said that the way to compete with Yelp was to start an events product, which was in open space, win in events, and then it's adjacent enough to what Yelp does that you could add local listings, and then you'd win in local listings. That's a terrible approach. You should say either I wanna win in events, and just double down on that, or I wanna go after listings, and then I'm just gonna do that. But this multi-step thing tends to fail.

-我想大概有三个原因其中之一是人们有时只是跳进事物中，他们只是在没有真正思考的情况下就开始建设。有时候这很有效，因为它是你想要或需要的产品，所以你为其他人建造它。但是有时候，它已经被尝试了很多次了，但这并不意味着它在将来不起作用，但是也许你应该回顾一下历史，并问它为什么不起作用？我应该做什么不同的事情，而只是做同样的事情，再次失败了五次？我看到很多人失败的第二件事是我所说的多奇迹创业公司。我认为每一家初创公司都需要至少一个奇迹才能成功，因为如果很明显，它会成功，那么每个人都会这么做。你就没有机会了。从某种意义上说，初创企业在市场上的机会并不明显，这意味着它们必须克服一些障碍。分销需要神奇的工作，或产品和价格点需要神奇地工作，或任何东西。但是有些公司为他们的创业创造了两个奇迹。他们说，“我们创业的第一阶段”是我们要做的X。“那么阶段Y是我们要做的另一件事”，这是完全无关的，但因为我们做了X，“我们可以突然做Y。”通常这些失败是因为你说，嗯，你有两个奇迹，而且你的概率很低，所以你注定会失败。举个例子，有一个时代，人们说和Yelp竞争的方法是创建一个活动产品，它在开放的空间中，在活动中获胜，然后它足够接近Yelp所做的事情，你可以添加本地列表，然后在本地列表中获胜。这是个糟糕的方法。你应该说，要么我想在比赛中获胜，然后加倍努力，要么我想去找名单，然后我就这么做。但是这个多步骤的东西往往会失败。

- Which is, I think, an abject lesson in how not to approach your investor meetings. If you're talking to an investor, and you have a whole bunch of miracles that have to happen before you're a big company, then that investor's probably not gonna be that interested.

-我认为，这是如何不参加投资者会议的一个可鄙的教训。如果你在和一个投资者交谈，在你成为一家大公司之前，你有很多奇迹要发生，那么投资者可能就不会那么感兴趣了。

- Yeah, the most common miracle that's quoted today is data moat. People say, "Well, we'll generate tons of data, "and then we'll be differentiated." I think in genomics, something like that could work, but outside of that, I actually think I've never seen a company pull that off, in terms of a broader data is the only thing that's their asset, and then they're gonna somehow do something with that asset.

-是的，今天引用的最常见的奇迹是数据护城河。人们会说，“好吧，我们会产生大量的数据，”然后我们就会被区分开来。“我认为在基因组学中，类似的东西是可行的，但除此之外，我认为我从来没有见过一家公司能做到这一点，从更广泛的数据来看，这是他们唯一的资产，然后他们会以某种方式对这些资产做些什么。

- Yeah, or we're gonna get, our AI is gonna get the smartest 'cause we'll have the most data. Then our AI will be the best, and therefore, we'll win. Just back to the CEO question, how should teams choose their CEO? Who should be the CEO?

-是的，或者我们会得到，我们的人工智能会得到最聪明的，因为我们将拥有最多的数据。那么我们的人工智能将是最好的，因此，我们会赢。回到CEO的问题，团队应该如何选择他们的首席执行官？谁应该是首席执行官？

- It's a good question. There's different ways that you could describe or argue it. Ultimately, in some cases, it's clear. Hey, this person is the person we're choosing. In some cases, it's a huge argument. I think the most important thing is to resolve it, even if you get it wrong, 'cause you can always correct the wrong thing, but at least you have somebody in charge. I think a lot of founding teams end up with a lot of fights that then slow down the company dramatically if they don't have somebody clearly in charge. I think if it's a very technical product, it's often better to have the technologist in charge. Say that you had a businessperson and a technologist. 'Cause if it's two technologists, I don't know how to differentiate between. Maybe somebody who's a little bit better at selling or recruiting or that part of the job. Maybe that's the right person for the CEO if it's two technologists. If it's a businessperson and a technologist, usually the businessperson is gonna be better at those things, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be the CEO because often the iteration of the product and the understanding of the product is driven by the technologist. That really impacts how you sell it, how you iterate on it and the decisions that you make along the way. But honestly, I think any configuration can work. I think sometimes a founding pair will be really self-honest, and they'll just be like, oh, this person is better at the things that we need from the CEO today, which means better at recruiting, better at fundraising, better at selling, and better at setting vision and direction. Then it's a clear shot, in terms of who it should be.

-这是个好问题.你可以用不同的方式来描述或争论它。最终，在某些情况下，这是显而易见的。嘿，这个人就是我们要选的人。在某些情况下，这是一个巨大的争论。我认为最重要的是解决它，即使你弄错了，因为你总是可以纠正错误的事情，但至少你有一个负责人。我认为，许多创始团队最终会有很多争斗，如果没有明确的负责人，公司就会大幅放缓。我认为如果这是一种技术含量很高的产品，最好由技术专家来负责。说你有一个商人和一个技术专家。因为如果是两位技术人员，我不知道如何区分。也许是一个比较擅长销售或招聘的人或者是这部分工作的人。如果是两位技术人员，也许这位CEO就是合适的人选。如果是商人和技术专家，通常情况下，商人会更擅长这些事情，但这并不一定意味着他们应该是首席执行官，因为产品的迭代和对产品的理解往往是由技术人员驱动的。这真的会影响你如何销售它，如何迭代它，以及你在此过程中所做的决定。但老实说，我认为任何配置都可以工作。我想有时候一位创始人会很诚实，他们会说，哦，这个人在我们今天需要的东西上做得更好，这意味着更好的招聘，更好的筹款，更好的销售，更好的设定愿景和方向。从应该是谁的角度来看，这是一个明确的机会。

- You might even say that you should put in the position of the CEO the person who's gonna help you find product/market fit. Who's gonna drive the company to product/market fit sooner and better.

-你甚至可以说，你应该让首席执行官这个人来帮助你找到适合你的产品/市场。谁会让公司更快更好地走向产品/市场。

- Ah, that's a good point, yeah.

-啊，这是个很好的观点，是的.

- I wonder. Why were you the CEO? Because it was your idea? Because?

-我想知道.你为什么是首席执行官？因为这是你的主意？因为

- Yeah, it's interesting. For example, with Color, I stepped down as CEO after four years. The origin of the company was a bit of a mix, but ultimately, it was driven by my co-founder's personal story, where he himself is a BRCA2 carrier. His mother's had breast cancer twice. He's had members of his family die of the diseases. The company was started, in some sense, as a form of patient advocacy, where we said it's ridiculous that people can't afford and access these really important pieces of genetic information that can really drive what they should be doing, from a health perspective, in their lives. I think that--

-是的，很有趣.例如，在色彩公司，四年后，我辞去了首席执行官一职。该公司的起源有点混合，但最终，它是由我的共同创始人的个人故事，他自己是一家BRCA 2运营商。他母亲得了两次乳腺癌。他的家人死于这种疾病。从某种意义上说，这家公司是作为一种病人辩护的形式成立的，我们说，人们负担不起和获取这些真正重要的基因信息，从健康的角度来看，在他们的生活中，这是很荒谬的。我觉得-

- It's his passion and his drive more than anything.

-最重要的是他的热情和动力。

- It was his passion and drive. I had a lot of passion for it, having worked in biology and things, but fundamentally, I think one of the reasons the shift we made is so good is because this is something that he's truly lived and cares about deeply. I think that really comes through, as well, in the choices that are made in the product, of how do you think about patient data privacy and how do you think about all these things. I think he had a very deep, intuitive sense of what it would mean for him, which I think was very important in the context of what Color was doing.

-这是他的激情和动力。我对此有很大的热情，曾经在生物学和其他方面工作过，但从根本上说，我认为我们做出的转变之所以如此美好，是因为这是他真正生活并深深关心的事情。我认为，在产品中做出的选择，如何看待病人的数据隐私，以及如何看待所有这些事情，我认为这也是非常重要的。我认为他对它对他意味着什么有一种非常深刻、直观的感觉，我认为这在色彩所做的事情中是非常重要的。

- It seems like a very modern way to look at the CEO as the ultimate product advocate, Steve Jobs being the obvious example there.

-这似乎是一种非常现代的方式，将首席执行官视为最终的产品拥护者，史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)就是明显的例子。

- I think in tech, we're very imprinted on that style. But there's also great examples of CEOs who were amazing salespeople. Benioff started off in sales at I think Oracle or something. There's all sorts of examples of non-technology CEOs who've done extremely well. Or you have a situation where you do a mix. Like at Google, Eric Schmidt had a Ph.D in CS, but he'd also run Novell before and he'd run a public company. It was somebody who'd done the business side of things, as well as the technical side.

-我认为在科技界，我们对这种风格有很深的印象.但也有很好的例子，CEO都是出色的销售人员。我想是甲骨文什么的。有各种各样的非技术CEO的例子，他们做得非常好。或者你遇到了混搭的情况。和谷歌一样，埃里克·施密特(EricSchmidt)拥有CS博士学位，但他以前也经营过Novell，还经营过一家上市公司。这是做生意的人，也是技术方面的人。

- I haven't figured out whether it's a trend or not, but it seems a little bit that way. I always find I prefer, if I'm looking at investing in a company or looking at a company for YC, that a product person, that the CEO really has a feel for the product, anyway.

-我还没有弄清楚这是否是一种趋势，但似乎有点这样。我总是发现，如果我想投资一家公司或者是YC的一家公司，我更喜欢做产品的人，不管怎么说，CEO对产品有一种感觉。

- Yeah, I totally agree.

-是的，我完全同意.

- Let's transition a little bit to fundraising. We've been talking a fair amount about that recently in Startup School. Did you have interesting experiences fundraising that you can talk about in your two companies, in Mixer Labs and Color?

-让我们向筹款过渡一点。我们最近在创业学校讨论了相当多的问题。在你的两家公司，在Mixer实验室和Color，你有什么有趣的筹资经验吗？

- Sure. We took a very different fundraising strategy. For the first startup that we did, we ended up raising from, seed from a brand-name venture fund, plus a bunch of angels. Then we did a second round from a super angel or small fund group. The biggest issue we had there is we had a bad investor who, as we were exiting the company, basically tried to claw more value for themselves as part of our exit. This was a Midas List investor who's very well known now. The second company, my co--

-当然。我们采取了非常不同的筹资策略。在我们第一次创业的时候，我们从一家品牌风险基金那里筹到了种子，再加上一群天使。然后，我们做了第二轮的超级天使或小基金集团。我们面临的最大问题是，我们遇到了一个糟糕的投资者，在我们离开公司的时候，他基本上试图为自己争取更多的价值，作为我们退出公司的一部分。这是一位名叫米达斯的名单投资者，现在已经很出名了。第二家公司，我的合作伙伴-

- So hang on. This is a successful investor who tried to screw other people over while they?

所以坚持住这是一位成功的投资者，他试图在别人身上捣乱？

- Yeah.

-是啊

- Huh.

-嗯

- Yeah.

-是啊

- And their name? No, don't. I shouldn't go there, I guess.

-他们的名字呢？不，不要。我想我不应该去那里。

- I'm always tempted, but I'll stop myself. But I do think that there are some brand name investors who are dicks. You should be careful in terms of who you work with. You should diligence them. Ask the founders where either things didn't go well, or where that was some issue over time, or whatever it is. That's more likely to reveal the truth about an investor than asking in a situation where everything worked.

-我总是被诱惑，但我会阻止自己的.但我确实认为有一些品牌投资者是混蛋。你应该在和谁一起工作的时候小心。你应该尽职尽责。问问创始人，无论哪种情况都不顺利，或者，随着时间的推移，这是什么问题，或者是什么问题。这更有可能揭示投资者的真实情况，而不是在一切正常的情况下询问。

- We like to say at YC that being nice is a big advantage, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes it's not true.

-我们喜欢在YC说友好是一个很大的优势，但它并不总是有效的。有时候这不是真的。

- I think I would differentiate between two things. I think you want investors who will push you, or question what you're doing maybe is a better way to phrase it because I do see some founders sometimes uncomfortable with being asked about some of their decisions. You should be asked about your decisions. That's the way to get better. It may be a naive question that an investor asks, but that may be the thing that makes you think about something that you should be doing differently, or maybe it just reaffirms what you're doing is right. I would differentiate between that and somebody acting badly, in terms of clawing value for themselves or doing other things. We had a pool of investors. There's only one who acted badly out of a dozen people, so it's not, or 15 people or something.

-我想我要区分两件事。我认为，你希望投资者能推动你，或者质疑你在做什么-也许这是一个更好的表达方式，因为我确实看到，一些创始人有时对被问及他们的一些决定感到不自在。你应该被问及你的决定。这才是变得更好的方法。这可能是投资者提出的一个天真的问题，但它可能会让你思考一些你应该做的不同的事情，或者它只是重申了你所做的是正确的。我会把它和一些行为不端的人区分开来，比如为自己攫取价值或做其他事情。我们有很多投资者。十几个人中只有一个人表现不好，所以不是，或者是15个人什么的。

- How easy was it to raise money at Mixer Labs, your first company?

-在你的第一家公司Mixer实验室筹集资金有多容易？

- Yeah, it took us about two or three months. In general, I think you hear the news about these fund raises that happen in a week, and you think every fund raise is gonna take a week. But if you're actually being thoughtful on your side, as well, it should take a couple months because otherwise you're not getting to know the people that you're fundraising from. Usually what happens is you'll find that until somebody really tips, most people are scared to jump in, which is really weird. In general, you'll find that most investors are fear driven versus ambition driven. They're kinda scared of missing something versus really excited and believe vigorously in something. High conviction investors are actually very valuable, in my opinion.

-是的，我们花了两三个月的时间.总的来说，我认为你听到了一周内这些基金筹集的消息，你认为每一次筹资都需要一周的时间。但如果你真的在考虑自己的立场，那就需要花上几个月的时间，否则你就无法了解那些你正在筹集资金的人了。通常情况下，你会发现，直到有人真的小费，大多数人害怕跳进，这真的很奇怪。一般来说，你会发现大多数投资者是恐惧驱动的，而不是野心驱动的。他们有点害怕错过一些东西，而不是真的很兴奋，并且对某些东西充满信心。在我看来，高信念的投资者实际上是非常有价值的。

- They're few and far between. It's hard to be the first money in on a company. You have to just really believe, especially with a new founder.

-他们很少。很难成为公司的第一笔资金。你必须真的相信，尤其是和一个新的创始人在一起。

- Yeah, and a lot of investors fall for the opposite of that, which is there's a brand name investor in, and so they go in, but it's actually a bad investment because everybody makes mistakes.

-是的，很多投资者对此持相反态度，因为有一个品牌投资者，所以他们会加入，但这实际上是一项糟糕的投资，因为每个人都会犯错。

- They're sheep.

-他们是羊.

- Yeah.

-是啊

- How about with Color? You've been a successful entrepreneur already. You were a well-known executive at that point. You were sort of in a different spot raising for Color.

-颜色怎么样？你已经是个成功的企业家了。你当时是个有名的高管。你在一个不同的地方为颜色而提高。

- Yeah, I think for many founders on their second company, it's much easier 'cause they have relationships. My co-founder and I did most of our seed, and then we brought in people for the A. It was people that we'd known for a while and that we really trusted and respected. We had Joe Lonsdale and Venode from Costa Ventures come in for our A. For the seed, for Mixer Labs, we really had to network to get intros. We met Michael Deering as he was just starting to invest. We were one of the first companies he invested in. We met him through Kim Scott, who wrote the book Radical Candor. I worked with her at Google. I just asked people I know, "Who do you know "that's investing right now?" Then we ended up having Sequoia in the round, Reid Hoffman when he was still an individual, and evolved from AngelList. We had a bunch of really great people line up, but we had to network for the first few. I think it was Deering maybe who tipped first, or somebody else, and then everybody kinda catalyzed.

-是的，我认为对于第二家公司的许多创始人来说，这要容易得多，因为他们有关系。我和我的联合创始人做了我们大部分的种子，然后我们为A引进了一些人-我们认识了一段时间，我们真的信任和尊敬他们。我们让JoeLonsdale和Costa Ventures的Venode加入我们的A.为种子，对于Mixer实验室，我们真的需要网络才能得到自我介绍。我们在迈克尔·德林刚开始投资的时候见过他。我们是他最早投资的公司之一。我们是通过金·斯科特认识他的，他写了一本“彻底坦率”一书。我和她一起在谷歌工作。我只是问我认识的人，“你认识谁？”然后我们得到了红杉在轮，里德霍夫曼，当他还是一个个体，并从安吉利斯特。我们有一群真正伟大的人排成一排，但我们必须为第一批人建立网络。我想可能是德林先给了小费，或者是其他人，然后每个人都有催化作用。

- How does someone get a meeting with Elad Gil?

-怎么才能和Elad Gil见面？

- I think you make it sound like that's a valuable thing, but I think.

-我觉得你让这听起来很有价值，但我觉得.

- Well, it depends whether those companies that you invested in would have been successful without your investment. Maybe it's the most valuable thing you can get.

-这取决于如果没有你的投资，你投资的那些公司是否会成功。也许这是你能得到的最有价值的东西。

- I think that the most successful companies, in 95% of the cases, are successful despite their investors. I shouldn't say despite. I should say irregardless. Now the investors may help optimize certain things or they may bring in the key exec. I'm not trying to minimize the impact of investors. I just think product/market fit is such a raw force that it's helpful to have people around you who can help with scaling and other things. I've seen companies go the other way, where they have a lot of bad capital all the way through all their rounds, and the founders are drowning for help. You really do see a difference. I'm not saying that there isn't a difference. Actually, I know one company in particular where they had a series of initial weak investors. Their board meetings were completely ineffectual. They haven't gotten a lotta help. They haven't built out an executive team. It shows. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying to get from zero to one, it's not your investors who will do it most of the time. There are some counterexamples. I think Paul Graham helped, actually, with some of the very early ideas for Reddit.

-我认为最成功的公司，在95%的情况下，是成功的，尽管他们的投资者。我不应该说尽管。我应该说不管。现在，投资者可能会帮助优化某些事情，或者他们可能会引入关键的高管。我不是想把投资者的影响降到最低。我只是认为产品/市场的契合是如此原始的力量，所以在你身边有能够帮助你扩展和其他事情的人是很有帮助的。我见过一些公司走到了另一条路，在那里，他们拥有大量的不良资本，而且他们的创始人都在溺水寻求帮助。你确实看到了不同之处。我不是说没有区别。事实上，我知道有一家公司，特别是在那里，他们有一系列最初的弱势投资者。他们的董事会会议完全无效。他们没有得到太多的帮助。他们还没有组建一个执行团队。这说明了。我没那么说。我只是说从零到一，大部分时间都不是你的投资者做的。有一些反例。事实上，我认为保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)对Reddit的一些早期想法有所帮助。

- Airbnb, especially. But it's pretty unusual for an investor to be transformative for a company.

-特别是Airbnb。但对于一家公司来说，投资者做出变革是很不寻常的。

- Yeah.

-是啊

- So, getting that meeting?

-那么，参加那个会议？

- Oh.

-哦

- I think the best way is to get an introduction through a founder that I already know, or somebody else that I already know so that's it's in network. I think if you can't find a way to do that, then you're probably not gonna find a way to get customers, you're not gonna find a way to get hires, you're not gonna find a way to do all sorts of things. I think that's the best way.

-我认为最好的方法是通过我已经认识的创始人或者其他我已经认识的人来介绍，所以这是在网络中。我认为如果你找不到办法去做，那么你很可能就找不到找到顾客的方法，你不会找到工作的方法，你也不会找到做各种事情的方法。我觉得这是最好的办法。

- Yeah, it seems like Paul Graham's original idea of doing things that don't scale works across different domains, not just building product, but figuring out how to get to the right investor and get that first--

-是的，保罗·格雷厄姆(Paul Graham)最初提出的不按比例行事的想法，不仅适用于不同的领域，不仅是产品的开发，还包括如何找到合适的投资者，并首先得到

- Yeah, the core component of almost everything you end up doing as a startup. Hiring also is not gonna be scalable early. You're just gonna have to grind through giant lists of people. For example, at Color, because we are a CLIA/CAP lab and we're focused on the regulatory compliance of what we do, we had to hire specialists called CLSes into the lab very early because they had licenses that allowed them to operate certain types of tests. In the state of California, we could only find two or 300 CLSes total. We had to hire two or three of them. We had to hire 1% of all of these people in the state of California. We wanted to find people who were very good. If you have a license, that's very rare. It means you can get hired really easily, which doesn't necessarily mean that you're great. I literally ground through 200 people. We put 'em all in a spreadsheet. I and the recruiter I work with contacted every one of those 200 people, and had a conversation with all of 'em. You just have to grind through stuff.

-是的，作为一家初创公司，你所做的每件事的核心部分都是如此。招聘也不会提前扩展。你得仔细看一大串人名单。例如，在Color，因为我们是一个CLIA/CAP实验室，我们专注于遵守我们所做的工作，所以我们不得不很早就雇佣名为CLSes的专家进入实验室，因为他们拥有允许他们操作某些类型测试的许可证。在加州，我们只能找到两到300个CLSS总数。我们不得不雇用他们中的两三人。我们不得不雇用加州所有这些人中的1%。我们想找到那些非常优秀的人。如果你有驾照，那是非常罕见的。这意味着你可以很容易地被录用，但这并不一定意味着你很棒。我真的是从200人中钻出来的。我们把它们都放在一个电子表格里。我和我的招聘人员联系了这200人中的每一个人，并与他们所有人进行了交谈。你只需要仔细研究一下。

- It's hard work doing a startup, huh?

-创业很辛苦，是吧？

- That's why I'm taking a break.

-这就是我要休息的原因.

- There's so much I wanna talk about. We'll do a few more things, and then we'll open it up for questions. You sort of already answered this a little bit, but maybe you can elaborate on your decision process when you're looking at an investment.

-我想谈的太多了我们会做一些更多的事情，然后我们将打开它的问题。你已经回答了一点，但也许你可以在投资的时候详细说明你的决策过程。

- Yeah, I think I have three really simple criteria. They're gonna sound very generic, but I think about them deeply, hopefully. The first one is market, or product market is a better way to phrase it. Is the team building something that the product will actually want or need? There's different ways to check that. It could be something that I would use myself at my company. It could be you see clear growth or traction for something that's launched, or sometimes I'll literally call potential customers and ask them. I actually do a lot of market diligence for things I invest in, even though I'm just an angel. The second thing is are they people who are very high caliber? They can learn quickly, all the rest of it. There is the founder component, which I think is really important. I just think the market dominates that. Then lastly, if they were to call me at 10 o'clock at night on a Friday or Saturday night, would I take the call and would I be excited to talk with them? Are they good people, are they ethical, would they be easy to work with? Because life is short, and there's lots of companies that'll work. The last thing you want is a long conversation with somebody terrible.

-是的，我想我有三个非常简单的标准它们听起来很通用，但我会深思，满怀希望。第一个是市场，或者说产品市场是一个更好的表达方式。团队所构建的是产品真正想要或需要的东西吗？有不同的方法来检查。这可能是我在公司里用过的东西。它可能是你看到了明确的增长或牵引的东西已经推出，或有时我会真的打电话给潜在的客户，并询问他们。事实上，我为投资的东西做了大量的市场调查，尽管我只是个天使。第二，他们是高素质的人吗？他们学得很快，其余的都能学到。有一个创建者的组成部分，我认为这是非常重要的。我只是觉得市场主导了这一切。最后，如果他们在星期五或星期六晚上10点打电话给我，我会接电话吗？他们是好人吗？他们是合乎道德的吗？他们能很容易地一起工作吗？因为生命是短暂的，而且有很多公司会工作。你最不想和一个可怕的人长篇大论。

- That's true. What are the things you see, excuse me, companies doing wrong when they come and meet with you?

-那是真的.请问，公司来见你的时候做错了什么？

- Good question. I think it's a few things. One is not getting down to the details quickly enough. Sometimes people will have the preamble of their personal story, how when they were seven they lived in Canada. Then they were nine, then they were 11, and they started learning to write code. Then something else happened. Then eventually they came up with the idea in college, but they didn't work on it for seven years. I would just make it a very crisp, concise story. This is what we're building, this is why we're building, this is who I am. But here are the three highlights, here's who my co-founders are, here's the market that we're in, here's the product we're building. Let's show you a demo. That would be the optimal early-stage conversation 'cause the demo means they actually built something, instead of just talked about it. The quick analysis of the market slash how does this fit it or what's the use case is really important 'cause they've thought through that dynamic. Then the team, who are you, what do you care about, why are you building this is important versus I was seven in the Appalachian Mountains.

-问得好。我觉得有几件事。一个是没有足够快地深入到细节上来。有时人们会有他们个人故事的序言，他们七岁时是如何生活在加拿大的。然后他们九岁，然后他们11岁，他们开始学习写代码。然后发生了其他事情。最后，他们在大学里想出了这个主意，但他们已经七年没有研究过了。我只想让它成为一个非常清晰，简洁的故事。这就是我们要建造的，这就是我们建造的原因，这就是我。但这里有三个亮点，这是我的联合创始人，这是我们所处的市场，这是我们正在开发的产品。让我们给你看个演示。这将是最佳的早期对话，因为演示意味着他们实际上构建了一些东西，而不是仅仅谈论它。对市场暴跌的快速分析是非常重要的，因为他们已经考虑过这种动态。那么团队，你是谁，你关心的是什么，你为什么要建造这个很重要的东西，而我在阿巴拉契亚山脉只有7岁。

- Get to the point, in other words.

-直截了当，换句话说.

- Yeah, get to the point quickly. Also, make efficient use of time. If the meeting should only take 20 minutes, that's great. What I've found is that very busy people will spend more time with you if you're very efficient with their time because they don't feel that you're just gonna sit there and take up the time because they can. I've had meetings where, I'll tell you one example meeting, which I thought was amazing, and I didn't think it would happen. I was looking into funding things in antiaging or longevity-related technology. I think it's a big gap in biopharma, and I think it's important socially. There was this founder, Ben Kamens, who I met with. We had I think 45 minutes set up. We talked for 10 minutes, and at the end of 10 minutes, he said, "Okay, I got everything "I need out of you. "I'm gonna go think about this stuff, "and then I'll follow up in four days." I was like, okay, this guy's just gonna disappear. Nobody does a 10-minute meeting and actually comes back with anything useful. Then he came back in four days with this big analysis of everything that we'd discussed and what he was gonna do next and how he was gonna approach it. That was a 15, 20-minute meeting. I was like, oh, my gosh. This person is amazing. They're extremely efficient, they have amazing follow through, they say what they're gonna do and they do it. They realized that this is a multi-interaction thing. Therefore, how do I build that confidence in that person that they actually wanna keep talking to me?

-是啊，快说吧.同时，有效地利用时间。如果会议只需要20分钟，那就太好了。我发现很忙的人会花更多的时间和你在一起，如果你对他们的时间很有效率，因为他们不觉得你只是坐在那里，占用时间，因为他们可以。我有过一些会议，我会告诉你们一个例子，我认为这是令人惊奇的，而且我认为它不会发生。我在寻找抗衰老或长寿相关技术的资金来源。我认为这是一个巨大的差距在生物harma，我认为这是重要的社会。有个创办人，本·卡门，我见过他。我们已经安排了45分钟。我们聊了10分钟，在10分钟结束时，他说，“好吧，我得到了一切”我需要你。“我要去考虑这件事，”然后四天后我会跟进。“我就像，好吧，这家伙就这么消失了。没有人会开10分钟的会，然后回来拿出任何有用的东西。四天后，他又回来了，对我们讨论过的每件事都做了大量的分析，接下来他要做什么，以及他将如何处理这个问题。那是一次15，20分钟的会议。我就像，哦，我的天。这个人太棒了。他们非常有效率，他们有惊人的跟踪，他们说他们要做什么，他们做它。他们意识到这是一个多方面的互动。因此，我该如何建立他们真正想和我交谈的那个人的信心呢？

- That's a great lesson for future investors, too, huh? Act like that. I wanna turn it over for, to Q and A, but just before we do that, you just wrote a book, High Growth Handbook, which I think is a fantastic book. Maybe not so relevant to running a startup, although it seems like there's a way to track back from all the lessons in there, and it helps you think about your startup, I think, in an effective way.

-对未来的投资者来说，这也是一个很好的教训，对吧？表现得像那样。我想把它交给Q和A，但就在我们这么做之前，你刚刚写了一本书，“高增长手册”，我认为这是一本很棒的书。也许与创业没有太大关系，尽管似乎有一种方法可以从其中的所有教训中找到答案，而且它可以帮助你以一种有效的方式思考你的创业。

- Yeah, and so the book is called the High Growth Handbook. It's basically almost like a section-by-section view of a lot of the common things that happen in startups, and then tactically what to do about them. It's a very tactical book that doesn't have a lot of platitudes. Like there's nothing about A players hiring A players, which doesn't really help anybody. It's not like somebody's gonna write "I'm an A player" on their resume. But it really helps you understand, okay, you wanna build a recruiting process. What's the multi-step process you should build and how should you go about doing it? Then it's interwoven with interviews with Sam from YC and Claire Hughes Johnson from Stripe and Mark Andreessen and Reid Hoffman and Ruchi Sanghvi and a bunch of other people around their experiences operating or funding companies that are relevant to each section. There'll be a section on board, and then there'll be an interview with Reid Hoffman around what he looks for in board members. He just wrote Blitzscaling, which is sort of a really interesting book around scaling companies that I definitely recommend, as well. The interesting thing, though, is that a number of the sections in the book actually started off as blog posts on my blog. Some of them are actually targeted to early-stage founders. Some of the stuff around hiring maps into it, or some of the stuff around product management maps into it. I do think there are some things that are universal, and then some things that are completely divorced, like buying a company or raising $100 million or whatever it is are obviously for much later stages. Or doing a big reorg, thinks like that.

-是啊，所以这本书叫做“高增长手册”。从根本上说，这就像是对初创企业中发生的许多常见事情的一分为二的看法，然后在战术上对它们做些什么。这是一本很有策略的书，没有太多陈词滥调。就像没有球员雇佣球员一样，这对任何人都没有帮助。不是说有人会在简历上写“我是个好手”。但它确实帮助你理解，好吧，你想建立一个招聘程序。您应该构建的多步过程是什么，您应该如何进行呢？然后，它与来自YC的Sam和Stripe的克莱尔·休斯·约翰逊(Claire Hughes Johnson)、马克·安德烈森(Mark Andreessen)、里德·霍夫曼(Reid Hoffman)和鲁奇·桑格维(Ruchi Sanghvi)的访谈交织在一起，还有一群围绕着飞机上会有一个章节，然后会对里德·霍夫曼(Reid Hoffman)进行一次关于他在董事会成员中寻找什么的采访。他刚刚写了“闪电战”，这是一本非常有趣的关于公司规模的书，我肯定也会推荐这本书。有趣的是，这本书中的一些章节实际上是以博客的形式在我的博客上开始的。其中一些实际上是针对早期创始人的。其中一些是关于雇佣地图的东西，或者是一些关于产品管理的东西。我确实认为，有些事情是普遍的，然后有些事情是完全离婚的，比如收购一家公司，筹集1亿美元或其他任何东西，显然在以后的许多阶段都是如此。或者做一个大的重组，这样的想法。

- But the way the book's structured, it turns out it's easy to skip around. You should buy the book.

-但这本书的结构，很容易跳过。你应该买这本书。

- Wow, thanks.

哇谢谢

- And find the parts ya like. Let's open to Q and A. Questions for Elad.

找到你喜欢的部分让我们为Elad回答Q和A的问题。

- [Man] This question is about investor updates. I saw a company that has long-stage cycle, let's say four or five months. What should be the frequency for the initial update? Then what should we put in that investor update becausecustomers?

-[MAN]这个问题是关于投资者最新情况的。我看到一家公司的周期很长，比如说四五个月。初始更新的频率应该是多少？那么，我们应该在投资者最新情况报告中加入哪些内容，因为它们是投资者的支持者？

- I'll repeat the question. The question is about investor updates. How frequent should they be and what should be in them?

-我再问一遍。问题在于投资者的最新情况。他们应该有多频繁，他们应该是什么？

- Yeah, I have a blog post actually wrote on this. I think that you should do it monthly. My suggestion, in terms of the sections, would be the top section should be what are you ask from your investors, or investors and advisors, or whoever you're sending it to, so it's very clear immediately how they can help. If they don't read anything else, if they just open the email, they'll see that. You'll actually get a lotta responses to that. I think the second section could be metrics, if you have metrics. It could be sales. It could be that it's flat, and that's fine. I think burn is important to include, so how much money do you have left? Paul Graham often advocates for default dead or default alive. Are you gonna run outta money at some point or not? I often just phrase it similarly as how many months of cash do you have left and how much are you burning. Then you can have updates around team, around market, et cetera. Product, did you launch anything new? Press, did you get any? I think you can follow that. The reason I think monthly is important is you wanna create a high enough frequency that your investors are thinking about you and that they feel that they're up to speed on things, but not so much that it overwhelms you or them. I think monthly is a nice cadence. At Color, we started sending out investor updates really early. I'd call up an investor and I'd start to give them background in terms of what's been happening. They'd say, "No, no, I read your update. "I know what's going on. "Let's jump straight to it." By being very transparent, it actually helped immensely in terms of not spending the first 20 minutes getting people up to speed. But event investor call suddenly was very efficient. They loved the transparency because they'd feel like they're part of the company and the team, and that you're open with them.

-是的，我在博客上写了一篇文章我觉得你应该每月做一次。我的建议，就这些部分而言，应该是最重要的部分，应该是你从你的投资者、投资者和顾问那里要求什么，或者是你发送给谁的人，所以很清楚他们能提供什么帮助。如果他们什么也不读，只要打开电子邮件，他们就会看到。你会得到很多回应的。我认为第二部分可以是度量，如果有度量的话。可能是销售。可能是它是平的，这很好。我认为烧伤很重要，所以你还剩下多少钱？保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)经常主张违约、死亡或活着违约。你会在某个时候用光钱吗？我经常这样说，就像你还剩下多少个月的现金，你还在燃烧多少钱一样。然后你可以在团队周围，市场上，等等进行更新。产品，你推出什么新产品了吗？记者，你拿到什么了吗？我想你能理解。我认为每月一次很重要的原因是你想要创造一个足够高的频率，让你的投资者思考你，让他们觉得他们能跟上速度，但不想让你或他们不知所措。我觉得月刊节奏不错。在Color，我们很早就开始发送投资者的最新信息。我会打电话给一个投资者，我会开始给他们提供关于发生了什么的背景信息。他们会说，“不，我看了你的最新消息。”我知道发生了什么。“我们直接跳过去吧。”通过非常透明，它实际上在不花费前20分钟让人们跟上速度方面有很大的帮助。但事件投资者电话突然变得非常有效。他们喜欢透明度，因为他们会觉得自己是公司和团队的一员，而且你对他们开放。

- Yeah?

-是吗？

- [Man] You're a big proponent of the market first investment strategy. How did you evaluate an unobvious market, like an Airbnb, back in 2010? How did you evaluate that market ?

-[伙计]你是市场第一投资策略的大力支持者。2010年，你是如何评价一个不太明显的市场，比如Airbnb？你是如何评价那个市场的？

- The question is about market opportunity. Since Elad cares most about that, how do you evaluate opportunities that are non-obvious, like Airbnb?

-问题在于市场机会。既然Elad最关心这个问题，你如何评价那些不明显的机会，比如Airbnb？

- I invested in their A versus their seed. I'm guessing the seed was harder. I think at their A, they had pretty clear traction. They were growing at a good clip. Then the other side of it was I had actually traveled on a service called Servos. After World War II, the Esperanto community thought that one way to encourage world peace was to let people stay with each other for free. You'd apply to be a traveler. You do interviews, and then they'd give you these little booklets. If you're traveling to Italy, it'd list everybody in Italy who would be willing to host you, and their phone number and how to contact them. You'd literally call random strangers up or email them, and say, "Hey, can I stay with you? "How long can I stay with you?" You stayed with them for free. I traveled on a very similar service throughout Europe. For me, it was a no-brainer. I thought, wow, you can monetize this. The most expensive asset that a person has is their home. If you can help people monetize their homes and make a lot of money off of it, it actually felt like a no-brainer. But part of that was driven experientially, and then part of it was it was working. More questions? Yeah, back there.

-我投资于他们的A对他们的种子.我猜种子会更硬。我认为在他们的A，他们有相当明显的牵引力。它们生长得很好。另一方面，我实际上是通过一种叫做servos的服务旅行的。二战后，世界语社团认为，鼓励世界和平的一种方法是让人们自由相处。你会申请成为一个旅行者。你做采访，然后他们会给你这些小册子。如果你要去意大利旅行，它会列出意大利所有愿意接待你的人，他们的电话号码，以及如何联系他们。你会直接给陌生人打电话或者给他们发电子邮件，然后说：“嘿，我能和你在一起吗？”“我能和你在一起多久？”你免费和他们住在一起。我在欧洲各地都有类似的服务。对我来说，这是不需要思考的。我想，哇，你可以把这个赚钱了。一个人拥有的最昂贵的资产是他们的家。如果你能帮助人们赚钱并从中赚到很多钱，那你就会觉得自己是个不需要思考的人。但其中的一部分是经验驱动的，然后其中的一部分起作用了。还有问题吗？是的，在后面。

- [Man] Can you talk about doing your due diligence on investors with bad? When things go wrong, didn't go right, because investors are not gonna give you that

-(伙计)你能谈谈如何对那些有问题的投资者做你的尽职调查吗？当事情出了问题，没有正确的时候，因为投资者不会给你这样的机会。

- Yeah, I would basically--

-是的，我基本上-

- The question is about can you talk about due diligence on investors who won't necessarily give you a bad reference?

-问题是，你能不能谈谈投资者的尽职调查，这些投资者不一定会给你一个糟糕的推荐信？

- Yeah. Most of them will have a list of investments either on their website or on AngelList or Crunchbase. If you're part of YC, I think there's Bookface, which has all sorts of information.

-是啊他们中的大多数人都会在他们的网站上，或者在AngelList或者Crunchbase上有一份投资清单。如果你是YC的一员，我想有书面，它有各种各样的信息。

- We have an investor database, yeah.

-我们有一个投资者数据库，是的.

- They have an investor database, so you can actually see what everybody says about them.

-他们有一个投资者数据库，你可以看到每个人对他们的评价。

- Elad has a good grade.

-Elad成绩很好

- Hopefully. I would just look at that list, and then call the two or three things that you'd never heard of, or that shut down, or were small acquisitions, or whatever it may be. Sometimes you'll call a successful company, too, and they'll say, "I'll never work "with this person again." I know one company. You can actually see it. Say that somebody exits their company for a billion dollars. Then they start another company. In no rounds do they take their prior investors. That's usually a sign. I would call up that person.

希望如此我会看一下清单，然后把你从来没听说过的两到三件事叫做“关闭”，“小收购”，或者其他什么。有时你也会打电话给一家成功的公司，他们会说，“我再也不会和这个人一起工作了。”我知道一家公司。你真的可以看到。比如说有人为了10亿美元离开了他们的公司。然后他们又开了一家公司。在任何一轮交易中，他们都不会带走先前的投资者。这通常是个征兆。我会打电话给那个人。

- [Woman] My question is about pricing. As part of product/market fit, I feel like right now we're looking at pricing/market fit. Anything that you can share about pricing journey with your companies or what you advise CEOs?

-[女人]我的问题是关于定价的。作为产品/市场匹配的一部分，我觉得现在我们正在考虑定价/市场匹配。你能和你的公司分享任何关于定价过程的信息，或者你对首席执行官们的建议吗？

- Any advice on pricing?

-对定价有什么建议吗？

- Mark Andreessen has this great quote, which if he had to tell startup founders one thing, I think he says he would tell 'em to raise prices. I think in general, especially technology-driven companies, tend to really under price their product under the belief that if they price it really low, it'll get them more market share more rapidly, and therefore, they'll win the market. When in reality, they've never run the experiment. It's really easy to drop prices.

-马克·安德烈森(MarkAndreessen)有一句名言，如果他不得不告诉初创公司创始人一件事，我想他会告诉他们提高价格。我认为，总的来说，特别是科技驱动的公司，他们的产品价格通常会很低，因为他们相信，如果价格真的很低，他们就能更快地获得更多的市场份额，从而赢得市场。在现实中，他们从来没有做过这个实验。降价真的很容易。

- Really hard to raise them.

-真的很难抚养他们

- It's very hard to raise them. I do think that people also overthink pricing and the changes, and the impact of them, when they have small populations. If ya have a hundred customers that are all small customers, and you raise prices and piss them off, that's okay. You have to do it nicely, or maybe you grandfather them in. There's all sorts of ways you can do it the right way, but I'm just saying it's not an existential moment for the company, unlike if you have 100,000 customers or you have giant enterprises using you, and you're going into these deep negotiations. I think when you have a very small base, you can actually experiment, you can A/B test things, you can do all sorts of things. But in general, I would start on the high end, unless your strategy is explicitly to go for market share and there's a reason for doing that. There's certain markets where that's very important, certain retail, certain areas where you really are generating a data asset. Those may be places where you wanna have low pricing. Often, people will just look at their competitors' websites and say, oh, they're charging 9.99 a month. I should, too. But often, that company hasn't really thought anything through, either, unless they're a older, more sophisticated company. Again, I think I would just sort of start from scratch. There's long things around are you doing value-based pricing or cost-based pricing? There's different ways to price products. I think Michael Deering has a great online tutorial, which I would definitely look up. You could just do a search for Michael Deering pricing. There will be a variety of different segments and approaches. The other thing you could do on the pricing side is good, better, best is a common framework. You have a base product, you have an intermediate product and then you have the high-end product. The high-end product exists largely so that people buy the intermediate product. There's all sorts of pricing tactics that tend to work.

-很难养大它们我确实认为，当人口较少时，人们也会过度考虑定价和变化，以及它们的影响。如果你有100个客户都是小客户，而你提高价格并激怒他们，那没关系。你必须做的很好，或者你把他们的祖父放在里面。有各种各样的方法你可以用正确的方式去做，但我只是想说，对于公司来说，这不是一个生存的时刻，不像你有100，000个客户，或者你有一个巨大的企业在使用你，而你正在进行这些深入的谈判。我认为当你有一个很小的基础，你真的可以实验，你可以A/B测试东西，你可以做各种各样的事情。但总的来说，我会从高端开始，除非你的战略是明确地追求市场份额，并且有理由这么做。在某些特定的市场中，这是非常重要的，某些零售领域，某些领域，你真的在那里生成数据资产。那里可能是你想要低价的地方。通常，人们只会浏览竞争对手的网站就会说，哦，他们每月收费9.99英镑。我也应该。但通常情况下，该公司也没有真正考虑过任何事情，除非他们是一家更老、更老练的公司。我想我还是从零开始吧。你做的是基于价值的定价还是基于成本的定价？有不同的方式为产品定价。我认为MichaelDeering有一个很棒的在线教程，我肯定会查一查。你可以搜索一下迈克尔·德林的定价。将有各种不同的部分和方法。在定价方面你可以做的另一件事是好的，更好的，最好的是一个共同的框架。你有一个基础产品，你有一个中间产品，然后你有一个高端产品。高端产品的大量存在使得人们购买中间产品.有各种各样的定价策略是可行的。

- [Woman] Thank you.

-[女人]谢谢

- Yep?

-是吗？

- [Man] Where you are looking for a consumer company for the company, in the beginning, do you find it difficult to identify? It's a good product, but bad market ? Or maybe the content inside the that maybe is not fitting the customer type? Could you talk about that, identify that problem to see if you have a good product ?

-[人]在哪里你正在为公司寻找一家消费者公司，一开始，你觉得很难辨认吗？这是个好产品，但市场不好？或者里面的内容可能不适合客户类型？你能不能谈谈这个问题，找出那个问题，看看你是否有好的产品？

- I think the question is around, especially in consumer markets, how can you tell what's wrong with the product? It is your strategy, or is it the content, or is it some feature of the product that's missing?

-我认为问题就在这里，特别是在消费市场，你怎么知道产品出了什么问题？这是你的策略，或者是内容，还是缺少产品的某些特性？

- It depends a little bit on what type of consumer product it is. If you have an e-commerce site, it really is about LTV and CAC. Can you acquire customers at a cost less than what you sell the product to them? What's the lifetime value of that customer? There, there's a very small handful of distribution strategies that tend to work, be it SEO or SEM, or other types of either ad formats or customer acquisition strategies. If it's more of a social network, then really it's looking at growth rates and churn, and what are the vectors by which you're pulling people into the product? I think there's a dozen different answers, depending on the market segment. Andrew Chen has some really good blog posts, I think, about some of this stuff, so that may be a good reference to go look up.

-这在一定程度上取决于它是什么类型的消费品。如果你有一个电子商务网站，它真的是关于ltv和cac的。你能以比你卖给他们的产品更低的成本来获得客户吗？那个顾客的终身价值是多少？在那里，有一小部分分销策略，往往是可行的，无论是SEO或SEM，或其他类型的广告格式或客户获取战略。如果说它更像是一个社交网络，那么它实际上是在研究增长率和流动性，以及你将人们带入产品的媒介是什么？我认为有十几个不同的答案，取决于市场细分。陈国强有一些非常好的博客文章，我认为，关于这些东西，所以这可能是一个很好的参考去查阅。

- Okay, one more question. Back there.

好的，还有一个问题后面。

- [Man] In terms of product/market fit, what do you consider a real or a fake wall?

-[人]就产品/市场的适合性而言，你认为真正的或假的墙是什么？

- In terms of product/market fit, what do you consider, how can you tell the difference between an actual wall where you're about to get smashed, or a fake wall that you should smash through?

-就产品/市场的适合性而言，你认为如何区分你将要被砸碎的一堵真正的墙，还是一堵你应该打破的假墙？

- I think every startup that succeeds has fake walls. To some extent, I think it's back to the discussion we hard earlier, which is what is a sign that your product's actually working? It depends on what you mean by a wall, in terms of. For example, if you're growing 20% a month off of a small base, I think that's a sign that it's working, even though people may say, "Oh, you have a small user base. "You're hitting a wall because you're never "gonna get that big." Then you see these companies become giant companies because the use case is much broader. Airbnb is a good example, where I think that market size was bigger than anybody expected. It depends a little bit on what sorta wall you're talking about, but I do think there are clear signs that something is gonna work. Often, they're ignored by the founders themselves because it's just such a leap of faith to think this small, delicate thing that you're working on that's very breakable will actually turn into this amazing giant company. That actually happened to me when I went to Airbnb's Christmas party a few years ago. I invested when it was about eight people. Then I went to the Christmas party. There was like, I don't remember how many, 2,000 people or whatever the number is at that time, dressed in suits. It looked extremely like a very nice corporate holiday event. I was like, oh, my God, this is amazing.

-我认为每一家成功的初创公司都有虚假的墙。在某种程度上，我认为这又回到了我们之前努力讨论的问题，这就是你的产品真正起作用的标志吗？这取决于你所说的墙是什么意思。举个例子，如果你每月从一个小的基础上增长20%，我认为这是一个信号，表明它正在起作用，尽管人们可能会说，“哦，你的用户基数很小。”你撞到了墙，因为你永远不会“变得那么大”。然后你会看到这些公司变成了巨大的公司，因为用例要广泛得多。Airbnb就是一个很好的例子，在那里，我认为市场规模比任何人预期的都要大。这在一定程度上取决于你说的是什么墙，但我确实认为有明显的迹象表明某些东西会奏效。通常，他们被创始人自己忽略了，因为你认为你正在做的这件很容易破碎的小事情实际上会变成一家令人惊叹的大公司，这是一种信念的飞跃。几年前我参加Airbnb的圣诞派对时，我确实遇到了这种情况。我投资的时候大约有八个人。然后我去了圣诞派对。就像，我不记得当时有多少，2000人或者其他的人，穿着西装。它看起来非常像一个非常好的公司假日活动。我就像，哦，天哪，这太棒了。

- What happened?

-发生什么事了？

- No, it was one of those moments where you're like, wow, this really happens. You can go from eight people to thousands over a couple years and build a substantial institution that's gonna survive, potentially, generationally. That's very powerful.

-不，那是你想，哇，这种事真的发生的时刻之一.在过去的几年里，你可以从八个人到几千人，建立一个庞大的机构，它将有可能，世世代代地生存下去。那是非常强大的。
