# A Conversation with Elizabeth Iorns

Elizabeth Iorns: Advice for Biotech Founders

伊丽莎白·艾恩斯：给生物技术创始人的建议

Adora Cheung: Alright guys, we're going to get started. Sorry for being late. So I have up  here, Elizabeth Iorns, is it Dr. Elizabeth Iorns or Professor Elizabeth Iorns? So Elizabeth is  a cancer biologist by training. You got your PhD in Cancer Biology from University of  London, and you did your postdoc, and then became an assistant professor, which you still  are, at University of Miami, School of Medicine. Got this correct?

张朵拉：好了，伙计们，我们要开始了。抱歉来迟了。我在上面，伊丽莎白·奥恩斯，是伊丽莎白·奥恩斯博士还是伊丽莎白·奥恩斯教授？伊丽莎白是一名经过训练的癌症生物学家。你获得了伦敦大学的癌症生物学博士学位，你做了博士后，然后成为了迈阿密大学医学院的助理教授，你现在仍然是。这是对的吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yes.

伊丽莎白：是的。

Adora Cheung: Cool. So in 2011, she started Science Exchange, then called The Bench, which was an  online marketplace for outsourcing science experiments

张朵拉：酷。因此，2011年，她创办了“科学交流”(Science Exchange)，当时名为“长凳”(The Bench)，这是一个外包科学实验的在线市场

And she was part of the Y Combinator Summer  2011 batch, and think you might have been the very first biotech-type company in YC,  right? That's where we started with you

她是2011年夏季Y组合公司的一员，她认为你可能是YC第一家生物技术型公司，对吗？这就是我们从你开始的地方

And she's also the chairman of Reformer Therapeutics,  which just went through YC as well, last batch. She's also a part time partner  at YC, which means in her free time, she helps all our biotech companies which,  this points like hundreds

她也是“改革者治疗学”的主席，该公司刚刚通过了YC，最后一批。她也是YC的兼职合伙人，这意味着在她的空闲时间里，她帮助我们所有的生物技术公司，这些公司就像数百家

I don't know what the exact number is but hundreds of  biotech companies. So today we want to spend time talking about two things in particular,  one is running a marketplace company, since that's what Science Exchange is, and two is  getting your perspective as someone who's now advised hundreds of biotech companies, what you think  about, what's going on the space, I mean particularly because I think there's increase in  slope of scientists coming into the field, so that'd be cool to talk about. So  to get started, like I said you're a cancer biologist by training. You were, I  believe, doing breast cancer research right after college, I guess. How did you even ...  Going down the academic route, how did you come upon startups? Where did that idea  even come from?

我不知道确切的数字是多少，只有几百家生物技术公司。所以今天我们想花些时间讨论两件事-特别是两件事-一是经营一家市场公司，因为这就是科学交流公司，二是了解你的观点，他现在为数百家生物技术公司提供咨询，你在想什么，这是怎么回事，我的意思是，特别是因为我认为进入这个领域的科学家的斜率在增加，所以谈论这个问题是很酷的。所以开始吧，就像我说的，你是一名癌症生物学家。我想你大学毕业后就在做乳腺癌研究。你是怎么.。沿着学术路线走，你是怎么找到创业公司的？这个主意是从哪里来的？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是啊

It was random, especially to start a technology company like Science Exchange rather than  a biotech. So I was actually, I guess taking Y Combinator's advice without knowing about  Y Combinator's advice to solve your own problem. So I was looking at the way  that scientific research was evolving

这是随机的，尤其是像科学交流这样的科技公司，而不是生物技术公司。所以我实际上，我想采纳Y组合者的建议，而不知道Y组合者的建议来解决你自己的问题。所以我在研究科学研究的发展过程

It's becoming much more specialized, much more multi-disciplinary, had to  form these collaborations with other labs in order to access all of the latest technologies.  And I experienced that myself and realized that it was incredibly inefficient

它正变得更加专业化，更多学科，必须与其他实验室形成这些合作，以获取所有的最新技术。我亲身经历了这一切，并意识到这是极其低效的。

And so that  process of how you find somebody to work with, how you evaluate the quality of  their ability to do that specialized work, and then even just the infrastructure to actually  work with them. So in biotech and in scientific research, the actual ownership of the  scientific results is very important

这就是你如何找到工作对象的过程，你如何评估他们完成专门工作的能力的质量，甚至仅仅是与他们一起工作的基础设施。因此，在生物技术和科学研究中，科学成果的实际归属是非常重要的。

And so just figuring out who is actually the owner  of those results? Who has the intellectual property, publication rights? All of those things

找出谁才是这些结果的主人？谁拥有知识产权、出版权？所有这些

It's  very difficult

很难

And so I was talking about this with my co-founder and we looked  at other examples of industries that had solved the similar problem. So we were looking  at oDesk and Elance at the time, which has now become Upwork. But that was  really an example of, you could solve this with a marketplace of experts, and that  was the basis of Science Exchange and it's never really evolved much more beyond that  in terms of the fundamental goal of what the company wants to achieve.

所以我和我的联合创始人讨论了这个问题，我们研究了解决类似问题的其他行业的例子。所以我们当时在研究oDesk和Elance，现在它已经变成了Upwork。但这确实是一个例子，你可以用一个专家市场来解决这个问题，这是科学交流的基础，在公司想要实现的基本目标方面，它从来没有发生过更大的变化。

Adora Cheung: Can you dive a little bit deeper there? So before, if I wanted to do  some research and run an experiment, basically what it sounds like, is this big, disorganized  process of, I need 10 different things, it's super-fragmented where the stuff is. Can you  give it, I guess ... Let me give you an example related to the research  you were doing, of how it's so disorganized and then how Science Exchange now collapses  all that into one place.

张朵拉：你能跳得再深一点吗？所以以前，如果我想做一些研究，做一个实验，基本上它听起来是这样的，这个大的，杂乱无章的过程，我需要10种不同的东西，在这些东西所在的地方，它是非常碎片化的。你能给我吗我想.。让我给大家举一个例子，说明你在做的研究，它是如何如此无序，然后科学交流现在如何崩溃，所有这些在一个地方。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, definitely super disorganized, lots of fragmentation, both in terms of who you work with,  but also how you find the information and in some cases, the information is actually  not really available. So at the time, when I was working as a breast cancer  researcher, I was running multiple different types of experiments

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，绝对是超级混乱，很多零碎，无论是从你和谁一起工作，还是你如何找到信息，在某些情况下，这些信息实际上都是不可得的。所以，在我做乳腺癌研究人员的时候，我做了多种不同类型的实验。

And one example was microarray analysis,  which is differently showing my time away from the lab. Because that's a very old  school technique now, but at the time, it was what we use to analyze gene  expression profiling, and we just didn't have the types of arrays that I wanted to  use

其中一个例子是微阵列分析，这与我离开实验室的时间不同。因为这是一种非常古老的技术，但在当时，这是我们用来分析基因表达谱的方法，而我们只是没有我想要使用的数组类型。

And so I was trying to use Google and asking my friends and asking  my old lab, "Can we use your infrastructure?" And it was just incredibly inefficient. Also  actually the inefficiency drives a lot of inefficiency and pricing in the market. So that  was something that was a big learning point for me. At that time point was  you could actually create a company that had margin and that space because the market  was so inefficient, due to the lack of information. So for example, I was seeing  literally 10 times price differences for an equivalent experiment, because people really just didn't have  access to what should it actually cost

所以我试着用谷歌问我的朋友，问我以前的实验室，“我们能用你的基础设施吗？”而且它是非常低效的。事实上，低效率导致了市场上的许多低效率和定价。对我来说，这是一个很大的学习点。在那个时候，你实际上可以创建一家有利润率和空间的公司，因为由于缺乏信息，市场效率太低了。举个例子，我看到了一个相当的实验的价格差异是实际的10倍，因为人们真的无法获得它的实际成本。

And we see that still on Science Exchange  today, is that when people go and look for multiple options, and they actually don't  have the barriers of being able to work with them, they see very frequently price  differences that are quite extraordinary for the same results that could be generated.

我们今天仍然在科学交流上看到，当人们去寻找多种选择时，他们实际上没有能够与他们合作的障碍，他们经常看到价格差异对于可能产生的同样的结果来说是非常不寻常的。

Adora Cheung: Got it. Just to take one step back, when you were an academic, I don't  know if that's a bad word.

张：明白了。退一步，当你还是个学者的时候，我不知道这是不是个坏词。

Elizabeth Iorns: No.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：不。

Adora Cheung: But when you were an academic-

张朵拉：但是当你还是个学者的时候-

Elizabeth Iorns: Maybe to some people.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：也许对某些人来说。

Adora Cheung: Was that a tough choice, to just make that switch? Because I mean, you spent  so many years studying for this one thing and then you just are starting essentially  what is a tech company, that is not solving that one thing that you spent,  up until that point your entire life going after?

张朵拉：这是一个艰难的选择吗？因为我的意思是，你花了这么多年的时间来研究这件事，然后你刚刚开始了一家高科技公司的本质，这并不是解决你花的一件事，直到你的一生都在追求这一目标？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, and actually at the time I didn't really have a lot of role models  to look to either, so I was in Miami, which was not a very startup  place

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，实际上当时我也没有太多的榜样可供借鉴，所以我在迈阿密，那里并不是一个非常初创的地方。

And now it's actually interesting to see the evolution not just in the biotech  world, but just generally in the startup ecosystem, and all of the infrastructure that's been  created

现在，不仅在生物技术领域，而且通常在启动生态系统中，以及所有已经创建的基础设施中，看到这种进化是很有趣的。

I think University of Miami even has now an incubator associated with the School  of medicine that helps people create companies

我认为迈阿密大学现在甚至有一个孵化器与医学学院联合起来，帮助人们创建公司

I remember at the time having this idea  for a company, and I actually asked the university because I was a little bit  worried if I have this idea, while I'm still working there, will they try to  get some ownership stake from the idea? Because actually, when you work in academia, the  results you generate don't belong to you. So I think there's a common misperception that  universities actually own your work. So it's often a challenge to spin those results out  of the university. So I worried, "Well, if I have this idea, will they own  it?" And so we went and talked to the Tech Transfer office and they were  just, "Whatever, go do whatever you want." And it was interesting, and they didn't really  have any guidance on how to do that. But coincidentally, I read about Y Combinator  in Wired Magazine. So there was actually a Wired magazine interview all those years ago  about Y Combinator

我记得当时我有一个公司的想法，我问了大学，因为我有点担心如果我有这个想法，当我还在那里工作的时候，他们会从这个想法中得到一些股权吗？因为实际上，当你在学术界工作时，你所产生的结果并不属于你。所以我认为有一种普遍的误解认为大学实际上拥有你的工作。因此，将这些结果从大学中剥离出来往往是一项挑战。所以我担心，“好吧，如果我有这个想法，他们会拥有它吗？”于是我们去和技术转让办公室谈了谈，他们只是，“随你便，去做你想做的事。”这很有趣，而且他们没有任何关于如何做到这一点的指导。但巧合的是，我在“连线”杂志上读到了Y组合者的故事。所以很多年前有一次“连线”杂志的采访是关于Y组合的

And that was where I first learned about it, and I was  like, "Wow, that sounds super cool. Why don't we just apply for it?" And we  were total outsiders, we didn't know anybody at Y Combinator. We didn't know anybody that  had gone through Y Combinator. We just applied with this idea and were fortunate enough  to get in.

那是我第一次了解它，我说，“哇，听起来太酷了。我们为什么不直接申请呢？”我们完全是局外人，在YCombinator，我们谁都不认识。我们不知道有谁经历过Y组合。我们刚刚应用了这个想法，很幸运地被录取了。

Adora Cheung: So you talked a little bit about tech transfer

张：所以你谈了一些关于技术转让的问题。

I mean, I do think that  a lot of people in academia who are thinking about starting a start up, do  think that is a huge issue

我是说，我认为学术界很多人都在考虑创业，认为这是个很大的问题。

And in some sense they are, from some universities  we've had to work with, with some of our startups, it is a huge issue.  Do you have any advice for them on how to navigate that process? Should that  be the barrier in your mind?

从某种意义上说，我们不得不与一些大学合作，与我们的一些初创公司合作，这是一个很大的问题。你对他们如何在这个过程中导航有什么建议吗？这应该是你脑海中的障碍吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是啊

I do think it is an issue, particularly for Scientific startups, because if you're  trying to spin out actual research that was done already

我确实认为这是一个问题，特别是对于科学创业公司来说，因为如果你想把已经做过的实际研究

And I think people often  ask me, "What's a good time to join Y Combinator if you're creating a science  startup?" And actually, I do think a good time to join is once you've already  generated a lot of the R&D from grant-funded work, because you don't want to spend  years, and all of this money trying to pursue a research hypothesis, you really want  to be in the development phase

我想人们经常问我，“如果你正在创建一家科学创业公司，什么是加入Y Combinator的好时机？”事实上，我确实认为加入的好时机是，一旦你已经从赠款资助的工作中产生了大量的研发成果，因为你不想花很多年的时间，而所有这些钱都试图追求一个研究假设，你真的想要进入发展阶段。

And so I think that gets very difficult with  a lot of the universities

所以我认为这对很多大学来说都是非常困难的

I think some of them are trying to be more  founder-friendly and create ways to more readily license the results that were generated, but it's  still a significant obstacle.

我认为他们中的一些人正试图变得更易于创始人，并创造出更容易获得授权的方法，但这仍然是一个很大的障碍。

Adora Cheung: Do you see that academics, is a trend they're moving more into startups? Or what  do you see or maybe we just get the bubble view here in San Francisco.  But I mean, that's the only thing I see anecdotally. But do you think that's  a growing trend overall?

张朵拉：你看到学者们，他们更多地进入初创企业的趋势吗？或者你看到了什么，或者我们只是在旧金山看到了泡泡。但我是说，这是我唯一能看到的轶事。但你认为总体上这是一个增长趋势吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, I think people are more willing to just create companies, I think generally

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，我认为人们更愿意仅仅创建公司，我认为一般来说

I  think there's a macro-trend, way beyond sciences, really just entrepreneurship has become this viable career  path

我认为有一个宏观趋势，远远超越科学，真正的创业已经成为这条可行的职业道路。

And people are, "Oh yeah, I could create a company, and it's just become  a lot easier." The infrastructure that's being created through Y Combinator, but also through things  like stripe, and things like AWS has made it so much easier for people to  create companies, and I think in the science space we're starting to see that, so  obviously Science Exchange is one way to do that, but there's some really interesting other  evolutions like LabCentral, and other lab space [inaudible] that provide lab space by The Bench  that's very cost effective, and you can just rent one bench per month and be  able to get started really cost effectively. So those things are lowering the barriers to  entry

人们会说，“哦，是的，我可以创建一家公司，这样就变得容易多了。”通过Y Combinator创建的基础设施，也可以通过stripe和AWS这样的东西来创建公司，我认为在科学领域，我们已经开始看到这一点，很明显，科学交流是一种方法，但也有一些非常有趣的其他进化，比如LabCentral，和其他实验室空间(听不见的)，提供实验室空间的长凳，这是非常符合成本效益的，你可以只租用一张板凳每月，并能够得到真正有效的启动。所以这些东西降低了进入的门槛

And so I think academics, what I would like to see more of is  how can we allow, the true, I would say the analogy to what we've seen  in the engineering world, the software engineering world is that the actual developers, the software  developers, become the entrepreneurs and they maintain that and really build this company around them.  I think that's still very difficult for scientists, particularly PhD and postdoc scientists. So they  actually make the discoveries in these labs, so they're the ones doing the work, but  a lot of time for them to actually be the ones to be the founder  of the company is pretty challenging

所以我想学者们，我想看到更多的是，我们如何允许，真的，我会说，我们在工程界看到的类比，软件工程世界是，实际的开发人员，软件开发人员，成为企业家，他们维护这一点，并真正围绕他们建立这个公司。我认为这对科学家来说仍然是非常困难的，尤其是博士和博士后科学家。所以他们实际上是在这些实验室里发现的，所以他们才是做这项工作的人，但是对于他们来说，成为公司创始人的很多时间是很有挑战性的。

And usually what you'll see is a well established  famous PI, so a principal investigator, being a co-founder of that company, just to give  it legitimacy and then that usually allows people to bring in funding. But, I think  that's also sad, why do we have to have these figureheads who own large stakes  of these companies, in order for them to get off the ground and get started?  And I want to see that change.

通常你会看到的是一个著名的PI，所以作为该公司的联合创始人的首席调查员，只是为了给它合法性，然后通常允许人们带来资金。但是，我认为这也是可悲的，为什么我们必须有这些拥有这些公司的大量股份的有名无实的领导人，才能让他们起步并开始呢？我想看到这种变化。

Adora Cheung: Yeah, that's something we as you know, talk a lot about to people, when they  apply, and then we see that structure, and then you try to go help them  fix it, essentially.

张：是的，我们知道，当人们申请的时候，我们会跟他们谈论很多事情，然后我们看到这个结构，然后你试着帮他们修复它，本质上。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的。

Adora Cheung: Don't want to lose too much of your company too soon. All right, so Science  Exchange. So you already described what problem you're trying to solve

张朵拉：不要太早就失去太多的公司。好吧，那么科学交流。所以你已经描述了你想要解决的问题

And then you've decided  at this point in 2011, start the startup, how did you get your first users?  And you have two sides the marketplace, so it's doubly hard for you. How did  you approach both sides?

然后你决定在2011年的这个时候开始创业，你是如何得到你的第一批用户的？你在市场上有两面，所以这对你来说是双重的困难。你是如何接近双方的？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, I think marketplaces are really challenging because you don't control really the success of  the business

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，我认为市场真的很有挑战性，因为你不能真正控制企业的成功

I mean, you do, but you don't have ... You're not just building  something and selling it. You have to then make sure you have the things to  sell on the other side. So it is really challenging

我是说，你知道，但你没有.你不只是在造一些东西然后卖掉它。然后，你必须确保你有在另一边出售的东西。所以这真的很有挑战性

I think when we first  started, we were very MVP like in our approach. So I think the first version  of Science Exchange, which as you mentioned was actually called the bench which was renamed  during Y Combinator, thanks to Paul Graham's very good advice about our poor naming choice.  So yeah, we threw up this website and it was literally like, "Put what you  need on this website and then other people will see it and that will give  you options." Which is even at the time as a scientist, I was like, "I  want to use this." It seemed like very quick to get something up and see  who would test it out, but it was obvious right from the start that we'd  actually have to create a true marketplace and have supply that was visible, and actually  even more so with Sciences Exchange. What we had to do was create a curated  marketplace that operates in the B2B sector. So what we had to do is build  QAs or quality assurance, we had to actually qualify and contract every provider that's available  through the Marketplace, and then surface all of the results, so that when somebody comes  to the marketplace, they can literally find what they need, and they can give them  the information that's required for them to be able to quote accurately because they already  know there's confidentiality agreements in place

我想当我们第一次开始的时候，我们是非常MVP的，就像我们的方法一样。所以我认为第一个版本的科学交流，正如你所提到的，实际上被称为长凳，它在Y组合器期间被重新命名，这要感谢Paul Graham关于我们糟糕的命名选择的非常好的建议。所以是的，我们抛出了这个网站，就像，“把你需要的东西放到这个网站上，然后其他人会看到它，这会给你提供选择。”甚至在当时我还是个科学家，我说，“我想用这个。”似乎很快就能找到一些东西，看看谁来测试它，但很明显，从一开始，我们就必须创建一个真正的市场，并拥有可见的供应，而科学交易所的情况更是如此。我们要做的是创建一个在B2B部门运作的策划市场。所以我们要做的是建立QAS或质量保证，我们必须对每一个通过市场提供的供应商进行资格认证和合同，然后公开所有的结果，这样当有人来到市场时，他们就可以真正地找到他们需要的东西，他们可以给他们所需要的信息，让他们能够准确地引用，因为他们已经知道有保密协议

And then they actually also had to manage those  projects. Because these aren't just put it in your cart and checkout, you have to  actually manage a project with somebody who works in another part of the world from  you

然后他们还必须管理这些项目。因为这些不仅仅是放在你的购物车和结账上，你必须和你在世界另一个地方工作的人一起管理一个项目。

And so all this had to be built into the software. So that was  many iterations of learning about where really is the value that comes from what we  are providing

因此，所有这些都必须内置到软件中。因此，这是许多关于我们所提供的东西的真正价值来源的反复学习。

And I think marketplaces have evolved a lot from being predominantly consumer-focus, there's  a lot of interesting B2B examples that are emerging, and Science Exchange obviously, sits very  firmly in that category.

我认为市场已经从以消费者为中心发展了很多，有很多有趣的B2B例子正在出现，而且科学交流显然也是如此。

Adora Cheung: What was more difficult, supply or demand?

张朵拉：什么是比较困难的，供给还是需求？

Elizabeth Iorns: Definitely demand. So supply for us, is and was pretty straightforward in the sense that  providers are looking for work, providers of these services, it's a very fast growing industry.  So also highly fragmented, and they actually also suffer the same challenges that the demand  side has. So for them, if they want to sell one of their projects, they  actually have to go on contract with each client they work with, which can take  several months and they have to go through quality assurance and get set up

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：绝对需要。因此，对我们来说，供应是非常简单的，因为供应商正在寻找工作，这些服务的提供者，这是一个快速增长的行业。因此，它们也非常分散，实际上也面临着与需求方相同的挑战。因此，对于他们来说，如果他们想出售他们的一个项目，他们实际上必须与每一个与他们一起工作的客户签订合同，这可能需要几个月的时间，他们必须通过质量保证并建立起来。

And  so for them, if they are on Science Exchange, now, all of a sudden, every  one of our clients can work with them instantly. So that's a huge value proposition.  It took us a lot longer to convince the large players in the market, so  the large CROs, that this would be something that they should be part of. But  actually, we have been able to do that as well. So I think one of  the important lessons that we learned quickly was, for this to be a really effective  solution, it had to be the platform that was used for everything at the companies  that were using it. So not just one off come and shop on the marketplace,  but actually use it as a system for managing all of the projects that are  going on with the external partners

所以对他们来说，如果他们在进行科学交流，现在，突然之间，我们的每一个客户都可以立即与他们合作。这是一个巨大的价值主张。我们花了很长的时间来说服市场上的大公司，所以大型的CRO，相信这将是他们应该参与的事情。但事实上，我们也能做到这一点。所以我认为我们很快学到的一个重要的教训是，要想使这是一个真正有效的解决方案，它必须是一个平台，它被用于所有使用它的公司。因此，不只是一次来市场购物，而是实际使用它作为一个系统来管理与外部合作伙伴正在进行的所有项目。

And in order to do that, you truly do  have to have all of the major players that they want to work with on  the platform

为了做到这一点，你必须拥有他们想要在平台上与之合作的所有主要参与者。

And I've seen other companies who have B2B marketplaces struggle a little bit  where they haven't had the large established players on the supply side

我也见过有B2B市场的其他公司有些挣扎，因为他们在供应方面还没有强大的老牌企业。

And without that,  I think it's very difficult to have an enterprise partnership that uses the platform.

没有这一点，我认为很难有一个使用该平台的企业伙伴关系。

Adora Cheung: Do you remember on the demand side, the very first customer? What were they? What  did they do?

张朵拉：你还记得在需求方面，第一位顾客吗？他们是什么？他们做了什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, totally

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，完全是

I remember actually. So our first customers were totally my friends who were  scientists, who I would tell, "If you have experiments you're running, you have to try  out Science Exchange." And actually it was great user feedback because for them, it did  turn out to be this really high touch, very concierge service. So they found great  options that were really cost effective. So it wasn't they just used it because we  made them. But I think they they taught us enormous amount. But I also remember  the first customer that ever was just not related to us, just came onto the  platform and used it

其实我记得。所以我们的第一批顾客完全是我的朋友，他们是科学家，我会告诉他们，“如果你正在做实验，你必须尝试科学交流。”事实上，这是很好的用户反馈，因为对他们来说，这确实是一种非常高接触，非常礼宾的服务。因此，他们找到了非常好的选择，它们确实具有成本效益。所以不是他们用它是因为我们做的。但我想他们教会了我们很多。但我也记得第一位与我们没有关系的顾客，只是来到了平台上并使用了它。

And that was pretty exciting. We were actually in Italy in  my brother's wedding

那真是太令人兴奋了。我们在意大利参加了我哥哥的婚礼

And I was like, "Oh, my God, somebody used our website, yay."

我说，“哦，天哪，有人用了我们的网站，耶。”

Adora Cheung: Stop the wedding

张朵拉：停止婚礼

I need to check this out.

我得看看这个。

Elizabeth Iorns: Totally.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：完全是。

Adora Cheung: What was the experiment they were trying to run? Do you remember?

张朵拉：他们试图运行的实验是什么？你还记得吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: It was microarray as well. This was popular at that time.

伊丽莎白·艾恩斯：这也是微阵列。这在当时很流行。

Adora Cheung: So we talked a lot about at Startup School, product market fit. For you what  was that like? When did you know you had that? And how did you define  it? And what metrics were you looking at?

张朵拉：所以我们在创业学校谈了很多关于产品市场适合的话题。对你来说那是什么感觉？你什么时候知道你有这种病的？你是怎么定义的？你在看什么指标？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, for us, I think we defined product market fit when we had our first  large pharmaceutical client actually use the platform for whole sectors of their business. So for  us, it was Amgen and they used they launched Science Exchange for all of their  discovery research, which was a really big deal for us at the time

伊丽莎白·艾恩斯：是的，对我们来说，当我们的第一个大型制药客户真正将这个平台用于他们整个行业的时候，我想我们已经定义了产品市场的适合性。所以对我们来说，这是安进，他们用他们发起的科学交流来进行他们所有的发现研究，这在当时对我们来说是一件很重要的事情。

And we  realized, "Oh, we actually have something that ... They do a lot of steps manually  at the moment, and this product actually automates providing all the information about who they  should work with, all of these new options for new types of technologies that they  might be just exploring and then even actually their business and business intelligence around, looking  at spend and supplier performance." So those things took us a while to figure out  where the core value props were.

我们意识到，“哦，我们确实有一些.他们现在手工执行了很多步骤，这个产品实际上自动提供了他们应该和谁一起工作的所有信息，所有这些新的技术选项，他们可能只是在探索，甚至是他们的商业和商业智能，看看他们的消费和供应商的表现。“所以这些东西花了我们一段时间才弄清楚核心价值道具在哪里。

Adora Cheung: You know you're onto something when a big company who spent many years and money  trying to build that problem, and solve that problem internally has all of a sudden  just shifted to your product

张：你知道，当一家大公司花了很多年和金钱来解决这个问题，并在内部解决这个问题的时候，你突然转向了你的产品。

And it's starting to pay you for that. That's a  big thing.

它开始付钱给你了。这是件大事。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的。

Adora Cheung: And not just in biotech, but in general for-

张朵拉：不仅在生物技术领域，而且在一般情况下-

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是啊

I mean, much moreso I think in software

我是说，我觉得在软件领域

It's really interesting, because people always  ask me today, "Who are your main competitors? How do you think about competitive differentiation?"  And all that, and still to me, our main competitor is status quo, so that  people still set up these really crazy SharePoint processes to manage their external vendors

这真的很有趣，因为今天人们总是问我，“你的主要竞争对手是谁？你是如何看待竞争差异化的？”所有这些，对我来说，我们的主要竞争对手是现状，所以人们仍然建立这些真正疯狂的SharePoint进程来管理他们的外部供应商。

And  I always go in there, I'm like, "This is horrible, why are you doing this?"  And big companies, they just love SharePoint, they're like, "Oh, yeah, my SharePoint site, I  have created all of these really Byzantine processes, which only apply to five vendors I  work with

我总是进去，我说，“这太可怕了，你为什么要这么做？”大公司，他们只是喜欢SharePoint，他们说，“哦，是的，我的SharePoint站点，我创建了所有这些非常拜占庭式的过程，它们只适用于我工作的五个供应商

And everyone else has to go through some other crazy process, and I'm  like, "Okay, but you can just transition all of that onto this platform." And it's  always this interesting battle of who set up that process? Because trying to convince him  that the software automates all that hard work is often actually one of our biggest  challenges.

每个人都要经历一些其他疯狂的过程，我想，“好吧，但是你可以把所有这些都转移到这个平台上。”总是有一场有趣的战斗，是谁建立了这个过程？因为试图让他相信软件可以自动完成所有的艰苦工作，这实际上是我们面临的最大挑战之一。

Adora Cheung: So one of the things I really love that you're doing, and announced a long  time ago, was the Reproducibility Initiative. So the idea that it seems obvious to do,  which is, if you run an experiment and you publish results, someone else should be  able to reproduce it, to validate that it's being done. So can you talk a  little bit about why you're doing that? What you're doing, and why has this never  been done? Has it just been a money problem or is it something that only  Science Exchange actually can do, because you have the process in place?

张：所以我很喜欢你做的事情之一，并且在很久以前就宣布了，那就是可复制性倡议。这个想法似乎很明显，如果你做了一个实验，发布了结果，其他人应该能够复制它，来验证它是否已经完成。你能说说你为什么要这么做吗？你在做什么，为什么从来没做过？这是一个资金问题，还是只有科学交流才能做到，因为你已经准备好了？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, the Reproducibility Initiative, I still think it's a really cool project

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，再现性计划，我仍然认为这是一个很酷的项目

It's still very  controversial even years later.

即使在几年后，这仍然是很有争议的。

Adora Cheung: Really?

张朵拉：真的吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: Oh, yeah.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：哦，是的。

Adora Cheung: Why is it controversial?

张朵拉：为什么有争议？

Elizabeth Iorns: Oh, my God, still so controversial

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：哦，天哪，还是这么有争议

It's controversial because of a lot of reasons

这是有争议的，因为有很多原因

I  think the main reason is that people are not sure of the value of it,  which I think is legitimate

我认为主要原因是人们不确定它的价值，我认为这是合法的。

I think there's still a question of, how efficient is  it to replicate experiments? And that's, that was actually ... When you say, "Is it  Science Exchange, was the only way we could do it?" Our hypothesis was that, "Yeah,  having a network, where people already had all of the right essays, or the right  infrastructure, or the right animal model, would be the only way that was actually practically  possible to do it." Previously, obviously, people didn't have that, they had that same challenge  of, "Oh, I have to go find somebody who has that same animal model or  has that same instrument, and then I have to convince them and contact them." And  all that stuff. So yeah, the Reproducibility Initiative actually is Science Exchange's, part of our  mission to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research

我认为还有一个问题，复制实验的效率有多高？那实际上是.。当你说，“这是科学交流，是我们唯一能做到的方法吗？”我们的假设是，“是的，拥有一个网络，人们已经拥有了所有正确的文章，或者正确的基础设施，或者正确的动物模型，这将是唯一可行的方法。”以前，很明显，人们没有这个，他们有同样的挑战，“哦，我得去找一个有同样动物模型或者有相同仪器的人，然后我得说服他们，和他们联系。”还有那些东西。所以是的，可复制性倡议实际上是科学交流的一部分，这是我们提高科学研究质量和效率的使命之一。

And that that project is  quite broad. So it covers both things like antibody validation, which we've done a lot  of. Reagent validation, things like re-analysis of epidemiology results. So we worked with the Gates  Foundation to do that

这个项目相当广泛。所以它涵盖了抗体验证这两个方面，我们已经做了很多。试剂验证，如重新分析流行病学结果。所以我们和盖茨基金会合作

And then the projects that we're most well known for, which  is actually replicating published results

然后是我们最著名的项目，它实际上是在复制已发表的结果

And we do that both for the pharmaceutical industry, which  is way easier and way less controversial, because they just come and say, "Hey, I'm  interested in this result." And then we quickly find a facility that can replicate the  key results and provide these back to them. However, the Cancer Biology Reproducibility Project and  the Prostate Cancer Foundation project, are the two ones that people have followed the most,  which is public replications, where we've actually published the replication studies

我们这样做是为了制药业，这很容易，也不那么有争议，因为他们只是过来说，“嘿，我对这个结果很感兴趣。”然后我们很快找到一个可以复制关键结果并将这些结果反馈给他们的设施。然而，癌症生物学可复制性项目和前列腺癌基金会项目是人们最关注的两个项目，也就是公开复制，我们实际上已经在那里发表了复制研究报告。

And that's controversial because  people don't generally do this. So I think it goes against the cultural norm of  really not publishing replication studies

这是有争议的，因为人们通常不会这么做。所以我认为这违反了不发表复制研究的文化规范。

I also think people are really afraid, and they mix  up failed replication with things like fraud. So people are really afraid that if the  result is found to be non-reproducible, that that will have a negative impact on their  career, which I think is probably true, but it shouldn't be. So the reality is  that the results that have been generated show that most published results are not reproducible.  So if that's true, then we should try to understand that and study it, which  is my opinion as a scientist, we should study the science behind, why is this  the case? Rather than try to go after individual people and say, "Oh, your science  is horrible." Because clearly, that's not the case. Clearly, it's that most things are not  reproducible when they publish, because of a variety of complex factors, of which we've started  to impact. But I think there's still a lot of work to do.

我也认为人们真的很害怕，他们把失败的复制和欺诈之类的东西混为一谈。所以人们真的害怕如果结果被发现是不可复制的，那将对他们的事业产生负面影响，我认为这可能是真的，但不应该是这样。因此，现实情况是，已经产生的结果表明，大多数已发表的结果是不可复制的。所以如果这是真的，那么我们应该试着去理解和研究它，这是我作为一个科学家的观点，我们应该研究背后的科学，为什么会这样呢？而不是去追求个别的人，说，“哦，你的科学是可怕的。”因为很明显，事实并非如此。很明显，大多数事情在出版时都是不可复制的，因为有各种各样的复杂因素，我们已经开始影响这些因素了。但我认为还有很多工作要做。

Adora Cheung: What are the two top two complex factors?

张朵拉：两个最复杂的因素是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: So I think the main reason that I've seen things are not reproducible is the  quality of essay validation. So it's really interesting when you go and talk to pharmaceutical  companies, because they also transfer experiments. So they replicate experiments in the sense that they'll  see something up at their facility, and then they'll outsource to a CRO to run  their essay for them, over and over again

伊丽莎白·艾恩斯：所以我认为我看到的东西不能被复制的主要原因是论文的质量。所以，当你去和制药公司交谈的时候，这真的很有趣，因为他们也会进行实验。因此，他们复制实验的意义是，他们会在自己的设备上看到一些东西，然后将其外包给CRO，为他们一遍又一遍地运行他们的文章。

And they call it tech transfer or  essay transfer

他们称之为技术转让或论文转让

And that process is incredibly efficient, they can do this very easily, and  it's got a high probability of working

这个过程是非常有效的，他们可以很容易地做到这一点，而且它有很高的工作概率

And so when you look at that, I  don't think it's much different than if you take a published result, and you try  and rerun that essay in another lab. But the main difference is that when you  work in a pharmaceutical company you have SOPs, you have everything documented, you look at  essay variability, you look at positive and negative controls. There's just a lot more actual  validation of the type, the actual experimental essay that's used before it's transferred

所以当你看这个的时候，我认为这和你发表的结果并没有太大的不同，你试着在另一个实验室重新运行这篇文章。但主要的区别是，当你在一家制药公司工作时，你有SOP，所有的东西都有记录，你看文章的可变性，你看到的是积极的和消极的对照。只是有更多的实际验证的类型，实际的实验论文，使用之前，它被转移

And that's  very different than in academia. So in academia, you tend to take, "Oh, yeah, I've  got this animal model in my lab." Or, "I've got this cell line in my  lab, I'm just going to run this experiment." And hopefully, you include your positive and  negative control, but maybe not

这和学术界完全不同。所以在学术界，你往往会说，“哦，是的，我的实验室里有这个动物模型。”或者，“我在我的实验室里找到了这个细胞，我要做这个实验。”希望你包括你的积极和消极控制，但也许不是

And you also don't look at things like variability of  the essay, reproducibility of the essay

你也不看文章的可变性，文章的可重复性

And I think a lot of what we see  in published results is likely to be noise, rather than true experimental effects

我认为，我们在发表的结果中看到的很多东西很可能是噪音，而不是真正的实验效果。

And so  until we understand that more, we will have an issue with reproducing those results.

因此，在我们理解更多之前，我们在复制这些结果时会遇到问题。

Adora Cheung: That's sort of scary. But you're saving the world. So save us from this problem.  So going back to Science Exchange, what is the biggest challenge as a CEO of  a marketplace company that you have today? And how has that challenge morphed over time?  What was the biggest challenge when you just started to what is the biggest challenge  today?

张朵拉：这有点吓人。但你在拯救世界。所以把我们从这个问题中拯救出来。那么回到科学交流，作为一家市场公司的首席执行官，你今天面临的最大挑战是什么？随着时间的推移，这种挑战是如何演变的呢？当你刚开始的时候，最大的挑战是什么？今天最大的挑战是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Oh, yeah, I'm sure. So many challenges along the way. When we first starter Science  Exchange, the biggest challenge was, "Can we get anybody to use it?" I think that  was the first challenge

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：哦，是的，我确定。一路上有很多挑战。当我们第一次启动科学交流时，最大的挑战是，“我们能让任何人使用它吗？”我认为这是第一个挑战

And then, "Can we build something where the very conservative pharmaceutical  industry will use it?" And that was important for us, because when you look at  spinned breakdown, the market is predominantly for outsourced research, focused in the pharmaceutical industry, so  that they control over 100 billion dollars of spinned per year

然后，“我们能建造一些非常保守的制药业会使用它的东西吗？”这对我们来说很重要，因为当你看旋转分解的时候，市场主要是外包的研究，集中在制药业，所以他们每年控制超过1000亿美元的纺丝。

And so if we  get them to use the platform, we would have a lot of issue with really  creating a truly large company. Today, I think our biggest issues are more around scaling.  So we're still only 85 people, we've designed a couple of extremely large partnerships

因此，如果我们让他们使用这个平台，我们就会对真正创建一家真正的大公司产生很大的争议。今天，我认为我们最大的问题是扩大规模。所以我们仍然只有85个人，我们设计了几个非常大的合作伙伴

And  so we're really trying to execute against some pretty tight deadlines with staff that are  focused on just one of these large integrations

因此，我们正试图在一些非常紧迫的最后期限前执行，而这些工作人员只专注于这些大型集成中的一个。

And so trying to make sure that  we don't take on too much while also realizing there's enormous opportunity. So we don't  want to overlook that. So I think just staying focused, executing on the right things  and being really disciplined about that, which is always really hard when you have multiple  opportunities that you can go after

因此，努力确保我们不会承担太多，同时也意识到有巨大的机会。所以我们不想忽视这一点。所以我认为，只要集中精力，执行正确的事情，并在这方面受到严格的约束，当你有多个机会可以追求的时候，这总是很困难的。

I think that discipline is incredibly important.

我认为纪律是非常重要的。

Adora Cheung: Yeah, focus is really hard, especially as you get more employees, and you get more  funding and stuff like that. So I want to switch gears a little bit and  talk about biotech and startups. As we talked about earlier, there has been this implosion  of biotech startups recently, especially in Silicon Valley, what do you think that is? What  are the causes for this?

张朵拉：是的，专注真的很难，特别是当你有更多的员工，你得到更多的资金和诸如此类的东西。所以我想换个话题谈谈生物技术和初创公司。正如我们之前所说的，生物技术初创企业最近发生了一次内爆，尤其是在硅谷，你认为这是什么？造成这种情况的原因是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, the biotech industry is so interesting right now

伊丽莎白：是的，生物技术产业现在很有趣。

And it's actually amazing, I love  ..

真的很棒，我爱.。

And it's not just here in Silicon Valley, it's everywhere. So the UK, Cambridge,  San Diego, everywhere, there's lots and lots of biotech startups

它不仅在硅谷，而且无处不在。所以英国，剑桥，圣地亚哥，到处都有很多生物技术创业公司

And I think it's a  really cool time for that sector of the industry

我认为这对这个行业来说是个很酷的时刻

It's I think driven by a  couple of things, one capital, so access to capital never is unprecedented

我认为这是由几个因素驱动的，一个资本，所以获得资本从来都不是前所未有的。

And the amount  of capital that's going into biotech is definitely unprecedented. There's also an interesting evolution and  in terms of where biology is, in terms of the actual therapeutic modalities that are  available. So I'm not sure that people who are outside the industry may not recognize  this as a real turning point for biotech. So up until very recently, there was  really only small molecule inhibitors, and then after that, there was Genentech and Amgen, so  there was actual biologics. So antibodies and proteins. But just in the last year, we  had gene therapies approved, we had cell-based therapies approved, we had RNAi approved, it's actual  marketable products for the first time. So all of a sudden, you have this huge  window opened up for you and the different types of approaches you can take that  are viable to create a commercial product. So I think that science has caught up  to a point where there's just some phenomenal opportunities to tackle diseases in a way  that was not possible previously.

而投入生物技术的资本绝对是前所未有的。也有一个有趣的进化，在生物学的位置，在实际的治疗方式方面，是可用的。因此，我不确定那些在这个行业之外的人是否会意识到这是生物技术的一个真正的转折点。所以直到最近，只有小分子的抑制剂，然后，有基因和安进，所以有真正的生物制剂。所以抗体和蛋白质。但就在去年，我们批准了基因疗法，我们批准了基于细胞的疗法，我们获得了RNAi的批准，这是第一次真正可销售的产品。因此，突然之间，你打开了一个巨大的窗口，你可以采取的各种不同的方法，是可行的，创造一个商业产品。所以我认为科学已经发展到了这样一个阶段，那就是有一些惊人的机会可以用以前不可能的方式来对付疾病。

Adora Cheung: Interesting, sort of Moore's law in biotech.

张：有趣，有点像生物技术中的摩尔定律。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yes, really

伊丽莎白：是的，真的

It's a really exciting time

这是一个令人兴奋的时刻

And there's also I think, a convergence on  ... Really a critical mass of people looking at, "Okay, I have this experience in  the pharmaceutical industry, I'm going to go into the biotech industry." So again, just so  many people with really great scientific experience, with true experience of bringing, not from academia,  actually an industry bringing drugs to market and now going into biotech, and they're taking  that risk and founding companies and being early employees and these five-person companies

我也认为，有一种趋同.很多人都在看，“好吧，我在制药业有这样的经验，我要进入生物技术行业。”所以再一次，只有这么多的人有着很好的科学经验，真正的经验是带来，而不是来自学术界，实际上是一个将药品推向市场并进入生物技术领域的行业，他们冒着这个风险，创立了公司，成为了早期员工和这些五人公司。

And I  never had seen that previously

我以前从没见过

I think that's a new phenomenon as well.

我认为这也是一种新现象。

Adora Cheung: So you sit in this cool intersection of, you've built a software company, a marketplace  software company and that intersects with biotech

张：所以你坐在这个酷的十字路口，你已经建立了一家软件公司，一家市场软件公司，它与生物技术交叉。

And then you have the perspective of advising  lots of more true I guess, biotech companies. What's the difference between biotech and software?

然后你就有机会为很多更真实的生物技术公司提供建议。生物技术和软件有什么区别？

Elizabeth Iorns: So different.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：太不一样了。

Adora Cheung: In terms of running the startup itself?

张朵拉：在运营创业本身方面？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yes, really different

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，真的不一样

I think in some ways-

我觉得在某些方面-

Adora Cheung: Or let me rephrase the question.

张朵拉：或者让我重新表述一下这个问题。

Elizabeth Iorns: Okay.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：好的。

Adora Cheung: How is it the same? Are there any similarities?

张朵拉：怎么一样？有什么相似之处吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: I think it's the same in terms of people, focus, funding, all of those things  are the same. So trying to find the right people and retain them, building a  good culture, all of this thing, actually, I think YC is really being able to  do a great job of having companies across different sectors, because of their focus on  really learning from successful entrepreneurs. So big lessons about creating a company, and not so  much about the very minute tactical details. Biotechs are different because you can't really change  the outcome of the science, the science is the science, so either it works, or  it doesn't work

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：我认为在人、焦点、资金等方面都是一样的，所有这些都是一样的。所以试图找到合适的人并留住他们，建立一种良好的文化，事实上，我认为YC在让不同行业的公司都做得很好，因为他们专注于真正地向成功的企业家学习。关于创建一家公司的重大教训，而不是非常微小的战术细节。生物技术是不同的，因为你不能真正改变科学的结果，科学就是科学，所以它要么起作用，要么不起作用。

And that's very different than software where you can actually pivot around,  and keep developing your product and keep getting product market fit. With science it's about  key milestones that demonstrate real inflection points in terms of mitigating the risk of the  drug working. So actually having different stages along the development path, where you've eventually got  to a point where you demonstrate in a clinical trial that your drug is effective  at treating disease that you're trying to treat.

这和软件是完全不同的，在软件中，你可以转向，不断地开发你的产品，并不断地适应产品市场。与科学有关的关键里程碑，显示了真正的拐点，在降低风险的药物作用。因此，实际上在发展道路上有不同的阶段，最终你会在临床试验中证明你的药物在治疗你想要治疗的疾病方面是有效的。

Adora Cheung: What does an MVP mean in biotech?

张：MVP在生物技术中意味着什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, I think MVP in biotech is ..

伊丽莎白：是的，我认为生物技术的MVP是.。

I don't know if there is an  MVP. So for a biotech company that's in the therapeutic space, really, you're not going  to have any commercial revenue until you have an approved product that is sold on  the market, which actually most biotechs never have. So most biotechs go through process of  developing new therapies, and they do partnerships with large companies that fund the expensive clinical  development of those products

我不知道有没有MVP。所以对于一家在治疗领域的生物技术公司来说，你将不会有任何商业收入，除非你有一种获得批准的产品在市场上销售，而这实际上是大多数生物技术公司从来没有的。因此，大多数生物技术人员都经历了开发新疗法的过程，并与大公司建立了合作伙伴关系，为这些产品的昂贵临床开发提供资金。

And so that's really where a lot of them end up  exiting. So they either acquire it or they sell or partner their product in early  clinical development. We're starting to see, which I think is really cool, some biotech companies  actually commercialize their own products now, and that was something that didn't happen for quite  a long time. So just recently, there's several companies that are actually selling their product  themselves. So building their own sales force, and distribution channels

所以这就是他们中很多人最终退出的地方。所以他们要么获得它，要么在早期临床开发中销售或合作他们的产品。我们开始看到，我认为这真的很酷，一些生物技术公司实际上已经将他们自己的产品商业化了，这是很长一段时间没有发生的事情。因此，就在最近，有几家公司实际上也在自行销售他们的产品。所以建立自己的销售队伍和分销渠道

And those challenges are really  interesting. Mostly those companies are going after rare diseases where you can go after key  opinion leaders and have a really efficient sales channel. But it's still really exciting to  see them do that.

这些挑战真的很有趣。大多数情况下，这些公司都在追求罕见的疾病，在那里，你可以找到关键的意见领袖，并拥有一个真正有效的销售渠道。但看到他们这么做还是很令人兴奋的。

Adora Cheung: That's great. Well, let me actually double click on that point you made. So essentially  what you're saying is that I can bring my product to market without getting acquired,  which used to be the case. At that specific juncture, what has changed that has  allowed that to happen?

张朵拉：那太好了。好吧，让我双击你说的那个点。所以从本质上讲，你的意思是，我可以在不被收购的情况下将我的产品推向市场，这是过去的情况。在这一特定时刻，是什么改变了这种情况？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, that's a good question

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，这是个好问题

I think capital. So access to capital, really important. That  the companies can actually access enough capital to get all the way through to approval.  I also think the FDA has done some really interesting work trying to come up  with reasonable clinical development strategies for particularly rare diseases, where companies can actually get registration  with a fairly small trial. So that makes it actually feasible for a small company  to be able to do that

我想是资本。所以获得资金是非常重要的。这些公司实际上可以获得足够的资金来获得批准。我还认为FDA做了一些非常有趣的工作，试图为特别罕见的疾病制定合理的临床开发策略，在那里，公司实际上可以通过一项相当小的试验获得注册。因此，对于一家小公司来说，能够做到这一点实际上是可行的。

And then in terms of distribution, I do think  that strategy of just building really strong patient advocacy networks, working with the key opinion  leaders in the community, through the hospitals that these patients are treated at, provides a  way to distribute that

然后在分配方面，我确实认为，通过治疗这些病人的医院，与社区中的主要舆论领袖合作，建立真正强大的病人宣传网络的策略，提供了一种传播这一信息的方法。

In the past, I think if it's a blockbuster indication, it  becomes very challenging, you have to build a huge sales force, you have to go  and sell this drug with old school pharmaceutical sales reps, it's not easy to do  that.

在过去，我认为如果这是一个巨大的迹象，它变得非常具有挑战性，你必须建立一个庞大的销售队伍，你必须去和老学校的药品销售代表一起销售这种药物，这是不容易做到的。

Adora Cheung: I also see this proliferation of startups, maybe, actually, since the beginning of Science Exchange,  where you're helping try to speed up experiments, you're helping speed up trolls, you're helping  speed up getting through the FDA process

张：我也看到了创业公司的激增，实际上，自从科学交流开始以来，你在帮助加速实验，你帮助加速了巨魔，你帮助加快了FDA的进程

And so that may be helping a little  bit as well.

所以这可能也有一点帮助。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, definitely. We've funded some really interesting companies in this space, that put in place,  regulatory infrastructure for the FDA. So the expertise is out there, and people are starting  to productize that, in a way that maybe wasn't available previously. So people would have  to go and hire regulatory consultant, that would be very expensive, literally like more than  $100,000 to come up with your FDA strategy

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，当然。我们已经在这个领域资助了一些非常有趣的公司，这些公司为FDA建立了监管基础设施。所以专业技术已经存在了，人们开始用一种以前没有的方式来生产它。因此，人们将不得不去雇佣监管顾问，这将是非常昂贵的，实际上就像超过10万美元来提出你的fda战略。

And now there are companies that you  can actually go and work with them to provide the productize vision of that process.  So Enzyme is the company that Y Combinator funded, which I think is super interesting.  And all of these are just enabling technologies that will hopefully provide the infrastructure similar  to what we've seen in this office space.

现在有一些公司，你可以去和他们一起工作，为这个过程提供生产远景。所以酶是Y组合公司资助的，我认为这是非常有趣的。所有这些都只是能够提供基础设施的技术，就像我们在这个办公空间里看到的那样。

Adora Cheung: So you've now like we said before advised and you've mentored hundreds of biotech founders  at this point, what are some of the common mistakes you've seen biotech founders make,  and what are the ones that you just need? What do you avoid at all  costs because it's just so detrimental?

张：你现在就像我们之前说过的，你已经指导了数百名生物技术创始人，你看到生物技术创始人犯了哪些常见的错误，你只需要哪些错误？你会不惜一切代价避免什么，因为它太有害了？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是啊

I mean, I think our biotech founders first of all are really amazing, because  they are often those people who have taken that risk and have stepped out of  academia or other very established careers and said, "I'm going to go do this startup  and there isn't really that many role models for me to follow or success stories  for me to follow." So I think they themselves are incredibly impressive

我的意思是，我认为我们的生物技术创始人首先是非常令人惊讶的，因为他们通常是那些冒着这种风险离开学术界或其他非常成熟的职业的人，他们说，“我要去做这个初创公司，我没有那么多的榜样值得我去学习，也没有什么成功的故事值得我去学习。”所以我认为他们自己是令人难以置信的令人印象深刻的

And often I  do office hours with them, and I'm just learning from them

我经常和他们一起办公，我只是向他们学习

I say, "She really  cool." But I think, one mistake I have seen people make is just ..

我说，“她真的很酷”但我想，我看到人们犯的一个错误就是.。

I  think all startup founders do this, it's not doing the killer experiment, not actually just  [inaudible] to the chase and saying, "Okay, these are just the minimal things I need  to do to truly answer the question." And you almost don't want to do it.  Because if it doesn't work, the company's did, and I allow the time push our  companies a little bit, I'm like, "But why haven't you done that experiment? That experiment  would tell you today if this is going to work or not." And I think  it's hard when it's your own company to do that, but the sooner you do  it, the sooner you have enough money to work on something else. Because like we  talked about, with science if you can't get the actual science to work, you really  are in a difficult position.

我认为所有的初创公司创始人都这样做，这不是在做致命的实验，而不仅仅是(听不见的)追逐，说：“好吧，这些只是我需要做的最简单的事情，才能真正回答这个问题。”你几乎不想这么做。因为如果它不起作用，公司就会这么做，我会让我们的公司有一点时间，我会说，“但是你为什么不做那个实验呢？这个实验今天就会告诉你，这是否可行。”我认为这是很难的，当它是你自己的公司，但你做得越早，你就越早有足够的钱去做其他的事情。因为就像我们说过的，科学如果你不能让实际的科学发挥作用，你真的处于一个困难的境地。

Adora Cheung: So say you're a scientist or you're an academic who's looking to get into startups,  I think a lot of people still think maybe you need some business co-founder, tell  me do x, y & z. What do you think about that and should that  be a goal?

张朵拉：如果你是一位科学家，或者你是一位希望进入初创企业的学者，我想很多人仍然认为你可能需要一些商业联合创始人，告诉我做x，y&z。你对此有什么看法，这应该是一个目标吗？

Elizabeth Iorns: No, I don't think that should be a goal, I think ..

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：不，我不认为那应该是一个目标，我想。

I actually do  have a business co-founder, so he will probably be mad if I say that, and  he's great

我确实有个生意的联合创始人，所以如果我这么说他可能会很生气，而且他很棒

And I literally couldn't have built Science Exchange without him. But not because  of his business background, right? Because he's a great co-founder. Because he hassles and figures  stuff out, and we work well together

没有他我就不可能建立起科学交流。但不是因为他的商业背景对吧？因为他是个伟大的联合创始人。因为他费尽心思想办法解决问题，我们合作得很好

I think business, so much of it is  just common sense

我认为生意，大部分都是常识

I used to get so concerned that I didn't have this finance  background

我以前很担心我没有这个财务背景

I didn't know how to read all of the income statements and all that.  And then I realized after a while, "Okay, I'm just going to sit down with  my business co-founder, and he's going to teach me." And so he taught me and  then I was, "Oh, it's so obvious

我不知道如何阅读所有的损益表。过了一会儿，我意识到，“好吧，我要和我的商业联合创始人坐下来，他会教我的。”于是他教了我，然后我说：“哦，这太明显了

It's definitely not rocket science." So I think  the business side, you really as a CEO, when you grow the company, one of  the key skills is actually recognizing the areas that you're good at, and bad at,  and where you should be investing and bringing in top talent

所以我认为商业方面，作为一个首席执行官，当你成长公司的时候，关键技能之一实际上是认识到你擅长的领域，以及你应该在哪里投资和引进顶尖人才。

And so for us,  we recently actually hired a CFO. So a year ago, we hired a CFO, and  that's been, I think good for the company, but also good from a perception perspective.  So as the company reaches a growth stage, actually having that legitimate CFO person does  help you, but from I mean, starting out, you should just find people who really  want to solve the same problem as you, and really care about it, and also  who you really like working with, because that's by far the most important thing.

所以对我们来说，我们最近雇佣了一位财务总监。所以一年前，我们聘请了一名首席财务官，我认为这对公司有好处，但从感知的角度来看也很好。因此，随着公司发展到一个阶段，实际上有一个合法的首席财务官确实对你有帮助，但从一开始，你就应该找到那些真正想要解决和你一样的问题的人，真正关心这个问题的人，以及你真正喜欢和谁一起工作的人，因为这是目前为止最重要的事情。

Adora Cheung: On the flip side, if you're not a scientist, and let's say you're a programmer,  but you're interested in getting into biotech, what should you do? Should I go back  to school, get my PhD? What's the potential path for me?

张：另一方面，如果你不是科学家，假设你是一个程序员，但你对进入生物技术感兴趣，你该怎么办？我该回学校去拿博士学位吗？我的潜在道路是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: That's a good question. Part of me thinks you should go back to school, like,  I think there is this, there's a lot of interest from Silicon Valley in biotech,  people are super interested in even just hacking themselves, this whole movement around really personalized,  understanding all of your own biology

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：这是个好问题。我觉得你应该回到学校，比如，我觉得硅谷对生物技术有很大的兴趣，人们对黑客非常感兴趣，整个运动都是个性化的，了解你所有的生物学

I think it's really cool

我觉得很酷

And I By the  way, I do think that the future of biotech and where I always think about  for reformer and the work that we're doing is I believe that the future will  definitely involve a strong component of user pays. So I think the products that are  developed will have to be in indications that the patients are actually willing to pay  for

顺便说一句，我确实认为生物技术的未来，以及我一直在为改革者考虑的地方，以及我们正在做的工作，我相信未来肯定会涉及到用户付费的强大组成部分。因此，我认为所开发的产品必须有患者愿意支付费用的迹象。

And there's a lot of research at the moment, that's in areas which I  think, are potentially problematic, because they are diseases where people are not really that sick,  or they don't really feel sick

目前有大量的研究，我认为这些领域存在潜在的问题，因为这些疾病并不是真正生病的人，也不是真正感到不舒服的疾病。

And so getting them to adhere to those medications,  very, very challenging

所以让他们坚持这些药物，非常有挑战性

In contrast like things like migraine drugs, actually Amgen's migraine drug has  outperformed, it's predictions in the market by 10 times

相反，就像偏头痛药物一样，安进的偏头痛药物的表现要好于它，它在市场上的预测是它的10倍

And I think that's because people  genuinely go to the doctor because they are debilitated by migraines and they will pay  for those drugs. So I think trying to think about ways that you can focus  on users is good. So anyway, to go back to the question, because I got  sidetracked. About computer programmers, what should they do? I think for biology and actual scientific  research, there is this element of just getting in the lab and truly understanding how  experiments are designed and how to interpret them, which I don't know that you can  just learn from not doing. But then there is a lot of use for for  example, bioinformatics and other analysis tools and platforms where people can get involved without having  lab experience

我认为这是因为人们真的去看医生，因为他们因偏头痛而衰弱，他们会为这些药物买单。因此，我认为，试着考虑如何将注意力集中在用户身上是件好事。所以不管怎么说，回到这个问题上，因为我偏离了方向。关于计算机程序员，他们应该做什么？我认为对于生物学和实际的科学研究，有一个要素就是进入实验室，真正理解实验是如何设计的，以及如何解释它们，我不知道你能从不做中学到什么。但也有很多用途，例如，生物信息学和其他分析工具和平台，人们可以在没有实验室经验的情况下参与其中。

And we do have some successful companies in Y Combinator that are founded  by non-scientific founders that are in the biotech space. So Notable Labs is one that  I think is incredibly impressive. The funders have basically self taught themselves everything about the  sector that they're in, and they're super smart and hungry

我们在YCombinator有一些成功的公司，这些公司是由生物技术领域的非科学创建者创立的。所以值得注意的实验室是我认为是令人难以置信的令人印象深刻的实验室。资助者基本上已经自学了他们所处的领域的一切，而且他们非常聪明和饥饿。

And straightaway when I interviewed  them, I was, "Yeah, they know just as much as PhDs who work in the  space."

当我采访他们的时候，我马上说：“是的，他们和在太空工作的博士一样了解。”

Adora Cheung: Cool. So two more questions. One is, just going back to Science Exchange for a  minute, looking back, of all decisions you've made, in the early days, aside from just  starting the startup itself, that's obviously very critical, but what's a decision you made where  you're looking back, you're, "That was a game changer. That was an inflection point in  my business."

张朵拉：酷。所以还有两个问题。一个是，回到科学交流，回顾一下，你在创业初期所做的所有决定，除了刚刚开始创业本身之外，这显然是非常关键的，但是你在回头看时所做的决定是什么，“那是一个改变游戏规则的决定。那是我生意上的一个拐点。“

Elizabeth Iorns: Wow, that is a good question. Game changer. Actually, I think the decision to do  the Reproducibility Initiative was a game changer, and it was non-obvious. So in some ways,  the Reproducibility Initiative goes against focus

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：哇，这是个好问题。改变游戏规则。实际上，我认为做复制倡议的决定是一个改变游戏规则的决定，这是不明显的。因此，在某些方面，可再生性倡议与重点背道而驰。

It was a distraction, "Okay, we're going to do  this project. But it's not directly related to just going the marketplace." Although the marketplace  was used to run the project. But it was so timely and so high profile  that it did change the branding and the opportunities for Science Exchange in a way  that we never expected

这分散了我们的注意力，“好吧，我们要做这个项目，但这与仅仅进入市场没有直接关系。”尽管市场被用来运行这个项目。但是它是如此的及时，如此的引人注目，以至于它以一种我们从未预料到的方式改变了品牌和科学交流的机会。

And it did open all of the doors that eventually led  to our pharmaceutical partnerships to really like a lot of the success of Science Exchange.  So that was probably one example.

它确实打开了所有的大门，最终导致我们的医药合作伙伴真的很喜欢科学交流的成功。这可能就是一个例子。

Adora Cheung: Interesting

张朵拉：有趣

I did not know. When I saw it, I was like, "Oh, wow, Science  Exchange." I knew it could be big, but it could be this much bigger, because  it just showed what you could do with it.

我不知道。当我看到它时，我说，“哦，哇，科学交流。”我知道它可能很大，但它可能会大得多，因为它只是展示了你可以用它做什么。

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的。

Adora Cheung: Okay, last question is, always my favorite question

张朵拉：好吧，最后一个问题是，总是我最喜欢的问题

In 100 years from now, I mean,  you've been around for seven, eight years now. But in hundred years from now, what  do you think Science Exchange will be?

从现在起的100年里，我的意思是，你已经存在了七年，八年了。但从现在开始的一百年后，你认为科学交流会是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, that is such an interesting question. Because I think if you just think about  what the world will be like in 100 years from now, I'm not sure any  of us have a good answer. But I do think that 100 years ago, the  scientific method existed, and people were doing scientific research, and I think scientific research will  exist 100 years from now. So Science Exchange has always been extremely purpose driven. So  the company's purpose is to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，这是个很有趣的问题。因为我认为如果你想想100年后的世界会是什么样子，我不确定我们是否有一个好的答案。但我确实认为100年前，科学方法已经存在，人们正在进行科学研究，我认为100年后科学研究将存在。因此，科学交流一直是极具目的性的。因此，该公司的目的是通过联系实现科学突破

And so I think, whatever  the world looks like at that time, that's what Science Exchange will be doing

所以我认为，无论当时的世界是什么样子，这就是科学交流所要做的

And  hopefully, we're just providing that infrastructure that enables people to instantly work with whoever they  need to collaborate with in order to make these scientific breakthroughs happen.

希望我们只是提供基础设施，使人们能够立即与任何他们需要合作的人合作，从而使这些科学突破得以实现。

Adora Cheung: It's crazy to think that scientific method was only discovered, invented, or do you want  to call it, just not long ago, which create this explosion of science in general.  Okay, cool. Well, that's all the questions, I have any questions from the audience? Back  there.
Speaker 3: Given that you've touched on reproducibility several times now, and I believe one of the  problems is that, you use statistical methods, you show correlation [inaudible] . But how open  do you think the industry is in terms of taking new approaches that might tend  towards [inaudible] as a research methodology?

张朵拉：认为科学方法只是被发现，发明了，或者你还想称之为它，就在不久前，它创造了整个科学的爆炸，这真是太疯狂了。好吧，酷。好吧，这就是所有的问题，我有观众的问题吗？后面。演讲者3：考虑到你已经多次提到可重现性，我相信其中一个问题是，你使用统计方法，你显示了相关性[听不见]。但是，你认为这个行业在采取新的方法时有多开放，而这些新的方法可能会把[听不见的]作为一种研究方法？

Elizabeth Iorns: So the question is about whether we should look at new approaches too, instead of  just looking at correlations to look for causality, right?
Speaker 3: Especially in a space with unknown unknowns.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：所以问题是我们是否也应该研究新的方法，而不是仅仅看相关性来寻找因果关系，对吗？演讲者3：特别是在未知的空间里。

Elizabeth Iorns: Especially in a space with unknown unknowns. So, I think the way that ... So  I'm a biologist by training. So I tend to think that we're not just looking  at correlations, we try to design experiments that allow us to change something in the  system that is a controlled system, and then read an output from that, and determine  whether that fits of our hypothesis, that we change something, and has therefore had this  downstream impact

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：特别是在一个未知的空间里。所以我觉得.所以我是个经过训练的生物学家。因此，我倾向于认为，我们不仅仅是在研究相关性，我们试图设计实验，让我们能够改变系统中的某个受控系统，然后读取其中的一个输出，并确定这是否符合我们的假设，即我们改变了什么，并因此产生了这种下游影响。

I think there's really interesting work that's been done on correlations, particularly with  real world data. Trying to look for ways that we can actually use humans in  the wild to examine new theories that we have, and then apply those back into  the lab. But at a basic level, when you're in the lab, you are using  model systems to try to reduce the unknown unknowns. So that you can test specific  theories.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
Speaker 4: You talked about how you basically, went from an idea to what was basically a  minimal viable product, in very short space of time, what were they few steps for  you to do that?

我认为在相关性方面已经做了一些有趣的工作，特别是在现实世界的数据上。我们试图寻找在野外使用人类的方法来检验我们所拥有的新理论，然后将这些理论应用到实验室中。但是在一个基本的层次上，当你在实验室的时候，你使用模型系统来尝试减少未知的未知。这样你就可以测试特定的理论了。演讲者3：谢谢。演讲者4：你谈到了你基本上是如何从一个想法变成一个基本可行的产品，在很短的时间内，它们对你来说是什么？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, so the question is about going from an idea to an MVP in a  short space of time, and the steps that required to do that

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，所以问题是要在很短的时间内从一个想法变成一个MVP，以及要做到这一点所需要的步骤。

And for us,  actually, that was one of the lessons that I really took when I started Science  Exchange, was tried to do something really quickly and get it off the ground. Because  I see a lot of people start companies, and they have a lot of enthusiasm  at the start, and then they're also working full time jobs, and trying to do  this on the side

对我们来说，这是我在启动科学交流的时候真正学到的经验之一，我试着做一些非常迅速的事情，并把它做好。因为我看到很多人创办公司，他们在一开始就有很大的热情，然后他们也在做全职工作，并且尝试着去做这件事。

And the progress you make obviously is limited, because you just  don't have the time to put into it. So where possible I think, it's really  great if you can just take time out to say, "Okay, I'm going to do  Y Combinator or something for three months, and really launch the company." So for us,  we literally had the idea, and then I think it was February 2011, and we  were talking about different ideas, and then we thought, "This is really a good idea."  And so then we applied to Y Combinator. So we made this video

而你所取得的进步显然是有限的，因为你没有时间投入其中。所以在可能的情况下，我认为，如果你能抽出时间说，“好吧，我要做三个月的Y组合器或者什么的，然后真正启动公司，那就太好了。”所以对我们来说，我们确实有了这个想法，然后我认为那是2011年2月，我们讨论了不同的想法，然后我们想，“这真的是个好主意。”然后我们应用于Y组合器。所以我们拍了这个视频

And it  was just me and my co-founder, we had nothing, and then actually Y Combinator, Alexis  Ohanian , he Skype me and he said, "You're not going to get in." And  I was, "Oh, no, why?" And he was, "Because you don't have a technical co-founder,  and you really need a technical co-founder." And so we then spoke to all of  our friends

只有我和我的联合创始人，我们什么都没有，然后Y组合，Alexis Ohanian，他用Skype告诉我，“你不会进去的。”我说，“哦，不，为什么？”他说，“因为你没有技术上的联合创始人，你真的需要一个技术上的联合创始人。”于是我们和我们的朋友们谈了谈

And we found a technical co-founder

我们找到了一个技术上的联合创始人

And this was organized in two weeks.  And then we built actually a really hacked together version of the MVP

这是在两周内组织起来的。然后我们建立了一个真正被黑客攻击的MVP版本

And we  came to our interview, and we had already got something, was very basic. But we  had something, and then we got in, and we moved out here in May

我们来到我们的面试，我们已经得到了一些东西，是非常基本的。但是我们有了一些东西，然后我们进入了这里，我们在五月搬到了这里。

And  it was three months of just, "Okay, now let's get that launch." And we were  actually doing transactions off platform. So we actually were talking with all of our scientists,  and I was traveling a lot talking to the people who I could get to  use the product. So we actually did hundreds of thousands of dollars of transactions during  that time, just to prove that we understood the demand and the supply side, and  started to build what would become the product.
Speaker 5: Sou mentioned the case of getting a PhD or something like that, that going back  to school would not be a main thing that you might need to do, but  if you're going into something like biotech, and I guess this is [inaudible] , how  seriously, you take an application, especially in biotech, where there's no doctor of there's nobody  from an established Medical University with an established degree? And then the second part is,  when you go and talk to other scientists, the scientific community, how seriously would they  take you if you do not have those credentials on paper?

三个月过去了，“好吧，现在让我们开始发射吧。”我们实际上是在平台上进行交易。所以我们实际上是在和我们所有的科学家交谈，我经常和那些我可以使用这个产品的人交谈。所以在这段时间里，我们进行了数十万美元的交易，只是为了证明我们了解需求和供应方面，并开始建造成为产品的产品。演讲者5：SOU提到了获得博士学位或诸如此类的例子，回到学校并不是你可能需要做的主要事情，但如果你要进入生物技术之类的领域，我想这是(听不见的)，你是多么认真地对待一个应用程序，尤其是在生物技术领域，在没有博士的地方，就没有一个拥有学位的知名医科大学的人？然后第二部分是，当你去和其他科学家，科学界交谈时，如果你没有这些证书的话，他们会对你有多认真？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, so the question is about the importance of credentials in the biotech space

伊丽莎白：是的，所以问题是证书在生物技术领域的重要性。

And  I think credentials are very important. So if you can have credentials in the space,  it's going to give you obviously a huge advantage. But in saying that, I don't  think it's ... We have examples where people have been successful without that, and how  they were successful is by being incredibly credible themselves when you actually interview them. So  in the example of Notable Labs when I interviewed Matt, and Pete, they just had  researched everything about the space. They'd read every scientific paper, they knew in-depth about cancer  stem cells, about the limitations, about the essays that they wanted to use

我认为证书很重要。因此，如果你能在空间中有凭据，它将给你一个明显的巨大优势。但这么说，我不认为这是.。我们有这样的例子，人们在没有成功的情况下是成功的，当你采访他们的时候，他们是如何获得成功的，那就是他们自己是非常可信的。所以在我采访马特和皮特的著名实验室的例子中，他们只是研究了这个空间的一切。他们阅读了每一篇科学论文，他们深入地了解了癌症干细胞、限制因素以及他们想要使用的论文。

And I  met with them much longer than I would have, if I had a surrogate, which  would be the credential of them having a PhD from a top university. But by  talking to them, it was clear that they did understand the space, and that they  were incredibly motivated, due to a family connection to really try to put something in  place that could help solve this issue, which was, in the case of them, they  were looking for new therapeutics for glioblastoma

如果我有一个代孕母亲的话，我和他们见面的时间要长得多，这将是他们从顶尖大学获得博士学位的资格证书。但通过与他们交谈，很明显，他们确实了解这个空间，而且他们有着难以置信的动力，因为他们的家庭关系确实试图把有助于解决这一问题的东西放在适当的位置上，就他们而言，这就是他们在寻找新的治疗胶质母细胞瘤的药物。

And so I think if you are not  a scientist, having a personal driver of why you're doing this actually can serve as  a surrogate to get you in the door. So it can get you meetings with  top scientists, it can get you meetings with patient advocacy groups that can help you  get the company started.
Speaker 5: So if [inaudible] .

所以我认为，如果你不是科学家，有一个私人的司机来解释你为什么要这么做，那么你就可以成为一个代孕者，让你进入这扇门。所以它可以让你和顶尖的科学家见面，也可以让你和耐心的倡导团体会面，这些团体可以帮助你启动公司。演讲者5：所以如果[听不见]。

Elizabeth Iorns: I think it can

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：我想可以。

I think if you're building a biotech company, you obviously have  to build a scientific team, and then you'll end up with PhDs in your team,  but you can be a co-founder without a PhD.
Speaker 5: Thank you.
Speaker 6: This process of this idea to [inaudible] , when did you decide to leave the  university?

我认为，如果你在建立一家生物技术公司，你显然必须建立一个科学团队，然后你将在你的团队中获得博士学位，但你可以成为一名没有博士学位的联合创始人。演讲者5：谢谢。演讲者6：这个想法的过程(听不见)，你是什么时候决定离开这所大学的？

Elizabeth Iorns: So the question's about when did I decide to leave the university? So I was  so fortunate when I started Science Exchange

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：那么问题是我什么时候决定离开这所大学的？所以当我开始科学交流的时候我很幸运

And I think a lot of people don't  realize how difficult, and I totally don't take this for granted, when people ask me  about our journey of starting Science Exchange

我想很多人都没有意识到这有多难，当人们问我们开展科学交流的历程时，我完全不认为这是理所当然的。

I think we had enormous luck in the  sense that my boss was the Dean of Medicine, at the University of Miami, and  he was incredibly supportive of Science Exchange. So he thought it was a great idea.  He thought that if I didn't do it, then somebody else would do it

我认为我们运气非常好，因为我的老板是迈阿密大学的医学系主任，他非常支持科学交流。所以他觉得这是个好主意。他认为如果不是我干的，就会有人干

And  so he actually let me take three months off to go and do this

所以他让我放了三个月的假去做这件事

And  he looked after my lab for me while I was gone

我不在的时候，他替我照看我的实验室

And then once we're  out here, it was clear that the idea was going to be successful

一旦我们来到这里，很明显这个想法会成功的

And we  raised funding straight out of YC

我们直接从YC筹集资金

And so I decided, I'm not going to go  back

所以我决定，我不会回去

And I was actually nervous about telling him, I wasn't going to go back.  But he was so amazing about it. He was just like, "Yeah, I know it's  doing great

我很紧张地告诉他，我不会回去的。但他太棒了。他说，“是啊，我知道这很棒

I knew it would be a great success." And so having that mentor  who gave me that opportunity, I think not many people get that, especially in academia.  That's actually, again, where I sometimes have this frustration of, I hear the opposite of  PhD students and postdocs, they tell me, "Oh my boss just really didn't want me  to leave. Really didn't want me to start a company." Actively worked against me, rather  than helped me and I think about my experience, and how different it would have  been if I didn't have that support.

我知道这会是一个巨大的成功。“因此，有了给我这个机会的导师，我想没有多少人能明白这一点，尤其是在学术界。这也是我有时感到沮丧的地方，我听到博士生和博士后的相反声音，他们告诉我，“哦，我的老板真的不想让我离开。“积极地反对我，而不是帮助我和我一起思考我的经历，如果我没有这种支持的话，那会有多大的不同呢？”

Adora Cheung: Alright, last question. Right here.
Speaker 7: How exactly did you match the expectations from both sides, what the demand side expected  out of the supply, and the supply, and started to control the quality perception for  both sides?

张朵拉：好的，最后一个问题。就在这儿。演讲者7：你到底是如何满足双方的期望的，需求方对供应的期望是什么，并开始控制双方的质量感知？

Elizabeth Iorns: Yeah, so the question is about quality control, and a two sided marketplace. So for  us quality control was incredibly important, and actually is one of the core value propositions  of Science Exchange. So we qualify all suppliers before they're available through the marketplace

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：是的，所以问题是关于质量控制，和一个双边市场。因此，对我们来说，质量控制是非常重要的，实际上也是科学交流的核心价值主张之一。所以在所有供应商通过市场之前，我们都会对他们进行资格认证

And  then we also have a continuous monitoring process where we actually look at performance of  every single transaction. So we have more data on performance than anybody else

然后，我们还有一个持续的监视过程，在这个过程中，我们实际上查看每一个事务的性能。所以我们比其他任何人都有更多的性能数据。

And we  can actually say with certainty, well at least more certainty than other people, "This provider  will likely do a very good job on this type of experiment." We also put  in place the way our actual platform is structured. There's clear outline of the deliverables  that are generated, the expectations are set upfront

我们可以肯定地说，至少比其他人更肯定，“这个提供者很可能在这种实验中做得很好。”我们还设置了我们的实际平台的结构方式。有清晰的可交付成果大纲，预期是预先设定的

And I think a really interesting stat  that we tracked closely is Science Exchange's Net Promoter Score is 78, and our suppliers,  Net Promoter Score is 67, and the industry average is zero. So we think that's  amazing, because it's the same suppliers, but when used through the platform, they perform much  better

我认为我们密切关注的一个非常有趣的统计数据是，科学交易所的净启动得分为78，我们的供应商净启动得分为67，行业平均为零。所以我们认为这是很棒的，因为这是相同的供应商，但是当通过平台使用时，他们的表现要好得多

And I think the reason is because it's structured and it's clearly outlined, what's  going to be delivered

我认为原因是因为它是结构化的，并且它被清楚地概述了，将要交付的是什么

And then there's an expectation that if you don't perform the  information will actually be available to everyone else, when they're making a decision. So it  becomes a very strong incentive for people to perform and make sure that they're delivering  what they agreed upon.

还有一种期望，如果你不执行，当其他人做出决定的时候，这些信息实际上是对每个人都是可用的。因此，这就成为了一种非常强烈的激励，促使人们去执行并确保他们所达成的协议得以实现。

Adora Cheung: All right. Thank you so much, Elizabeth.

张朵拉：好的。非常感谢伊丽莎白。

Elizabeth Iorns: Sure. Thank you.

伊丽莎白·奥恩斯：当然。谢谢。

Adora Cheung: Thank you everyone.


张朵拉：谢谢大家。
