# A Conversation with Paul Graham - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: Well, thank you for coming this morning. We are trying something a little bit different  this startup school year. We are not just having our weekly two lectures, but we  are having some conversations with notable people, and I couldn't be happier to have one  of the most notable startup people here. He'll get embarrassed when I say anything complimentary,  so I'll try to avoid it. Paul Graham, my friend and the founder of Y  Combinator, back in 2005. And we're just gonna talk, and hopefully it won't be boring.  Paul.
Paul Graham: Yes Jeff.
Geoff Ralston: So, you and I got to know each other strangely at a ... It was  kind of a startup at the time. Yahoo, back in the late 90s.
Paul Graham: 98.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: Do you guys know he wrote Yahoo Mail?
Geoff Ralston: Some of it, yeah.
Paul Graham: Y Combinator has the people who wrote Yahoo Mail and Gmail.
Geoff Ralston: That is weird, right? Paul Bucheit, who actually has more of a claim on actually  writing Gmail than I do have a claim on writing Yahoo Mail. I wrote some  important parts of Yahoo Mail, but Paul was kind of by himself doing Gmail almost.  And we were a little more intentional with Yahoo Mail, and had a team creating  something called Rocket Mail. But it is a little weird that both of us ended  up at YC years later. But Paul was at Yahoo, I was at Yahoo, because  we created something called Rocket Mail, and we were purchased in 97. But Paul's company  was bought in 98. And so, you had this weird idea for a product, for  something that you thought people would want in the mid 90s, which had to do  with sass before sass was a thing. How did you come up with this idea  for Via Web, the company that Yahoo bought?
Paul Graham: Okay. So, what we made was something that is now called a web app. At  the time it was the first one, and that's why the company was called Via  Web, because it worked via the web. And the way ... I remember it very  vividly. We thought ... Back then everybody thought that writing software was identical with writing  software that ran on the client, and were still, for those of you who remember  the mid 90s, the client meant Windows, right? And like, we knew how to write  software for Unix. We liked Unix. We did not know how to write software for  Windows, but we knew enough to know that we did not want to learn. And  so, we were really, really highly motivated to figure out how to write software without  having to write software to run on Windows. And so, we thought to ourselves, well  maybe ... You know, the way I first thought of it actually, was that you  would have this ... It was an online store builder, right? And I thought that  you could send it updates by email. I thought you could send it updates by  email, right? And it would change your website. And then I remember thinking well, if  you-
Geoff Ralston: Poster is for shopping carts or whatever.
Paul Graham: If you can use SMTP, why not HTTP to update your website? Whoa, you could  ... The software could run on the server, and you could control it by clicking  on links in the browser. Would that even work, right? But I remember. I was  like sleeping on a mattress on the floor in Robert's spare bedroom, and I remember  I sat up in bed when I thought of this. Like the letter L, right?  It was actually like one of those scenes in a movie, I'm like oh my  God, we could avoid having to write software on Windows at all. At that point  we were never thinking about the benefits of web apps, which are great. As it  turned out. We were just thinking we could actually do this without ever having to  learn Windows.
Geoff Ralston: So, it's all about avoiding Windows. It didn't matter that you could deploy then without  having to ship software to ... None of that had come to you.
Paul Graham: No, no.
Geoff Ralston: It was just avoiding Windows.
Paul Graham: We could actually write this code-
Geoff Ralston: Thank you Bill Gates.
Paul Graham: ... And we'd never have to learn Windows. Because the Netscape people had already gone  through the pain of making Netscape work on Windows, right? That was like a hole  onto Windows, you know? And people could get through the hole and click on links  in the browser and control the software. And so, we immediately ... We weren't even  sure this would work, because it was so weird. But we immediately sat down and  tried to write this really, really clunky website builder that worked by clicking on links.  It was terrible, but it did actually work. It could make a website, we're like  holy shit, this actually works.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's weird that an innovative idea like that just sort of comes out of  no ... I mean, it doesn't seem innovative now because all websites work that way.  But the first one? That's going from zero to one. How do you ... It  has to happen, right?
Paul Graham: It's very common for ideas. In retrospect, they seem obvious and you sort of ...  historians who weren't there, sort of straighten out all the kinks in the development and  it just seems like oh, they had this. It's like this idea. I always hate  it when people represent startup ideas as light bulbs, you know? Because as well as  being the most cliched metaphor imaginable, it's also false. You don't just have this idea,  and then realize it, right? No, it's more like you have this sort of inkling  that something ... You could do something that somebody else hasn't done before and it's  probably a bad idea, but you're too lazy to learn Windows and so you wanna  do it that way, right? And so, or like Zuch, starting Facebook. Just like let's  see what happens, right? Way implausible that this would ever be a startup.
Geoff Ralston: Which is good for you all. Hopefully some of your ideas seem really implausible. Right?
Paul Graham: I love it when ideas seem implausible in the right way. Over the years. I  mean, I already had, just from being a hacker, a sort of a good nose  for this sort of thing, but it has become refined over all these years of  dealing with startups, and when people have ... I was talking to some people yesterday,  and they were talking about two possible things they could do. And one of them  seemed so ... It seemed like naughty. Not like it was sort of maltreating anyone,  it was just sort of taking advantage of something that seemed like it shouldn't even  be possible, right? Like making this software run on the server and just like, never  ... Making software that seemed to the users to run on their computer, but actually  it was just talking to them through the browser. That kinda naughtiness. And I said  pick that one, because it seems so outrageous, it seems so hilarious.
Geoff Ralston: It seems like there's all these ways we have talking about what's a good idea,  and when you try to match up ideas with them, it's always sort of a  complicated ... It's like, is this idea naughty? Or is it not quite intuitive, or  not so obvious? And it's really always hard to take any particular idea and say  is that the one with potential.
Paul Graham: Well, you can't tell, in fact. That's another thing. It's not just that the outcomes  of startups are hard to predict. I think to some degree they're actually indeterminate. There's  a huge amount of luck involved, you know? And so, I think even if Y  Combinator were as good at picking startups as you could possibly get ... I mean,  in fact you have 150 startups per batch of which maybe five will become giant,  or something like that-
Geoff Ralston: Hopefully five. That would be good.
Paul Graham: Yeah. Well, depends on your definition of giant, right? It's a parallel distribution. More like,  for some definitions of giant, one every five batches.
Geoff Ralston: We'll take five or any definition of giant. We'll be happy.
Paul Graham: So, what was I saying?
Geoff Ralston: You were talking the indeterminacy of ideas.
Paul Graham: Even if you were able to pick perfectly, that doesn't mean you could get the  batches down to only five startups. You probably have to pick 20, I think. Even  if you were perfect.
Geoff Ralston: So, it's hard to know ... There's a strange mix of extraordinary hard work, an  idea that has something to it but is not obvious.
Paul Graham: It's hard for founders to know.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: You don't know yourselves. You don't know yourselves. I mean, you don't know comma yourselves.  Not that you don't know yourselves, although that's also true. So, and that's why it's  good to be a hacker because if you're some business person, and you think I'm  going to work on business opportunities, right? Well, I don't know if this is a  business opportunity so I'm not gonna work on it. Whereas someone who's a hacker, who's  just doing things for the fun of it-
Geoff Ralston: Or because they don't like Windows.
Paul Graham: Right. Yeah. Laziness too.
Geoff Ralston: Laziness is actually in some cases really helpful.
Paul Graham: Some kinds of laziness.
Geoff Ralston: Some kinds of laziness.
Paul Graham: I'm a little scared about this meme escaping into the wild.
Geoff Ralston: Right.
Paul Graham: Can't you just see, can't you just see-
Geoff Ralston: Well, it's true-
Paul Graham: They said laziness is good. He said from the sofa, as he ate another donut,  you know? It would be better if people thought laziness wasn't good, because the laziness,  the kind that people do that's good, they would do anyway, even if they thought  being lazy was bad.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Well, using laziness not in the normal sense of laziness, right? Because if you're  lazy ... There's no such thing as a lazy founder that builds a big company.  But a certain sort of ... It's sort of a reticence to do something for  some reason. We're calling it laziness, but it's not really.
Paul Graham: Avoiding things that seem like gratuitous schleps.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: It makes you ... If you have a natural hatred for gratuitous schleps, then that  produces elegant solutions. You know?
Geoff Ralston: So, 1995 ish, I was trying every single idea I could possibly try to start  some internet business, and I was doing it all by myself. Which was awful. And  what I didn't know how to do was to find people to do it with,  and I kinda ran into a bunch of people and I had no clue whether  they would be good people to start companies with. And I was thinking about your  experience, you said you were sleeping on Robert's floor. You started Via Web with two  fascinating people, Robert Maxwell and Trevor Blackwell, who later-
Paul Graham: Robert Morris.
Geoff Ralston: Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell. Robert Maxwell. Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, and ... That  was a weird mix of names. Anyway. How did you pick them as co-founders? How  did that happen? And when did you decide they would be good co-founders?
Paul Graham: Were they good co-founders? All right.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: Right? They were extremely-
Geoff Ralston: It worked.
Paul Graham: They were extremely truculent co-founders who were very good at programming. But I remember Robert  was not into the whole startup thing the entire way. Whenever he was on the  board, and whenever you get an acquisition offer, the board has to at least consider  it, right? And so, we would get these crap lowball acquisition offers. We'll give you  like two million dollars in our stock, right?
Geoff Ralston: And Robert was like yes.
Paul Graham: No, no. Robert would say ... We would vote on it, and Robert would always  say, "Well, you know, I have to be honest here. This would at least mean  we could stop working on this thing." And so, yes I would take this deal,  right? I made a deal with Robert that if he ever made a million dollars  out of Via Web, he would get an earring. Robert is not the kinda guy  who would enjoy having an earring, let me tell you. And so, as soon as  the deal closed, me and Trevor frog marched him to the place in Harvard Square  where people get their things pierced-
Geoff Ralston: I've never heard this before.
Paul Graham: And we got him an earring. There's photographs on the internet of Robert Morris with  an earring.
Geoff Ralston: I bet he didn't keep it.
Paul Graham: Not for long. We should've specified that. I never thought to specify.
Geoff Ralston: You never thought you'd actually get the million dollars.
Paul Graham: No, no. I really actually did. But I thought he would wear it for a  bit longer. When his fiance saw it, she fell on the floor.
Geoff Ralston: Why did you choose truculent founders? Co-founders?
Paul Graham: So, I chose Robert because he was my co-conspirator in everything. And I don't mean  I was always the lead and he was just the co-conspirator. When he did things,  I would be his co-conspirator too. Like the internet worm of 1988.
Geoff Ralston: Do you guys know, Robert Morris is pretty famous all on his own?
Paul Graham: Yeah. He invented buffer overflow. And I remember when he told me about it, and  I said, "Wow, what a cool idea. You should totally do that."
Geoff Ralston: He was the first famous hacker who really got in trouble, I think.
Paul Graham: Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: Really in trouble.
Paul Graham: He was the way ... It's true. He was the first person to be prosecuted  under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, which ...
Geoff Ralston: So, if you're looking for a co-founder, look at people who've been prosecuted because it  works.
Paul Graham: Yeah. He was actually a convicted felon. The funny thing was-
Geoff Ralston: Okay, this is another meme we don't necessarily want to escape out there, that convicted  felons are what you wanna look for as co-founders.
Paul Graham: If they're convicted for that-
Geoff Ralston: Maybe, yeah.
Paul Graham: It was funny, because the FBI, law enforcement kinda does things by the book, right?  Imagination is a big thing in Sherlock Holmes stories, but not in actually everyday law  enforcement. And so, they have these ... The FBI agent told me, they have these  motive that they look for. Sex, drugs, money, revenge, right? And so, Robert did it  out of curiosity, and that just ... It was just not on the list. Right?  They really had a hard time figuring out what the hell was going on, and  I think even within the government there were lots of people who never understood what  was going on.
Geoff Ralston: So, back to Robert and Trevor, who-
Paul Graham: Oh, so why did I pick Robert and Trevor?
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: So, Robert I picked because I would do everything with him, right? We had all  these schemes. And-
Geoff Ralston: And so you knew you could work with him.
Paul Graham: I knew I could work with him and I knew he was really good. He  was a really good programmer. He could program as fast as he could type. Of  course, this was in C, which is a lot of very verbose language. But he  could program as fast as he could type. He was amazing. If he didn't like  what the operating system would do, he would edit the source, and recompile it, and  then it would do what he wanted.
Geoff Ralston: So, truculence aside, he was exceptional.
Paul Graham: Like when he showed up at Harvard, undergrads were only allowed to have accounts on  the official undergrad computing system off in the science center, and there were all these  real computers in the CS department in the [Aiken] lab, and so they wouldn't give  him an account there. And so, he just walked up to a machine, switched it  to single user with him as the super user, gave himself an account, and then  switched it back. Right?
Geoff Ralston: He was curious.
Paul Graham: Yeah. Well, he also wanted accounts on the right machines. He got kicked ... This  whole thing will be about Robert. Robert's such an interesting character. I shouldn't talk about  this-
Geoff Ralston: He may be more interesting than anything else we can talk about.
Paul Graham: He got kicked out of Harvard as an undergrad for reconnecting Harvard to the internet.  Harvard had been one of the early internet nodes.
Geoff Ralston: Does that sound funny to get in trouble for disconnecting a school from the internet?
Paul Graham: No, connecting it, connecting it.
Geoff Ralston: I mean, for connecting a school to the internet?
Paul Graham: He got in trouble ... Where were we?
Geoff Ralston: We're still trying to figure out why the heck you chose Robert and Trevor.
Paul Graham: Oh, I should tell you though about how he reconnected-
Geoff Ralston: Oh, tell us about the disconnected-
Paul Graham: I'll make it really fast.
Geoff Ralston: No, no. It's okay. We have all day.
Paul Graham: We don't, do we?
Geoff Ralston: No, we don't.
Paul Graham: Okay. How long do we have?
Geoff Ralston: We have enough time.
Paul Graham: We have the same watch.
Geoff Ralston: More or less.
Paul Graham: Robert. So, Harvard was one of the very early internet nodes, and by the time  Robert arrived, as an undergrad, the connection had died from Bit decay. And no one  noticed, right? That's how unimportant the internet was back then, or rather ARPANET, as it  was then called.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it was barely an internet, right?
Paul Graham: And so, RTM spent one whole semester working on getting Harvard reconnected to the internet-
Geoff Ralston: RTM is Robert's-
Paul Graham: Yes, yes. Robert. He didn't do any work for any of his classes, and he  got such bad grades he got kicked out for a year. So, we actually used  that later as a recruiting technique because we knew that ... Because there might be  other people who got kicked out for spending all their time on some project. And  so, we actually went around Harvard and posted up this poster saying did you get  kicked out for working on some project of your own? We'd like to hire you.
Geoff Ralston: I think there's probably something-
Paul Graham: We got a really great programmer that way.
Geoff Ralston: There's probably something-
Paul Graham: He made tons of money off of options because we got acquired during the year,  right? And he enjoyed life out of school so much, I don't think he went  back until he was 25. All right, so why Trevor? Why Trevor? Well-
Geoff Ralston: So, you picked Rob. Robert was the guy you did everything with, and he was  great.
Paul Graham: Okay, so after we'd been doing-
Geoff Ralston: Oh by the way, when you picked Robert, did you know he was gonna be  a pain in the ass in so many ways, as you ... Or was that  a surprise to you?
Paul Graham: Well, I knew he was a pain in the ass. I didn't know the company  was gonna be so hard, and that would bring so much pain in the ass-
Geoff Ralston: So, you didn't realize how hard startups were?
Paul Graham: Let me tell you, the way we got Trevor was very indicative.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: So, a month in, we'd been working on this company for a month, and Robert  rebels. And he says, "We've been working on this company for a whole month, and  it's still not done." I'm like, what have we gotten into, right? And I thought  maybe we need more programmers. And so, I said, "All right, Robert. Who's the  smartest person you know in grad school?" And he said, "Trevor." Right? And I said,  "Trevor?" Right? Because Trevor's one of those people who's a lot smarter than he seems.  And so, but Trevor is actually super smart, and so we went and recruited Trevor,  and he said, "Oh, okay." That's a really good Trevor imitation, actually.
Geoff Ralston: That almost sounded Canadian.
Paul Graham: Trevor has two modes. Oh, okay, and oh, I'm sorry. That's just what he does  when he does something that breaks everything. Which was very common, very common. And so,  we got Trevor. I recruited Trevor to work on the thing. He does nothing for  two weeks, at least as far as I can tell. He just disappears. And then  two weeks later he says, "Come into my office." And he's rewritten all our Goddamn  software in small talk, you know? Is that typical?
Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Paul Graham: So, I said, "All right, Trevor. We're not using that. But do this instead." Right?  And so, Trevor was like this super productive hacking monster.
Geoff Ralston: But you didn't know that in advance. You just trusted Robert, when Robert told you  he was really smart.
Paul Graham: Well, if Robert said he was the smartest, he's definitely the smartest.
Geoff Ralston: But there's kind of a deep lesson in that, in how you pick ... Whether  it's employees or co-founders, it's you find someone you trust, and then find someone they  trust.
Paul Graham: Yeah, although, here's an interesting point. That works better for some qualities than others. Intelligent  people can judge other intelligent people, but trustworthy people cannot judge other trustworthy people. In  fact, trustworthy people are often fooled by untrustworthy people. So, like Kate [Cortos] , our  architect who did this, is like super trustworthy, but she's always fooled by these sneaky  schemers who take advantage of her.
Geoff Ralston: So, I guess that means you take recommendations from people, but then you have to  add your own-
Paul Graham: No, no, no. You could totally trust ... Like if Robert says someone's smart, and  I disagree, I think I must be wrong, right?
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, but you need to-
Paul Graham: It just works for some qualities better than others, this whole recommendation thing.
Geoff Ralston: But if you want them to be trustworthy when they join you as a co-founder  so you have to add that judgment on top-
Paul Graham: For trustworthiness, yes. This whole thing of networking doesn't work. It doesn't. You have to  have someone who can judge whether people are trustworthy, which I am not even good  at. I am not good at. The person who does that for Y Combinator is  Jessica, the social radar. The secret power behind everything.
Geoff Ralston: So, you did hire people at Via Web too.
Paul Graham: Yes.
Geoff Ralston: What did you learn about hiring in your first startup? So, you learned that if  they were getting lousy grades, because they were working on a project, that seemed good.  Which is kinda counterintuitive. A lot of things we seem to do at YC end  up being counterintuitive.
Paul Graham: Startups in general are very, very counterintuitive. And so, that's actually YC exists. If it  was obvious what to do in starting a startup, we wouldn't ... YC couldn't really  add much by teaching people how to do it, right? And so, I often say,  I often in fact, practically every day if I do office hours, I'm reminded of  this. That what Y Combinator does is tell founders things that they ignore, right? So,  we tell people don't hire too fast, and then they go off and hire too  fast, and then they come back later and say, "Oh, I wish we'd listened." But  all the things we tell people, we tell people the counterintuitive stuff, not the obvious  stuff. And then what counterintuitive means is it sounds wrong. And so, they go with  their gut, and do the wrong thing instead, and then hopefully catch the mistake in  time.
Geoff Ralston: Why is it that startups are so counterintuitive?
Paul Graham: You know, that would be very much writing an essay about. That would be worth  writing an essay about. Why startups are so counterintuitive. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know. I could come up with some theories, but I have a feeling  the answer is so interestingly complicated, I would be unlikely to come up with a-
Geoff Ralston: I mean, we were just talking about one of the things that you did write  an essay about, which is somewhat counterintuitive. When you start a startup, and you're like  okay, now I'm gonna grow, and you write a whole bunch of stuff, you're writing  software that helps you grow, and you wrote a whole essay that says don't do  that. Do things that don't scale.
Paul Graham: In the beginning, yeah. Do things that don't scale. Because growth is-
Geoff Ralston: Well, maybe you can start by saying what it means to do things that don't  scale, because I don't know if you guys have read this essay-
Paul Graham: Really? You have not all read-
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, I'm sure you've all read all of Paul's essay, but this is actually very  important, because most of you all have early startups, and when you do an early  startup, its become our mantra at YC, and I've seen it again, and again. You  should not try to do too much in the beginning. You should do things that  don't scale.
Paul Graham: What doing things that don't scale means specifically is doing things in a sort of  handmade artisanal painstaking way. That you feel like yeah, it would be great if you  could do things that way forever, but in the back of your mind, you think  to yourself, well there's no way we can keep doing this and become giant, right?  And what do things that don't scale means is do those things early on anyway,  because if you don't do them, you'll never be big so you've got nothing to  lose. And also, you learn a lot from it. You learn a lot. And so,  I discovered a lot of this things that we teach startups at Y Combinator, or  you teach startups at Y Combinator, I'm retired. I don't know if you know that,  but a lot of things you guys teach startups is are things that I hit  myself, and didn't realize that they were actually common startup lessons. So, one of them  is doing things very manually for your early customers. It's so important to get early  customers that if you have to do a ton of manual stuff, that's okay. You'll  learn a lot from it.
Geoff Ralston: Did you guys do manual stuff at-
Paul Graham: Yes, oh yes. Totally. And we thought oh, we're doing it wrong. This is so  lame. And in fact it was exactly the right thing. We made an online store  builder. You could build a store on the internet and sell stuff, and we would  go to would be customers and say, "Would you like to use our easy online  store builder?" And they would say, "No." And we would say, "But you want an  online store, right?" And they would say, "Yeah." And then they would say, "Well, what  if we use ..." We would say, "What if we used our software for you  to make an online store, and then you could have it. Would that be good?"  And they'd say, "All right." And so, we're like we can't get anyone to use  our software, but at least they're willing to let us use it for them. And  it seemed so lame. I learned so much shit about direct marketing, as it turns  out it's called. We were members of the DMA, the Direct Marketing Association. You know,  in every business-
Geoff Ralston: Card carrying member of the DMA.
Paul Graham: We were, we were. In every business, they have a name for the business that's  not the name outsiders call it. Like fast food. No, no, no, they don't call  it that, they call it fast casual within the industry, right? And in the catalog  business, they used to call the direct marketing industry. Right? So, that's what DMA meant  back in those days, the catalog business. We signed up for every catalog. You know  those catalogs you get in the mail? We would just write an ask for more.  We had this bookshelf full of every catalog, ever.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it seems like almost like if you were building a new search engine, what  you oughta do is have your box out there and then just take all the  searches manually, and get results and throw them out there and see what happens. I'm  trying to think what we did for mail that was manual in the beginning. We  had sort of a manual ad server. We didn't really have ad serving technology. We'd  just throw ads. I wrote it, so it wasn't really good, and we would just  throw them in there. There's a deep lesson there, for people though. What happens if  you think you know the solution, and you build lots of stuff for it, you're  going to be wrong, because you just don't know it.
Paul Graham: Having to use our software myself made it much better, because I would be using  our software to make someone's website, right? And I was also the guy who wrote  the site builder. And so, I would be using it and think to myself ugh,  this is inconvenient. I'd go, in the middle of building their site, I would change  the software and, I mean, ship. As in MV. And that's the great thing about  server based software. Ship is the Unix MV command. So, well no, CP. I would  wanna keep a copy-
Geoff Ralston: You would copy source-
Paul Graham: ... So I could keep editing. But I would change the software in the middle  of using it, and then go back to working on their website, and boy did  that make that ... That made the software much better that I had to use  it.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. So, picking co-founders, you wanna pick the best people who you can somehow believe  are trustworthy. That's probably helpful for a lot of people. I think a lot of  people taking the class are sole founders now.
Paul Graham: Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: Why is it that sole founders, that being a sole founder is so difficult?
Paul Graham: Wow. There's so many different reasons. I think the hardest part is morale. There's no  one ... If you have multiple people, they keep one another going when things are  going badly, and there's no one to cheer you up.
Geoff Ralston: That's what was hard for me. I remember 95, I'd be like I know this  internet thing's gonna be real, but damn.
Paul Graham: Oh, so you were a sole founder?
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Yeah.
Paul Graham: That's why his hair is grayer than mine.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, being a sole founder's hard. It's hard because there's a million reasons why what  you're doing isn't going to work, and mostly you're right. So, it's easy to convince  yourself to ... Paul used to say this, and I always remember it. You used  to say look, you have two choices as a founder. Do you remember what you  would say after that?
Paul Graham: Well, there's so many different cases.
Geoff Ralston: Versions of this. Well, he would say you could either quit, or get rich.
Paul Graham: Yeah. Die or get rich.
Geoff Ralston: Like the company, either version-
Paul Graham: That's what happens with startups, mostly. The company either dies, or [crosstalk] succeeds, you get  rich.
Geoff Ralston: And you know, getting rich can mean you have a nice little business where you're  the boss and you have 20 or 50 employees, or could mean that you're Airbnb,  right? They're both good outcomes. Not as good for your investors, necessarily, but for you,  they're really good. And doing things that don't scale, that's ... And internalizing what that  really means. I was thinking about one of the ... This is sort of a  things that don't scale that we talk about at YC all the time. We say  you're supposed to, for success, you talk to users and write code. You talk, and  if you think about it, talking to users, especially as sort of the founder, doesn't  really scale very well. But that's what it forces you to do, if you have  to do everything that doesn't scale. Forces you to learn.
Paul Graham: Right. In the beginning, you only have 10 customers, you wanna grow 20%. You wanna  grow 10% next week. 10% a week's an ambitious goal. We only gotta get one  more customer. You can go out and do that very manually, right? And then next  week you have 11 customers, you have to get 1.1 customers, right? Which is basically  one, right? U just keep going out there and doing things manually, and as long  as your growth rate is good, it doesn't matter how small the number is because  a constant growth rate means exponential growth, and that means the base number will soon  take care of itself.
Geoff Ralston: I was kinda thinking about what makes companies good, and what makes companies fail. And  I was thinking about maybe how we could talk a little bit about some of  those aspects of how people can kind of figure out how they're doing here. We  have thousands of companies out in startup school land, trying to figure out what to  do next, and whether they're doing the right thing. And whether they're failing, and whether  they're on the right path.
Paul Graham: What makes companies fail most of the time is poor execution by the founders. Right?  We often talk to startups who are worried about competitors, and one advantage of YC  having funded so many companies, you have a really large data set, and how many  companies have been killed by competitors? One? More than one? Out of 1900? Right? So,  I tell startups that basically you have the same protection against competitors that light aircraft  have against crashing into other light aircraft when flying through clouds. You know what the  protection is? Space is large. Right? Those little Cessna's don't have any radar in them,  you know? You can't see in clouds.
Geoff Ralston: This falls under the rubric of counterintuitive advice, because one of the things that happens  all the time is people come up to me and say oh my God, there's  another new company. What should I ... That's in exactly my space. What should I  do?
Paul Graham: Right. And it's sort of like if you're running the 100 meters, right? And suddenly  there appears another lane with another runner in it. What should you do? Run as  fast as you can, just like you presumably were, right? If they're better than you,  they'll win, and if not then you'll win.
Geoff Ralston: And that's a good reminder. Could everyone please silence your phones? If you haven't already.  Yeah, what else? One of the things we do a lot is try to judge,  right? And try to pick who's gonna succeed, and you guys are doing the same  thing, you know? Except you're trying to pick yourselves, hopefully. What is it that makes  startups succeed? That makes startups succeed?
Paul Graham: Well, you have to start with a good founding team, ideally. Not just one person-
Geoff Ralston: That's my question-
Paul Graham: You can do it. You can do it with one person.
Geoff Ralston: Well, I couldn't. I couldn't. I ended up having to join other people. I actually  think the vast majority-
Paul Graham: Oh, you tried ... That was not Rocket Mail that you were-
Geoff Ralston: No, I was tech ... No. It was no way. I couldn't do it. I'm  not built that way. I think most people aren't built that way. Thus my questions  about Robert and Trevor, that it's just so difficult.
Paul Graham: I would not try and start a startup with just myself as the founder. I  don't think I could do it.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. It's lonely enough anyway.
Paul Graham: Maybe you think you can, but I couldn't. So, you need a good solid founding  team who know one another well, and who can work together-
Geoff Ralston: Just like ... Pause there. Knowing one another well, why does that even matter?
Paul Graham: Because what happens in a startup will shake your relationship. If there's any sort of  flakiness or uncertainty, or disloyalty, or whatever lingering in there, it will emerge under the  stresses of a startup.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. It's like a marriage, only harder. You spend more time with that person-
Paul Graham: There's other differences.
Geoff Ralston: There's ... Potentially, yeah. Okay, so you get a good founding team, you get someone  who you can stand stress with.
Paul Graham: So, there's two categories of stuff, there's two categories of answers we could give here.  There's the answer you give to investors about how to pick startups, and then there's  only a subset of that is useful to founders, right? So, you can tell investors,  you wanna pick smart people, right? But founders are as smart as they are if  they've already ... What can we tell them, get smarter? Right? And actually, it turns  out it's not that important to be smart. It's much, much more important to be  determined. If you imagine this hypothetical person who's 100 out of 100 for smart, and  100 out of 100 for determination, right? And then you start taking away determination. It  doesn't take very long before you have this sort of ineffectual brilliant person. Whereas if  you take someone who's super, super determined, and you start taking away smartness bit by  bit, I mean, eventually you get to some guy who owns a lot of taxi  medallions, but he's still rich, right? Or like a trash hauling business or something like  that, but you can take away a lot of smart.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, you have to take a lot of smart and add ... And take away  a bunch of ethics at the same time, and then you get that guy, right?
Paul Graham: He could be president.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I've been thinking about-
Paul Graham: Who thought that Trump would actually teach an important lesson?
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, for startups.
Paul Graham: It's all about determination.
Geoff Ralston: I was thinking about these axes we think about, and those are two. The intelligence  axis or the determination axis. And obviously if you were really intelligent, really determined, that's  awesome. There's-
Paul Graham: Oh, by the way. Only one person has to be super determined.
Geoff Ralston: Right.
Paul Graham: Right? So, you know, you could have one person who really wants to start the  company and one person-
Geoff Ralston: You and Robert.
Paul Graham: Exactly. Who after a month is like what? We're still working on this?
Geoff Ralston: That depends on this tight bond where you can drag that person along with you.  Otherwise, they'll go away. But I was thinking, there's actually another axis, which is you  have to have the ability somewhere on your team to project, because your idea's gonna  suck, and then it'll suck less and less. And so, you have to have the  ability to think where should we ... To navigate. You have to have some sort  of creativity that allows you to make the right choices, and-
Paul Graham: No, no. Actually you might not have to be that creative. If you care enough  about users, you can just follow what will make users happy the way a scientist  follows the truth, and eventually, without much thinking on your part, the need to grow  will give you this product idea that's actually the product, it's the result of evolution.
Geoff Ralston: So, maybe you're either sort of Steve Jobs and can intuit what customers need, or  you just have to have the skill of actually talking to customers and understanding what  their saying, which isn't always obvious.
Paul Graham: Well, you know Steve Jobs' trick was he satisfied users too, except he was the  user. It's like I don't wanna have any phone jack anymore, so no more phone  jacks for anybody. Right?
Geoff Ralston: And maybe he was just lucky that his desires were generic enough that it was  good for everybody.
Paul Graham: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was living in the future.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, except he didn't really like the internet except for reading the New York Times,  so he never really got that right.
Paul Graham: Interesting. Didn't you ... You worked at Apple at one point, after you got  bought.
Geoff Ralston: I did. For six months.
Paul Graham: What was it like? What was Steve like? Could you tell from where you were  in Apple what Steve was like?
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I got to talk to him a few times. He's different.
Paul Graham: Tell us, tell us how. Are there useful lessons you can learn from him? Or  is he a one-off?
Geoff Ralston: I wouldn't presume ... I only met with him a handful of times, and I  wouldn't presume to know too much about him-
Paul Graham: Yeah, you had a lot of indirect evidence in stories and stuff like that.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: Do you ever see founders at YC? You think to yourself ooh, this is like  Steve Jobs.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I don't think we'd fund a Steve Jobs at YC.
Paul Graham: Well, that's not good.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. And the reason is, especially when Steve Jobs was starting off, he was an  asshole.
Paul Graham: Oh, I think actually you would fund him because Steve Jobs would make you fund  him.
Geoff Ralston: Maybe.
Paul Graham: Right?
Geoff Ralston: We try to avoid people who seem like they're assholes, and I think ... You  wrote a whole essay on being nice.
Paul Graham: Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: The [Ronco] Principle, right?
Paul Graham: There's a couple.
Geoff Ralston: A couple, yeah.
Paul Graham: One is about that.
Geoff Ralston: About being nice, yeah.
Paul Graham: There's also one called Be Good.
Geoff Ralston: Be good, right. And I don't think he would have passed the test, especially when  he was younger. Which is ... I worry about that because it's true that it's  usually good to be nice, and friendly, and benevolent. He wasn't.
Paul Graham: Maybe if YC had caught him early.
Geoff Ralston: We could've helped?
Paul Graham: Maybe.
Geoff Ralston: But maybe that was part of what made him successful in the beginning, I don't  know.
Paul Graham: I don't know, I don't know.
Geoff Ralston: It worked for Donald Trump.
Paul Graham: Donald Trump, that's a different kinda business.
Geoff Ralston: That's a bad example, right?
Paul Graham: Yeah. Donald Trump is a name we should avoid. In business, determination matters more, but  business is not identical with startups.
Geoff Ralston: I wanna leave these guys some time to ask questions. But I want ... What  are they gonna get wrong? What mistakes will these people make that maybe, maybe hearing  them might help? It probably won't because you won't listen, but-
Paul Graham: What you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention to users.  You will make up some idea in your own head that you will call your  vision, and then you will spend a lot of time thinking about your vision in  a café, by yourself, and write, build some elaborate thing without going and talking to  users, because that's doing sales, which is a pain in the ass, and they might  say no, and you'd be way better off finding someone, anyone, who has a problem  that they will pay you to fix and fixing it, and then seeing if you  can find more people like that. Best case is if you yourself have the problem,  right? But you will not ship fast enough, because you don't wanna face the ...  You're embarrassed to ship something unfinished, and you don't wanna face the likely feedback that  you will get from shipping.
Geoff Ralston: It's humbling and humiliating when they tell you how shitty what you've built actually is,  right? But that's the only way you get it better.
Paul Graham: Yeah. So, you will shrink from contact with the real world. Or contact with your  users. That's the mistake you will make.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. There's a Paul Graham-ism in there which is all around launching fast, launching before  you're ready. I sometimes tell people the story of-
Paul Graham: It's Reed Hoffman, actually, who hounded ... Who harped on that one early. Not me.  I think he said if you're not embarrassed with what you launched, then you launched  too late.
Geoff Ralston: I remember when I was joining Y Combinator, and at the same time, this is  not necessarily a good idea, launching Imagine K12, this ed tech version of YC, and  I came in to talk to Paul, and he's like so, how's it going with  Imagine K12? Because he helped out a lot, and I said, "Oh, it's going well"-
Paul Graham: I think it was probably called something else at that point.
Geoff Ralston: Well, no, no, no, it was still ... By then, you'd already ... He actually  gave us the name Imagine K12, and so it was called Imagine K12, and was  like when are you gonna launch? And I was like well, working on our PR  plan, and we're finishing the software, so ... This was like ... We were gonna  have a summer batch, and this was probably in February or something, and I said,  "Probably in like six weeks." He said, "Why don't you just launch? Why don't you  just launch now?" And I was like, damn. He just did it to me. And  we did, we launched within a week, we launched. And so, that is a mistake  you'll make. You'll wait too long, you'll be embarrassed. You'll ...
Paul Graham: We launched YC probably in less than a week of having the idea. Of course,  launching it was merely posting a website, and we didn't have any software in the  beginning. We just had this [ascii] form that people would fill out and reply to  us by email. The first couple of batches, the applications were by email. And we  would print them out, and pass them around amongst the partners, and we would all  write grades on the top, like we were grading papers. And then we would sort  this heap of papers, and that was the application process.
Geoff Ralston: Talk about doing things that don't scale. Try to do that with thousands of applications  now. It would be harder. So, we have lots of software that does that, because  eventually you scale.
Paul Graham: Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: Eventually you build software when you learn what software you oughta be building. It'd be  fun to spend a lot of time, more time, talking about how YC got started,  but I think rather than that-
Paul Graham: How much time do we have left?
Geoff Ralston: We can probably go to around 12, and ... Videos that get too long are  no one wants to watch anyway, so we're already been going for about 40 minutes  or so. So, let's open up to any questions you guys might have. Yeah.
Speaker 3: My question is about hiring co-founders. So, in the complex B says most likely you  have a lot of very successful friends that might wanna join you, and you kinda  work with them in building something. But you're risking losing basically that person, and if  you run out and hire someone from the street who's a co-founder, and technically savvy,  then you might risk him breaking the company later, you know? So, it's kind of  like sometimes it's more risk actually-
Paul Graham: Are you saying that if you recruit your co-founder, your friends as co-founders, you might  lose them as friends?
Speaker 3: I mean-
Paul Graham: I don't think that that's a big danger. I don't think you have-
Geoff Ralston: So, the question was should I have my friends be co-founders and then maybe risk  losing them as friends? Or should I just take someone off the street where I  don't have the risk of losing them as friends, but they might break my company.  Was that your question? Did I get that right?
Speaker 3: Yes you did.
Paul Graham: I already answered it, dude. Come on.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, I just wanna make sure they heard the question too, just because-
Paul Graham: I repeated the question.
Geoff Ralston: Yes. Go.
Speaker 4: How do you deal with different ... So, I guess it's a two part question.  One is, how do you deal with different commitment levels with being co-founders? And also,  if you had to fire a co-founder, how would you go about it?
Geoff Ralston: How do you deal with different commitment levels of co-founders, and if you do have  to fire a co-founder, what should you do?
Paul Graham: Okay. So, the way you deal with different commitment levels is you ask yourself would  I rather have 30% of this person, or 100% of some other person? And in  my case, I would rather have 10% of Robert Morris' brain than 100% of almost  anybody else's. So, it was an easy decision. How do you fire co-founders? In Y  Combinator, the answer is you ask Carolyn [Levy] . Because Y Combinator, there's so much  experience with dealing with crap like firing co-founders, and you just go and talk to  them and they say, "Here, you do this, and this, and this", right? How do  you-
Geoff Ralston: And it's probably online, too. So, you could Google it.
Paul Graham: Really? Has YC published how to fire co-founders?
Geoff Ralston: Well, we have published ... If you look at some of the talks Carolyn has  given, and Christie, I'm pretty sure they've covered that particular issue. One way you deal  with it, by the way, is making sure that someone has a little bit more  stock per ... It's usually better to have somewhat equal shares, but not completely equal,  and if one person has 51% and the other person has 49%, then they can  have control.
Paul Graham: You at least don't get deadlocked.
Geoff Ralston: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 5: So, when you talk about launch, is launching to private beta, a couple of people,  good enough? Or do you have to just launch it to public?
Geoff Ralston: So, what does launch really mean?
Paul Graham: So, the question is, is launching in a private beta to a few people good  enough? Or do you have to launch to the general public? I will take launching  in just a private beta to a couple people, because that's closer to full launch  than just sitting thinking of your idea in a café.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Paul Graham: Next. Yes.
Speaker 6: What do you think about the current fundraising and project structure with projects were ...  a bunch of projects have maybe over raised, or basically the-
Geoff Ralston: Are you asking about ICOs? Yeah, what do you think about ICOs, Paul?
Paul Graham: I have ... I know nothing about this world. I've heard there's a huge amount  of Crypto money floating around. So, if there's money floating around, it's often a good  idea for startups to try and get it. Beyond that, I don't know.
Geoff Ralston: But I will say, one of the things we've seen a lot at Y Combinator  is it's not always right to raise too much money. And even if you don't-
Paul Graham: By definition of too, it's always wrong.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I'll raise a lot of money, and the thing about ... There's a couple  reasons for that. One, you dilute more than you necessarily need to. But the other  reason is that money just sitting there has sort of a gravitational effect.
Paul Graham: It makes you-
Geoff Ralston: It makes you spend fast. And it makes you do stupid things, so it's like  ... There's companies that have raised a billion dollars on ICOs and I don't know  if they'll ever have a real company.
Paul Graham: Or you get a bunch of LPs and raise a billion dollars, and then you  just hire so many more people than you actually need, right?
Speaker 7: It's usually not equity though. It's usually not equity.
Geoff Ralston: That's what I was saying. That's the difference with ICO. I get it, but just  having a billion dollars when you only barely have an idea is not necessarily ...  Magic Leap raised 2.3 billion dollars, and they seem to have almost nothing.
Paul Graham: By the way, that is the trick for getting your question answered. I learned that  a long time ago. You raise your hand as people are finishing the proceeding question,  and I see that guy's hand over there. He knows the trick. Go ahead. What  is it?
Speaker 8: What are your best tips for a great user interview?
Paul Graham: My best tips for a great user interview? Well, you wanna figure out not just  what they think is wrong, but what's actually wrong. What's missing in their life, right?  So, just start talking to them. Say what would you like to do? What would  you like to be able to do that you can't? And they might just ...  they'll tend to give you an answer that's like a subset, right? Like if you  were asking someone about email, they'd like to say I like ... It's really important  to me to be able the mark emails as unread, right? I'm like, what does  it mean unread? That whole unread thing is a sign the whole inbox is being  misused. What's really going on is it's a to-do list, you know? And that's why  you have to mark items as unread so they stay on your to-do list. And  so, you could ... So you start asking them with what's wrong, and then you  try and figure out what they really mean, what they're really getting at, which they  themselves might not know, you know? And then you start asking them so, what if  you could do such and such? What if you could do such and such, right?  So, start by asking them questions about their life, and then get hypothetical on them.  Okay, we should ask someone on this side.
Geoff Ralston: You've taken over, so you just keep calling them. You're doing great. You pick. Go  ahead.
Paul Graham: All right. Right there in the way corner.
Speaker 9: This is actually kind of off one of the questions that somebody else asked earlier.  So, you talked about launching early, right? How do you justify the financial risk and  turbulence because of launching a shitty product?
Paul Graham: How do you justify the financial risk of launching a shitty product?
Speaker 9: Not entirely shitty product, or something half baked rather.
Paul Graham: Okay. So, the risk of launching early is not as great as the risk of  launching late. It's not like there's only risk on one side, right? There's a risk  of launching late, too. So, you gotta have a rule of thumb about when to  launch, and my rule of thumb, the way I ... I have this phrase for  it that didn't become as sticky as minimum viable product, because it describes what the  minimum viable product has. But it's a quantum of utility, right? Launch as soon as  you have a quantum of utility, which means as soon as there's one person in  the world who is glad that you launched, because now they can do something that  they couldn't do. If you have something that if you launched it, no one would  be happy, then you're not ready to launch, right? As soon as there's at least  somebody out there who would say oh, here's this thing I can use, because I  can do X, and before that I couldn't do it, then you should launch. As  soon as you have a quantum of utility.
Geoff Ralston: It sounds like there's almost utility function. Like if it makes too many people happy,  and one person happy, and 100 really unhappy, maybe it's not ready. But if you  ... Paul Bucheit always says if you have 10 people who really love your product,  that's a good place to be.
Paul Graham: Yeah, all you need is ... If there's 10 people who are super excited, totally,  totally launch. And nobody else cares, that is perfectly fine, that is great. Okay, yes.
Speaker 10: Can you talk about the difference between the [inaudible] build what they want versus what  customers need? So, most of the time the want maybe very short sighted, whereas the  need maybe people are wanting, they have some unintended consequences. So, how do you deal  with building what they really need versus what they really want?
Paul Graham: Well, the danger of building ... Okay, so the question is how do you decide  between building what people need and building what people want, right? Well, the problem is  what you really wanna be doing is build something people will choose to use, or  buy, or become your user, or something like that. And so, here's a counter example  to the whole need versus want thing. What people need is healthy food. What people  buy is unhealthy food. So, if you're a business, which one do you wanna do,  right? I mean, yeah, ideally you wanna make health food that also tastes good, right?  But really, you can't push this too far. You can't push this too far. I  mean, I myself would not start some company making junk food or something like that,  but if you are making food, don't ... Or something where need and want are  very different, be real careful about picking need, you know? Or you'll go out and  you know, your goal will be to cleanse the world of sin, or something like  that.
Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's easy to delude yourself as a founder to think you're building something-
Paul Graham: Yeah. The other danger is what they need is what you think they need. What  you're implicitly talking about is what you think they need. Cleanse the world of your  definition of sin, right? Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 11: My name is [inaudible] , I'm working on smart technologies. My question is, when I'm  work on my project, sometimes I'm seeing different problems and different, my mind, thinking different  solutions. Is that normal as a founder?
Paul Graham: Is it normal as a founder to see multiple different solutions? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. You  just have to pick one. Pick the one that you think could get usage quickest.
Speaker 11: [inaudible] . What's a founder DNA?
Paul Graham: What's the founder DNA?
Speaker 11: Explain founder DNA.
Paul Graham: Founder DNA.
Speaker 11: Founders DNA, basically character, and-
Geoff Ralston: Oh, what makes someone a founder?
Speaker 11: Yes.
Geoff Ralston: They choose to be one.
Speaker 11: And what was your explanation?
Paul Graham: What makes someone a good founder? A combination of positive and negative things, I think.  Positive things are things like determination, and willingness to try new things. But then there  may also be negative things. Like if you are ... I think if you have  worked for a large company for 20 years, you might not be a founder unless  you were forced to for Visa reasons, because if you were the kind of person  that would make a good founder, you wouldn't be able to stand working for a  large company for 20 years, right? And so, actually we've noticed certain companies where the  alumni of these companies tend to make bad founders, and it's because no one who  would make a good founder could have stood working for these companies for very long.  Okay, maybe we should pick one on this side.
Geoff Ralston: We'll take a few more questions.
Paul Graham: Okay, yes, go ahead.
Speaker 12: Okay, the question is pricing during launch is especially important to me because I have  a successful offline business that I'm taking online. The overall question for of us is  any strategies about pricing during launch?
Paul Graham: What do you price during launch? Well, you can probably guess. If you know your  business, you know roughly what you should charge, so you should probably just go with  whatever you guess. If you wanna be more scientific about it, you could try talking  to some potential users. Most of the time you have some sort of tame users  who are actual users, but are also friends of yours or something like that, or  family, and you can ask them. Tell me honestly, what would you actually pay for  this, right? You can always change your prices later, though. If you wanna lower your  prices, no one's going to complain. And if you wanna raise your prices, you just  grandfather your existing users, which if you have exponential growth will always be a tiny  subset of your total users, and then no one will complain about that either. So,  don't sweat about it too much.
Geoff Ralston: One way I think about that is it just seems like in the beginning what  you need more than anything is customers, and you want them to pay. So, you  need to pick a price that gets you customers, because you'll learn so much from  those customers, and you can change later, right?
Paul Graham: Definitely don't overcharge. Don't lose-
Geoff Ralston: Get customers.
Paul Graham: ... Users over price. Yeah. Because in the beginning you just want growth. Because the  customers teach you. The first customers don't just give you money, they teach you.
Geoff Ralston: All right, two more questions.
Paul Graham: You pick two.
Geoff Ralston: Okay, right up front here.
Karen: Angel investing. So, my name's Karen, and I'm with Chat Goose, and which is a  chat manager. So, three tips for dealing with and finding angel investors, if you don't  have the rich uncles, et cetera.
Geoff Ralston: Well, we never talked about fundraising at all, wow. Maybe we'll have to do this  whole thing again.
Paul Graham: That's good. Fund fundraising is a thing to occupy your thoughts as a founder. It's  overrated. It's better not to be spending all your time thinking about fundraising.
Geoff Ralston: And we come to it much later in the class, so we don't need to.
Paul Graham: All right. So, the question was how to find angel investors? Well, that's the thing,  I'm particularly ill-suited to answering that question, because Y Combinator is like this machine for  funneling angel investors into all the startups that it accepts. So, how do you find  angel investors if you don't? It's like asking a pilot how to walk along a  track on the ground. I know the least about that.
Geoff Ralston: Here's the thing, angel investors are looking for you. So, get out there. Go to  ... I don't know. Well, there's lots of startup events, angels are ... They're not  necessarily good angels, but angels are out there looking, and look, the best way to  actually meet angels is to get one to invest in you and then to introduce  you to people they know.
Paul Graham: Oh actually, I know the answer to this. I know the answer. Find people who  work at startups and ask them to introduce you to their investors. That's the way  to do it.
Geoff Ralston: That's a good answer. Okay. Last question, Paul, you get to choose, maybe from this  side.
Paul Graham: Okay, right there.
Speaker 14: It's a trend in the valley where companies are starting to hire people without college  degrees. Are you guys thinking of going after high school students to fund?
Paul Graham: Is YC thinking of going after high school students to fund? Well, I don't know,  because I don't think on behalf of YC anymore. But you better not be. Because  that would be an evil thing to do. High school students could ... There are  plenty of high school students who could start successful startups, but they shouldn't. Just because  you could start a successful startup doesn't mean you should, because if you start a  successful startup, that means the footloose and fancy free days of your life are over,  right? You're working for that company.
Geoff Ralston: We have funded kids in high school, but only because they're already going. We're not  encouraging ... I agree, to go to high school and encourage kids to do this  incredibly hard thing instead of having fun, and being kids, that's awful. I actually think  that it's-
Paul Graham: It's premature optimization too, right? What you should be doing when you're in high school,  and even college, is you should be figuring out what the options are, not picking  one option and running with it. Right?
Geoff Ralston: And it just turns out that usually people who are in school and stop to  start companies ... There are dropouts from Harvard, we know the classic examples, but if  you drop out and just go do it, and you're on a path, that's one  thing. But most people, they're dabbling, and they have a fallback, and that's not a  good way to be a startup founder. You have to be 100% committed. And so,  we'll fund people in college, maybe even high school if they're already clearly 100% committed.  Otherwise, no. Whatever trend ... I think that trend you're talking about is that you  graduate from high school, and why bother getting a college degree because you're already a  fantastic hacker, so I'm going to hire you. And if that person wants to enter  the professional workforce, well, that's great.
Paul Graham: I don't know. I was ... I don't think it would've been good for me-
Geoff Ralston: It wouldn't have been good for me either, but-
Paul Graham: To go off and start some startup-
Geoff Ralston: I do think between 18 and 22, you grow a lot as a human being,  who's human, and humane. And it's not clear what society will turn into if all  those folks enter the workforce.
Paul Graham: It's good to mess around and do a whole bunch of different things in your  early 20s.
Geoff Ralston: If you can afford it, yeah.
Paul Graham: Whether this messing around and doing a whole bunch of things takes the form of  college or something else, just don't ... Be careful. Because starting a startup is like  catching a dragon by the tail if it works. Right? Be careful at what point  in your life you do that.
Geoff Ralston: Paul, thank you very much for coming in.
Paul Graham: Thank you, Jeff.
