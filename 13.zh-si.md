# A Conversation with Aileen Lee - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: Alright. Good morning everyone.

Geoff Ralston: 好的。大家早上好。

Audience: Good morning.

观众:早上好。

Geoff Ralston: We are halfway through Startup School. Can you believe it? Already. Wow. Yeah. Or more correctly, we will be after this week.And this is going to be a great week of talks, lectures conversations. Today, we have Tyler from Clever, who's going to give a talk on how to sell, to begin with.And afterwards Harj and Ammon from Triplebyte are going to talk about how to build an engineering organization. Two pretty important things if you want to build a successful company.

Geoff Ralston: 我们已经过了一半的创业学校了。你能相信吗?已经开始了。哇嗯或者更准确地说,我们将在这周之后,这将是一个伟大的一周的会谈,讲座对话。今天,我们有来自聪明公司的泰勒,他将首先做一个关于如何销售的报告。然后,来自Triple字节的Harj和Ammon将讨论如何建立一个工程组织。如果你想要建立一家成功的公司,有两件非常重要的事情。

I will start off quickly with my usual administrivia. We will shortly be sending out a midpoint feedback form for you guys to fill out. We really would appreciate getting as many responses as possible. This is our form of talking to our customers, you all, and getting feedback. We're always trying to improve Startup School, we hope to do it every year and make it better every year. So please tell us what you think and what you think we should change.

我将从我通常的管理方式开始。我们很快就会发出一份中点反馈表给你们填写。我们真的很感激得到尽可能多的回复。这是我们与客户交谈的方式,你们所有人,并得到反馈。我们一直在努力改进创业学校,我们希望每年都能做到这一点,并且每年都能做得更好。所以请告诉我们你的想法和你认为我们应该改变什么。

Adora and I were talking a little bit about updates.

阿多拉和我谈了一些关于更新的话题。

And I've talked to a bunch of people live, and some on the forum about updates and what makes sense for updates.

我和一群人聊过,还有一些人在论坛上讨论了更新和更新的意义。

And just to put it bluntly, think hard about your metrics, the ones you're using. Do not use bullshit metrics. What is a bullshit metric? It's a metric that doesn't really measure the road to success for you.

直截了当地说,仔细考虑一下您正在使用的度量标准。不要使用狗屁指标。什么是狗屁指标?这是一个不能真正衡量你成功之路的指标。

It's something you're making up.

这是你在编造的东西。

Any startup that you're building is an enormous, complicated, difficult, crazy task.

你正在创建的任何一家创业公司都是一项巨大的、复杂的、困难的、疯狂的任务。

And no matter what you're doing, if there is no milestone on the way to achieving that enormous task, then you're kidding yourself and it's not really a step on the way to success. Those milestones are more than anything for you. For you to measure that you're making progress towards your goal. So don't make stuff up because you think that's what we want to hear. Or just because you're bored, they won't help you. Okay.

不管你在做什么,如果在完成这一艰巨任务的道路上没有里程碑,那你就是在自欺欺人,这并不是迈向成功的一步。那些里程碑对你来说是最重要的。来衡量你正在朝着你的目标前进。所以别瞎编,因为你认为这是我们想听的。或者只是因为你无聊,他们帮不了你。好的。

As always problems et cetera, email to startupschool@ycombinator.com.

如往常一样,请发电子邮件至StartupSchool@yCombinator.com。

And with that, I think, Tyler, we are ready to go. So, my good friend Tyler Bosmeny, from Clever.

有了这个,我想,泰勒,我们准备好了。所以,我的好朋友泰勒·博斯梅尼,聪明的。

Tyler Bosmeny: Hey everyone.

大家好。

It's an honor to be here, speaking with you today. Thanks for having me. My name is Tyler Bosmeny.

很荣幸今天能在这里和你们谈话。谢谢你邀请我。我叫泰勒·博斯梅尼。

I'm the CEO of a company called Clever.

我是一家名为“聪明”的公司的首席执行官。

And I wanted to talk to you about something that I think is one of the most fundamental and important things any founder needs to master, which is sales.

我想和你们谈谈一些我认为是任何创始人需要掌握的最基本和最重要的事情之一,那就是销售。

And before I get started and share some of the things I've learned and picked up over the way, I thought it might be helpful to share my own personal journey to sales as something that I've come to learn and just really appreciate and respect as a craft. When I was in school, when I was in college, I was a math major. My graduate degree was in statistics.

在我开始学习和分享一些我学到的东西之前,我觉得分享我个人的销售之旅可能会很有帮助,因为我是来学习的,只是真正欣赏和尊重作为一种手艺的东西。当我在学校,当我在大学,我是一个数学专业。我的研究生学位是统计学。

I was the last person I ever thought would ever do sales.

我是我最不想做销售的人。

And so my own journey to getting here was I was working on the college newspaper, I joined the college newspaper, it seemed like a fun thing to do.

所以我到这里的旅程是我在大学报社工作,我加入了大学报纸,这似乎是一件有趣的事情。

I had some friends who were on it.

我有几个朋友在上面。

And one of the roles they had open was they needed somebody to run the advertising for the newspaper.

他们所扮演的角色之一就是他们需要有人为报纸做广告。

And so I was spending in college hours a day, figuring out how to sell ads to local businesses, so we'd have enough money to print and put out the paper every day.

所以我每天花在大学里,想办法把广告卖给当地的企业,这样我们就有足够的钱每天印刷和发布报纸了。

And doing this for several years, if you know anything about college newspapers, you know one of the things, the biggest determinant of how much money they make every year is how well the economy is doing, because lot of the ads are for recruiters. But I just happened to be there during some very good years.

几年来,如果你对大学报纸有任何了解,你就知道其中一件事,他们每年赚多少钱的最大决定因素是经济状况如何,因为很多广告都是为招聘人员做的。但我只是碰巧在那里的一些非常好的几年。

And when I was leaving the advertising sales team, we set records for The Crimson and so we sold a lot of ads.

当我离开广告销售团队时,我们为“深红”创造了记录,所以我们卖出了很多广告。

And so I thought, "Okay, this is interesting, it's an interesting craft." And then as I was getting ready to graduate school, getting ready to graduate go off to college, excuse me, go to work.

于是我想,“好吧,这很有趣,这是一种有趣的工艺。”然后,当我准备去研究生院,准备毕业,去上大学,不好意思,去工作。

I'm doing math, I'm thinking, you go off to finance, do a hedge fund something like that.

我在做数学,我在想,你去金融,做一个类似的对冲基金。

A buddy starting a company and he says to me, "Tyler, I need you to come join because you're the only person I know who knows how to do sales." And let me tell you I was offended. This was not how I saw myself. This was not you know what I imagined doing after school, but I was also really intrigued.

一个伙伴创办了一家公司,他对我说:“泰勒,我需要你加入,因为你是我唯一知道如何做销售的人。”我告诉你我被冒犯了。我不是这样看自己的。你不知道我放学后想做什么,但我也很好奇。

And I was really good friends with this guy.

我和这家伙是很好的朋友。

And I said, "Why the heck not?" So I ended up going on a very different path and joining his startup building a sales team, we were selling to newspapers across the country. And if you've ever worked with or thought about newspapers before, you can imagine they are very hard customers to sell to.

我说:“为什么不呢?”于是,我走上了一条完全不同的道路,加入了他的创业公司,组建了一个销售团队,我们向全国各地的报纸销售。如果你以前和报纸合作过或者想过报纸,你可以想象它们是很难卖给客户的。

And so I really cut my teeth and have a lot of fun, frankly, over many years figuring out how to sell into this market.

所以我真的切了我的牙齿,并得到了很多乐趣,坦率地说,多年来,我想出了如何在这个市场上销售。

And we sold to a lot of newspapers. Then fast forward a little bit and I come on to start Clever and one of the co-founders started through Y Combinator about six years ago.

我们卖给了很多报纸。然后再往前走一小步,我开始聪明起来,其中一位联合创始人在六年前通过YCombinator开始工作。

And if you don't know anything about Clever, we're a single sign on platform used in schools, and today, over half the schools in America use Clever and so we've really done a lot of selling and really had to figure this out once again in a different context.

如果你对聪明一无所知的话,我们在学校使用的平台上是一个单一的标志,而今天,美国有一半以上的学校使用聪明,所以我们真的做了大量的销售工作,并且不得不在不同的背景下再一次解决这个问题。

And so, I was thinking about, what would be most helpful to talk about, what I'd most want to hear in your shoes, or what I most would have appreciated knowing when I was first starting to cut my teeth on sales.

所以,我在想,什么是最有用的,什么是我最想在你的鞋子里听到的,或者我最想知道的,当我第一次开始在销售中割断牙齿的时候。

And so that's what I want to share with you today.

这就是我今天想和你们分享的。

It's just things I've picked up along the way. Some observations I've had, and hopefully some practical tips that you can take home and implement, as you get your startups off the ground running sales. Sales has a lot of mystique and a lot of lore around it. Or at least it did to me when I was thinking about sales early in my career. When we think about sales and we think about sales people, a lot of us picture Don Draper, we picture these people who are so charming, so impossibly funny, who they always have the right line at the right moment to win the deal, they're of course, incredible golfers This is how sales is portrayed in every movie, in every TV show.

只是我一路捡到的东西。我有一些观察,并希望一些实用的技巧,你可以带回家和实施,当你得到你的初创企业在地面上运行销售。销售有很多神秘感和很多知识围绕着它。或者说,至少在我职业生涯早期考虑销售的时候,它就对我产生了影响。当我们想到销售和销售人员时,我们中的很多人都是唐·德雷珀,我们想象这些人是如此迷人,如此可笑,他们总是在合适的时机拥有正确的路线来赢得这笔交易。当然,他们是不可思议的高尔夫球手-这是每部电影,每一部电视节目中的销售形象。

And so a lot of people go through life thinking that this is what sales is about.

所以很多人都认为这就是销售。

And because we build up this mystique of what sales is, and the types of people who can do sales, I hear founders say very often things like, "Well, right now we're just building the product.

因为我们建立了销售是什么以及能够做销售的人的神秘,我听到创始人经常说,“好吧,现在我们只是在制造产品。”

And once it's finished, then we'll go and hire the sales people." Well, guess what? Hire the sales people. That's you.

一旦完成,我们就去雇佣销售人员。“好吧,你猜怎么着?雇销售人员。就是你。”

And that looks nothing like the mystique and it looks nothing like the lore in my experience. This is my co founder, Dan and the early days of Clever when we were doing sales. Here he is on a broken chair, in a three by three call room.

在我的经验中,这看起来一点也不像神秘,也不像传说。这是我的联合创始人,丹和早期的聪明的日子,当我们做销售。他坐在一张破椅子上,在一个三三两两的休息室里。

I think he's eating a bagel, because he probably didn't have time for breakfast. That's what sales looks like, could not be further from the Don Draper imagery that a lot of people think of. So sales is you.

我想他在吃百吉饼,因为他可能没有时间吃早餐。这就是销售的样子,离很多人所想到的唐·德雷珀(DonDraper)的形象再远不过了。销售就是你。

And Y Combinator, I remember when we were going through the program, Paul Graham got up on the stage, and he said, "You should be spending every moment of every day doing one of two things, building a product, or talking to users." And talking to users, a big part of that can be selling. So this is a core responsibility of every startup founder, is not just building the product, but also talking to your users understanding their needs.

Y Combinator,我记得当我们进行这个项目的时候,Paul Graham站在舞台上,他说,“你应该每天花时间做两件事中的一件,一件事,一件产品,或者和用户交谈。”和用户交谈,其中很大一部分可能是销售。因此,这是每一位初创公司创始人的核心责任,不仅仅是构建产品,还包括与你的用户交流,让他们了解自己的需求。

And as you learn that is really a big part of what selling is. So this is a core responsibility for founders.

正如你所了解的那样,这真的是销售的一个很大的部分。所以这是创始人的核心责任。

A lot of founders think, "Well, I haven't done sales before." And that's true.

许多创始人认为,“我以前从来没有做过销售。”这是真的。

And they say, "Well, I'm not good at sales yet." And that could be true too. But one thing I've learned, is that as founders you also have some very unique advantages that can make you actually incredibly powerful at sales and very potent.

他们说,“嗯,我还不擅长销售。”这也可能是真的。但我学到的一件事是,作为创始人,你也有一些非常独特的优势,可以让你在销售上拥有难以置信的强大和强大的力量。

And the two advantages that I've noticed, one, is just your passion. You are more passionate about the product that you're building and selling than anyone in the world. Because otherwise, you probably wouldn't have irrationally quit your jobs and moved in with your parents, or whatever you've done to start this company. So one is your passion. That is so powerful in sales.

我注意到的两个好处,一是你的热情。你比世界上任何人都更热衷于你正在建造和销售的产品。否则,你可能不会不理智地辞掉工作,搬到父母那里,或者做些什么来创办这家公司。所以其中之一就是你的激情。这是如此强大的销售。

And the second thing you have is industry expertise. You know this problem better than anyone, you know why it needs to exist, you understand this problem more deeply, hopefully, than anyone.

你拥有的第二件事是行业专长。你比任何人都更了解这个问题,你知道为什么它需要存在,你比任何人都更深刻,更有希望地理解这个问题。

And so these two things, even if you've never done sales before, mean you can be incredibly effective.

因此,这两件事,即使你从来没有做过销售,意味着你可以非常有效。

And so don't think otherwise. Early on with Clever, one of the things we did that really worked for us was I had two co-founders. So there were three of us, and we just decided that one of us had to own sales.

所以别这么想。在早期,我们所做的事情之一就是我有两位联合创始人。所以我们有三个人,我们只是决定我们中的一个必须拥有自己的销售。

It was so important that we needed one person to be thinking about this every day.

这是如此重要,以至于我们每天都需要一个人来思考这个问题。

And so that ended up becoming me. My other two co-founders were focused on building the product and implementing the product and we decided this was important enough that I decided I was going to peel off and spend almost 100% of my time selling this product, starting from before it was even built. So from that point, from early enough on, think about who in your company is really owning this and it should probably be a founder and it should probably be as much of a full time job as you can spare. So now I want to talk about how sales actually works, and if you know anything about sales, Sales 101 is a lot of people talk about it like a funnel and there's different variations of this funnel.

最后变成了我。我的另外两位联合创始人专注于产品的开发和实现,我们认为这是非常重要的,所以我决定我将把我几乎100%的时间花在销售这个产品上,从它建成之前开始。因此,从那时起,从很早的时候,想想你的公司里谁真正拥有这个,它可能应该是一个创始人,这可能是尽可能多的全职工作,你可以节省。所以现在我想谈谈销售是如何运作的,如果你对销售有任何了解的话,销售101是很多人谈论它的一个漏斗,而且这个漏斗有不同的变化。

I have a really simple one that I put up here step one of the funnel is finding prospects, prospecting, these are leads who might even be interested in buying your product, who might even be interested in taking a call. From there you have conversations. Okay, so you figured out they're interested but you got to have a lot of conversations to figure out, "Is this the right product for them or not?" Third is closing. Okay, they actually want to buy the product. How do you not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and lose the deal, you have to go through a closing process.

我有一个非常简单的,我放在这里,第一步是寻找前景,勘探,这些线索,他们甚至可能有兴趣购买你的产品,谁可能有兴趣,甚至有兴趣接受电话。从那里你们就可以交谈了。好吧,所以你发现他们很感兴趣,但你需要进行大量的对话才能弄清楚,“这是他们的合适产品吗?”第三是关闭。好吧,他们真的想买这个产品。你怎么不从胜利的阴影中夺取失败而输掉这笔交易,你必须经历一个结束的过程。

And if you complete all of those things, then hopefully you're in the promised land.

如果你完成了所有这些事情,那么希望你已经到了应许之地。

And you have revenue, and you have your first sales.

你有收入,也有你的第一次销售。

And so this is how I think about the funnel. And what I'm going to do now is just walk you through each of these stages and share how I've approached these in my career and some tips that have worked for me along the way. So your mission in the first stage of prospecting is to figure out who will even take your call.

这就是我对漏斗的看法。我现在要做的就是带你走过每一个阶段,分享我在职业生涯中是如何处理这些问题的,以及一些对我有用的小窍门。因此,在勘探的第一阶段,你的任务就是找出谁会接你的电话。

And one of the things that for me was really helpful to understand is well, you're going to hear no a lot, you start talking about a new product to people and you're just going to hear a lot of nos. But one of the things that was really helpful for me to understand is you have this technology adoption curve. This was put out by a guy, Everett Rogers and the 60s.

对我来说,其中一件对我很有帮助的事情是,你不会听到太多,你会开始向人们谈论一个新产品,你只会听到很多。但是其中一件对我很有帮助的事情是,你有这个技术采用曲线。这是一个叫埃弗雷特·罗杰斯和60多岁的人提出的。

And it starts on the left, you have your innovators, and you have your early adopters of new technology, your early majority, your late majority, your laggards. These are terms that people in Silicon Valley throw around, that I've been hearing for years. But what I didn't know was that the inventor of this framework, this technology adoption lifecycle, Everett Rogers, he described it as a bell curve.

它从左边开始,你有你的创新者,你的早期采纳新技术的人,你早期的多数,你后期的多数,你的落后者。这些都是硅谷人随便说的,我已经听了好几年了。但我不知道的是,这个框架的发明者,这个采用技术的生命周期,埃弗雷特·罗杰斯(Everett Rogers),他把它描述成钟形曲线。

And he actually went through the effort of quantifying the area under the curve in each of these different segments.

实际上,他做了大量的工作来量化曲线下的面积,在每一个不同的部分。

And one of the things you notice is looking at this, the innovators segment is just 2.5% of the population. That means 2.5% of companies will even consider buying a product from a startup that is unproven, with no revenue.

你注意到的一件事就是看看这个,创新者部分只占人口的2.5%。这意味着2.5%的公司甚至会考虑从一家未经证实的初创企业那里购买产品,而没有收入。

And when you realize that to some founders, that's kind of depressing, wow, that's a very small percent of the market. But when I found this out, I actually found it massively motivating and massively invigorating. Because all of a sudden, it makes what you have to do really clear, you have to talk to a lot of people because you have to find that to 2.5%.

当你意识到对一些创始人来说,这是一种令人沮丧的,哇,这只是市场的一小部分。但当我发现这件事的时候,我发现它给人极大的激励和极大的鼓舞。因为突然之间,它让你必须做的事情变得很清楚,你必须和很多人交谈,因为你必须找到2.5%。

It's a numbers game, means you're going to have to reach out to at least 100 companies to find just two and a half on average, who are even potential buyers for your product. You're basically playing a version of, Where's Waldo, where you are looking for the very few companies who might be in this innovator segment.

这是一个数字游戏,意味着你必须联系至少100家公司,才能找到平均只有2.5家的公司,他们甚至是你产品的潜在买家。你基本上是在玩一个版本的“Waldo在哪里”,在这里你正在寻找极少数可能在这个创新领域的公司。

And so expect early on sales is not reaching out for 10 companies, reaching out and doing sales is a lot of grinding and it's a lot of effort in order to get the result you want. When it comes to actually starting these conversations, I found there's three things that worked for me. So in terms of finding those innovators, the first thing that has worked well for me is using my network. The second, which is a little surprising to people is conferences, and I'm going to talk about that.

因此,期望早期的销售不是对10家公司的接触,接触和做销售是很难的,为了得到你想要的结果而付出了很大的努力。说到真正开始这些对话,我发现有三件事对我有用。因此,在寻找那些创新者方面,首先对我起作用的是使用我的网络。第二个,让人有点惊讶的是会议,我将讨论这个问题。

And the third is cold emails. These are the three ways in which I find prospects.

第三个是冷冰冰的电子邮件。这是我发现前景的三种方式。

I'm not going to talk about my networks.

我不打算谈论我的网络。

I think most people understand that. But I can tell you many of the earliest deals I've done at every company I've been at, have been through people I've known, friends of friends. So do not underestimate your network, especially if you know the industry. You might think it's not very big, but you probably know a few people and those people might know a few people and so spend some time thinking about your network because you might find some really great sales opportunities that come through there, and those are the best. You don't need 100 people in your network to get to sales, you can usually deal with much fewer. But let's talk about conferences because I think conferences are the most underrated aspect of sales and one of the least understood aspects of sales. When I say conferences, a lot of people think I'm talking about this, CES or E3 and going to some place where there's 80,000 people, and it's basically more like a rock concert than anything else.

我想大多数人都明白这一点。但我可以告诉你,我在每一家公司做过的最早的交易,都是通过我认识的人,朋友的朋友做的。所以,不要低估你的网络,特别是如果你知道这个行业。你可能会认为这不是很大,但你可能认识一些人,这些人可能认识几个人,所以花点时间思考一下你的网络,因为你可能会找到一些非常好的销售机会,这些都是最好的。你不需要100人在你的网络中获得销售,你通常可以处理更少的。但是让我们谈谈会议,因为我认为会议是销售中最被低估的方面,也是最不被理解的销售方面之一。当我说会议的时候,很多人认为我在谈论这个,CES或者E3,去一个有8万人的地方,这基本上更像是一场摇滚音乐会。

And when I say conferences, I'm talking about something very different. Usually they look like this. Usually it's a bunch of executives or people in a hotel room, cooped up for a couple days, oftentimes, you know, in places like Milwaukee or Kansas.

当我说会议的时候,我说的是完全不同的东西。一般都是这样的。通常是一群高管或者是住在酒店房间里的人,经常被关在密尔沃基或堪萨斯州这样的地方。

And let me tell you, this is such a powerful way, these conferences are such a powerful way to meet your users. You have to go where users are.

让我告诉你,这是一个如此强大的方式,这些会议是如此强大的方式,以满足您的用户。你必须去用户所在的地方。

And many times if you're selling to a business or to a corporate buyer, this is where users are, they go to conferences, they're there with their peers, they're learning.

很多时候,如果你卖给企业或公司买家,这就是用户所在的地方,他们去参加会议,和他们的同龄人在一起,他们在学习。

And that's where you should be to. Now, let me say a few words about how I've approached conferences in the past. Because this really is where so many of Clever's initial partnerships and customers came from. One, figure out what are the big industry conferences for your product and your startup. Usually, there's not just one, usually there's like 10, and you have to work to figure out what they are.

那就是你该去的地方。现在,让我谈谈我过去是如何对待会议的。因为这正是许多聪明公司最初的合作伙伴和客户的来源。首先,找出为你的产品和你的创业公司举办的大型行业会议。通常情况下,不只是一个,通常是10,你必须努力找出它们是什么。

Ask people in the industry, "What conferences do you go to? Which ones are on your radar?" But there's usually quite a few and definitely more than one. Two, pick a few that you're going to attend, buy a ticket, sometimes they're expensive, thousands of dollars, sometimes you don't even need a ticket, it depends on the event. But figure out the conference and decide you're going to go hopefully weeks or months in advance. Three, get the list. This is such an important part of making conferences like this worthwhile. Find a way to know who's going to be there, write to the organizers, write to sponsors, maybe it's on the website. But figure out who's going to be there in advance. Don't just show up at a conference and think you're going to network your way and meet everybody.

问这个行业的人,“你参加什么会议?哪些会议在你的雷达上?”但通常有很多,而且肯定不止一个。第二,挑选一些你要参加的,买一张票,有时很贵,几千美元,有时你甚至不需要票,这取决于活动。但要想清楚会议的内容,并决定提前几周或几个月才能完成任务。三,拿到名单。这是如此重要的一部分,使这样的会议是值得的。想办法知道谁会在那里,写信给组织者,写信给赞助商,也许会出现在网站上。但先弄清楚谁会去。不要只是出现在一个会议上,并认为你将以你的方式建立网络,与每个人见面。

Although if you can pull that off, by all means, do it.

不过,如果你能做到这一点,那就去做吧。

It's just not something that everyone can do. But when you have the list of who's going to be there, then you can email people in advance, and say, "Hey, I'm going to be at this event, I noticed you are too, I'm working on this thing.

这不是每个人都能做的。但是当你有了名单,然后你可以事先发电子邮件给人们,然后说,“嘿,我要参加这个活动,我注意到你也在,我正在做这件事。

I'd love to show it to you. Can we find some time to chat?" And don't just do it with a few people, do it with as many potential buyers or prospects as you can. My goal when I go to a conference or when anyone from Clever goes to a conference is that we have our entire days booked up in 30 minute increments. Because we've done so much effort in advance of the conferences, trying to line everything up getting these meetings and they end up becoming the most productive day of the year when we actually go, and we actually get to have all of these conversations and have all of these buyers and I get to the end of a night, even the first night at a conference, when I yeah, just been doing one day ...

我很想给你看。我们能找点时间聊聊吗?“不要只和几个人一起做,要尽可能多的潜在买家或潜在客户。当我去参加一个会议或者任何一个聪明的人去参加一个会议的时候,我的目标是,我们的整个日子都是在30分钟的增量中被安排好的。因为我们在会议之前已经做了很多的努力,试图把所有的事情都排在一起,使这些会议成为一年中最有成效的一天,当我们真的去的时候,我们实际上有了所有这些谈话,让所有这些买家和我在一个晚上结束,甚至是在第一个晚上。会议,当我是的时候,只是做了一天.

And let me tell you every time I am exhausted, and I am also so energized because there's nothing that's more fun than meeting with customers and meeting with potential buyers and hearing their reactions to what you're building. So I cannot emphasize enough how important conferences have been in every company I've worked in sales at, and I highly recommend you explore this. So that's conferences. The other and frankly the probably more common approach is cold emails. People don't really cold call too much anymore. Maybe you can make it work, but cold emails I mean, I still do that today.

每次我筋疲力尽的时候,我都要告诉你,我也是如此的精力充沛,因为没有什么比与客户见面、与潜在买家见面、倾听他们对你所建筑的反应更有趣的了。因此,我无论怎样强调我在销售部门工作过的每一家公司都有多么重要的会议,我强烈建议您探索这一点。那就是会议了。另一种-坦率地说-可能更常见的方法是发送冷冰冰的电子邮件。人们不会再打太多冷门了。也许你可以让它发挥作用,但我的意思是,我今天仍然这么做。

And a lot of people don't know how to write cold emails, they don't know how to reach out to someone in a productive way.

很多人不知道如何写冷冰冰的电子邮件,他们不知道如何以一种高效的方式接触到某人。

I know this because I'm on the receiving end of so many bad cold emails, we probably all are. They're really long, they're not personalized, they're not actionable, they're boring, they're irrelevant. So don't do that. But if you don't do that, well, then what do you do? How do you have a cold email strategy that's effective? In the early days of Clever, in the early days of other startups, we would sit down and we'd send, 10, 30, 50 emails to cold prospects.

我之所以知道这一点,是因为我收到了很多冷冰冰的电子邮件,我们可能都收到了。它们真的很长,它们不是个性化的,它们是不可采取行动的,它们是无聊的,它们是不相关的。所以别那么做。但如果你不这么做,那你会怎么做?你如何有一个有效的冷电子邮件策略?在聪明的早期,在其他初创公司的早期,我们会坐下来,给前景暗淡的人发送10,30,50封电子邮件。

And it would look something like this.

看起来就像这样。

And I actually found an old email and I put it up here so you guys can see it, you feel free to copy it, but it is the simplest thing in the world. You'll notice it's short.

我发现了一封旧邮件,我把它放在这里,这样你们就可以看到它,你可以随意复制它,但它是世界上最简单的东西。你会发现它很短。

It's to the point it's personalized.

完全是个性化的。

It's actionable, "Hey, my name is Tyler.

这是可诉的,“嘿,我叫泰勒。

And I'm the CEO of Clever this is what we do.

我是聪明公司的首席执行官,这就是我们要做的。

I thought this might be relevant for you because of XYZ reason that's personal to you. Even if you're not in the market, I'd love to chat with you about this, which is true. Do you have some time this week or later this week? I'm free I'm free now or I'm free at this time." Super simple, this will probably get read as opposed to some of the paragraph long diatribes about why my product is the best and why you're crazy for not using it and before we even met. All you're trying to do is get a call with somebody and actually meet them. And so we'll send out cold emails.

我认为这可能与您相关,因为XYZ的原因是对您个人而言。即使你不在市场,我也想和你谈谈,这是真的。这个星期你有时间吗?这个星期晚些时候有时间吗?我是自由的-我现在自由了,或者现在我自由了。“非常简单,这可能会被读到,而不是一些关于为什么我的产品是最好的,为什么你疯狂地不使用它,甚至在我们见面之前就被读到了。你想要做的只是接到一个电话,然后和他们真正的见面。所以我们会发一封冷冰冰的电子邮件。”

It's very effective, but make sure you do it right. Make sure you're writing emails that are interesting to people, that aren't too salesy, that are personalized and that are genuine.

这是非常有效的,但要确保你做得对。确保你写的电子邮件是人们感兴趣的,不是太推销,是个性化的,是真实的。

And remember, all you're trying to do is get a conversation, get out of that prospecting phase and into stage two, which is conversations. So let's talk about stage to stage two. Okay, you've gone to conferences, you've done cold emails, you've worked your network and now you're talking to prospects. This is exciting. People want to talk to you. They might want to buy your product. This is what you've been waiting for. When this happens, and you get them on the phone, remember to shut up and listen.

记住,你所要做的就是进行一次对话,走出勘探阶段,进入第二阶段,也就是对话。让我们来谈谈第二阶段。好吧,你参加过会议,发过冷冰冰的电子邮件,你用过你的网络,现在你在和潜在的人交谈。这太令人兴奋了。人们都想和你谈谈。他们可能想买你的产品。这就是你一直在等待的。当这种情况发生的时候,当你让他们打电话的时候,记得闭嘴,听我说。

And when people ask me, "What's your number one sales tip?" When new sales people say, "What's the number one thing I should practice or work on?" If you take nothing else from this presentation, take this. Sales is about listening.

当人们问我,“你的第一销售建议是什么?”当新的销售人员问:“我应该练习或工作的第一件事情是什么?”如果你没有从这个报告中拿出任何其他的东西,那么就拿着这个。销售就是倾听。

I've had the opportunity in my life to shadow some of who I think are some of the best sales people in the world, incredibly successful salespeople.

我有机会在我的生活中,一些我认为是世界上最好的销售人员,难以置信的成功的销售人员的影子。

And they look nothing like the picture I showed you on the first slide. They were soft spoken and what I remember specifically was that they were world class listeners.

看上去一点也不像我在第一张幻灯片上给你看的照片。他们说话柔和,我特别记得的是,他们是世界级的听众。

And the reason that's so important is because that's what sales is at its core. People think sales is about just being a battering ram and just hitting or getting your points across, and repeating them over and over until somebody finally breaks down and buys your product.

之所以如此重要,是因为这就是销售的核心所在。人们认为,销售只是一个沉重的打击,只是击中或让你的观点,并重复了一遍又一遍,直到有人最终崩溃和购买你的产品。

And let me tell you, that doesn't work.

让我告诉你,这不管用。

And what does work is building relationships with people understanding their problems, understanding what their needs are, and then seeing if you can help them with your solution.

而真正起作用的是与人们建立关系,了解他们的问题,了解他们的需求,然后看看你是否能帮助他们解决问题。

And in order to make that happen, you have to listen. So most founders when I ...

为了实现这一点,你必须倾听。所以大多数创始人当我.。

I've shattered a lot of sales calls and one thing I see very frequently as a founder, they're so excited. They finally got someone on the phone, they're hooked. They're definitely going to be the first customer and they get them on the phone and they just talk. And it's understandable, right? You're excited, you're excited about your product, you're passionate about it, you can't wait to show off every bell and whistle that you've spent months thoughtfully building. But it will totally kill your sales deal. What you'll naturally do is talk for 70% of the time on the first call, and maybe leave 30% of space for the other person. The best sales people in the world, when I've seen them in action, it's the opposite. They're listening 70% of the time.

我打破了很多销售电话,有一件事我经常看到,作为一个创始人,他们是如此兴奋。他们终于找了个人打电话,他们迷上了。他们肯定会成为第一位顾客,他们通过电话和他们交谈。这是可以理解的,对吧?你很兴奋,你对你的产品很兴奋,你对它很有热情,你迫不及待地要炫耀每一个钟声和哨子,这是你花了几个月深思熟虑建立起来的。但这会毁了你的销售协议。你自然要做的就是在第一次打电话的时候用70%的时间说话,也许给对方留出30%的空间。世界上最好的销售人员,当我看到他们在行动时,情况正好相反。他们70%的时间都在听。

And they're asking questions like, "Hey, tell me about the problem you're having. How do you solve it today? Why did you even agree to take my call? What would your ideal solution look like if you could have anything?" They're asking questions because they care, and they want to understand and they want to figure out how to help this person solve their problem, and yes, their product might be part of that solution, but it involves deep listening. One trick I can share on this, is at Clever we use a tool called UberConference.

他们会问这样的问题:“嘿,告诉我你遇到的问题。你今天是怎么解决的?你为什么同意接我的电话?如果你有什么东西,你的理想解决方案会是什么样子?”他们问题是因为他们关心,他们想要理解,他们想知道如何帮助这个人解决他们的问题,是的,他们的产品可能是解决方案的一部分,但这需要深入倾听。我可以分享的一个技巧是,聪明的我们使用了一个叫做UberConference的工具。

And UberConference is great. But one of the things I love about it, is that the end of each call, it sends you an email, and it tells you how much time you spent talking versus how much time the other person spent talking.

UberConference很棒。但我最喜欢的一点是,每次通话结束后,它都会给你发一封电子邮件,告诉你花了多少时间和对方交谈了多少时间。

And it's funny because I can look at these and it's a running joke. I'll look at these and sometimes you'll talk to someone and say, "I just got off a call.

这很有趣,因为我可以看这些,这是一个持续的笑话。我会看这些,有时你会跟别人说,“我刚接到一个电话。

It was great.

太棒了。

I nailed it, they're going to definitely buy." And then I'll look at the UberConference call email at the end. Then if it looks like that, I'll say, "I don't think that call went as well as you think." I don't know if we're really ready to make that sale quite yet.

我搞定了,他们肯定会买的。“然后我会看最后的UberConference Call Email。如果是这样的话,我会说,”我不认为那个电话打得像你想的那么好。“我不知道我们是否真的准备好出售了。”

And so the number one thing that I hope to impress on you today is sales is about listening.

所以,我希望今天给你们留下深刻印象的第一件事是销售是关于倾听的。

And it's not just about a hacker asking the right questions, it's about genuinely listening.

这不仅仅是一个黑客提出正确的问题,而是真正地倾听。

And if you can do that, the rest is easy.

如果你能做到,剩下的就很容易了。

It really is. So you've spent all this time prospecting, now you've had your phone calls, you've done a good job listening.

真的是。所以你花了这么长时间去探矿,现在你接到了你的电话,你的收听工作做得很好。

And then another thing to know about sales, is there's a lot of steps to the process. Up here, I have a lot of different steps that you might go through in a sales process, calls, emails, pricing calls, sending references, talking with different executives, there are a lot of steps to sales.

另外一件关于销售的事情是,这个过程有很多步骤。在这里,我有很多不同的步骤,你可能会在销售过程中经历,电话,电子邮件,定价电话,发送推荐信,和不同的主管交谈,销售有很多步骤。

And up here, these aren't just hypothetical steps. What I've put up here are actually all of the steps from one of my very first deals at Clever. This is one deal, and frankly some of the stuff is kind of embarrassing, right? Like met the person, they were interested, I emailed, no response.

在这里,这些不只是假设的步骤。我在这里展示的实际上是我在“聪明”公司的第一笔交易中的所有步骤。这是一笔交易,坦白地说,有些事情有点尴尬,对吧?就像遇到了那个人,他们都很感兴趣,我发了邮件,没有回应。

I emailed them again, no response.

我又给他们发了邮件,没有回复。

I emailed them again, they responded. Scheduled a call, email, no response.

我又给他们发了邮件,他们回复了。安排了一个电话,电子邮件,没有回复。

I mean, this is straight up embarrassing.

我是说,这真是太尴尬了。

And this is from someone who wanted to buy our product.

这是一个想买我们产品的人。

Isn't that crazy? So one of the things I hope to impress on you is, it is a lot of work to do sales well, and it takes a lot of follow up, and you kind of have to have this inhumane willingness to just keep going and push through. This whole lifecycle probably took about two months, it ended up. We ended up closing $100,000 a year customer, but this is what it took.

这不是很疯狂吗?所以我希望给你们留下深刻印象的一点是,做好销售工作需要大量的工作,这需要大量的跟进,而且你必须有这种不人道的意愿,才能继续坚持下去。整个生命周期大概要花两个月的时间,最后才结束。最后,我们以每年100,000美元的客户收购价,但这就是我们付出的代价。

And I talked to a lot of founders who maybe they have a good meeting, they do a follow up email, and they don't get a response.

我和很多创始人谈过,他们可能有一个很好的会议,他们做了一封后续邮件,但他们没有得到回应。

And they're like, "Oh, well, maybe they weren't interested after all. Maybe it's not a good fit." And they disqualify themselves. Well, just remember, this is what a success case looks like, at least if you're doing enterprise sales.

他们说,“哦,好吧,也许他们根本不感兴趣。也许这不太合身。”他们取消了自己的资格。好吧,记住,这是一个成功的案例,至少如果你在做企业销售的话。

And it's not over till it's over.

直到一切结束。

And it's not over till they say no. But sometimes you do have to remind them, "Hey, I'm still here. Hey, are you still interested?" Because probably your buyers have a lot on their mind, that's not you or your startup.

直到他们拒绝才会结束。但有时你必须提醒他们,“嘿,我还在这里。嘿,你还感兴趣吗?”因为你的买家可能有很多心事,那不是你或你的创业公司。

And probably they have a lot of other things going on in their life.

也许他们的生活中还有很多其他的事情在发生。

And so being persistent isn't rude, being persistent can be helpful, if you do it in the right way, and you're respectful. Now, I will say one thing here. Follow up is really good and really important. But what's also really good, sometimes you get a no.

所以持之以恒并不是粗鲁的行为,持之以恒是有帮助的,如果你这样做是正确的,而且你是尊重的。现在,我要说一件事。跟进是非常好的,也是非常重要的。但也很好的是,有时你会被拒绝。

And getting those nos can also be really good and really helpful. Because when you're a small start up founder, small founding team, you've got to figure out where to spend your time and energy and you can't have a pipeline of hundreds and hundreds of deals going at one time. You just can't, you won't be able to do it.

得到这些数字也是很好的,也是很有帮助的。因为当你是一个小创办人,一个小型的创始团队,你必须弄清楚在哪里花费你的时间和精力,你不可能一次有一条数以百计的交易管道。你就是不能,你做不到。

And so there's actually a lot of value. My friend Steve Garrity taught me this. There's a lot of value to driving conversations to a yes or no quickly. Because nos, you can move on and start filling the pipeline with other people that could become yeses. So I would encourage you to have relentless follow up, be determined. Don't let things drop but at the same time if you get a no, see it as a blessing in disguise because you can move on to the next deal that could be a yes. Okay, so you've prospected, you've had these great conversations with customers, you've made it through the rigmarole, you've gone through all these steps. Now let's talk about closing. This is an area that is weird, it's foreign. So you have to figure out how to close a contract with a customer who's told you they want to buy, it's harder than it sounds. A lot of deals get messed up in here. So let me just walk you through a few things I've learned. One, assuming you're doing an enterprise contract, you'll need an agreement, and then you'll send it over to the company, and they want to change the agreement.

所以实际上有很大的价值。我的朋友史蒂夫·加里蒂教我的。让谈话迅速变成“是”或“否”是很有价值的。因为NOS,您可以继续前进,开始用其他可能成为YES的人来填充管道。所以我鼓励你坚持不懈地跟进,下决心。不要让事情顺其自然,但同时,如果你得到了否定,把它看作是一种伪装的祝福,因为你可以继续下一笔交易,这可能是肯定的。好吧,你已经展望过了,你和客户进行了很好的对话,你通过了繁琐的程序,你经历了所有这些步骤。现在让我们来谈谈关闭。这是一个奇怪的地方,是外国的。所以你必须想办法和一个告诉你他们想买的客户签订合同,这比听起来更难。很多交易在这里都搞砸了。所以让我告诉你一些我学到的东西。第一,假设你正在做一个企业合同,你需要一个协议,然后你会把它交给公司,他们想改变协议。

It's a process called redlining.

这是一个叫红线的过程。

And then their lawyers will send it back to you, and you might look at it or your lawyers might look at it, you might have more changes and you go back and forth in this redlining process. So the first step is you need to have an agreement to propose.

然后他们的律师会把它发回给你,你可能会看它,或者你的律师会看它,你可能会有更多的变化,你会在这个红线的过程中来回地重复。所以第一步是你需要有一个协议来提议。

And by the way, they're going to expect it from you. When they're interested, they're going to say, "Send me an agreement." And make sure that you have something or you've been working on something so that it's not like, "Oh, I'll get back to you in a month." If you don't have something, I've good news which is if you're not aware, YC has an open source sales template, posted on their website, and I worked on this with James Reilly at Goodwin Procter and some other folks including the Y Combinator legal team and YC decided to open source this. So any of you can use it. Obviously you'll probably need to customize it for your needs, and at some point, you'll want to get counsel, but as a basic starting point, there is a free template that you can use for sales in Y Combinator's website.

顺便说一句,他们会从你那里得到的。当他们感兴趣的时候,他们会说,“给我一个协议。”确保你有一些东西,或者你一直在做一些事情,这样就不会像“哦,我会在一个月后给你回电话。”如果你没有什么,我有一个好消息,如果你不知道,YC有一个开源的销售模板,张贴在他们的网站上,我和Goodwin Procter的James Reilly和其他一些人,包括Y Combinator法律团队和YC决定开放源代码。所以你们中的任何人都可以使用它。显然,您可能需要定制它以满足您的需求,并且在某一时刻,您会希望得到建议,但作为一个基本的起点,有一个免费的模板,您可以使用在Y Combinator的网站上销售。

And then once you're going into this back and forth, I'll never forget it.

一旦你来来回回,我永远不会忘记它。

I have seen some founders let this process drag out for months fighting over the dumbest things. When you are at an early stage startup, when you are trying to get your first customers, early customers are like manna from heaven.

我见过一些创始人让这一过程拖了好几个月,为最愚蠢的事情而争吵。当你处于创业初期,当你试图获得你的第一批客户时,早期的客户就像天堂一般。

And if you don't get them, you're not going to go very far, you're done.

如果你不明白,你就不会走得太远,你就完蛋了。

And yet, I have seen startups in the early phase because they think that what they're supposed to do or someone gave them bad advice, quibble over the dumbest things. So my advice for you is when you get to this step, especially for your first early customers, they're gonna want to put weird things in the contract with indemnity clauses and warranty clauses and get it reviewed by a lawyer, don't sign anything dumb. But your goal is to finish and move on and just keep that in mind.

然而,我在早期阶段就看到过初创公司,因为他们认为自己应该做什么,或者有人给了他们糟糕的建议,为最愚蠢的事情争吵不休。所以我给你的建议是,当你走到这一步的时候,特别是对于你的第一批早期客户,他们会想在合同中加入一些奇怪的东西,包括赔偿条款和保证条款,然后让律师对其进行审查,不要在任何愚蠢的事情上签字。但你的目标是完成并继续前进,记住这一点。

And if you're going through four or five, six revision processes, you're doing something wrong. So figure out how to move this quickly and don't quibble over small things. Get the first customers because that's what you need to keep going. Okay, another closing trap. You got the customer interested, they want to buy, things look great.

如果你经历了四五个,六个修订过程,你做错了什么。所以要想办法快速移动,不要在小事上唠叨。找到第一批顾客,因为这就是你需要继续下去的地方。好吧,再来个圈套。你让顾客感兴趣,他们想买东西,看上去不错。

And they come to you and they say, "Hey, actually, I want to buy but only if you had this one other feature, would I buy." It sounds so promising. You're so close. They just want one more thing, so you can build that thing.

他们来找你,他们说,“嘿,实际上,我想买,但只有当你有另外一个功能,我会买。”听起来很有希望。你离我太近了。他们只想再要一件东西,这样你就可以建造它了。

It wouldn't be that hard. Unfortunately, once you start hearing this, in my experience, unfortunately, it is more often a pass than anything else.

不会那么难的。不幸的是,一旦你开始听到这一点,在我的经验中,不幸的是,它比其他任何东西都更多的是一个通行证。

And the thing to remember is unfortunately, building that one thing when someone says, "Oh, I would buy it, except it's just missing that one thing." If you built it, there'd probably be another thing after that, and another thing after that.

不幸的是,当有人说,“哦,我会买下它,只是它错过了一件东西。”如果你建造了它,在那之后可能会有另一件事,以及在那之后的另一件事。

And you don't want to be in a world where you're building lots of one off things for customers. Now your first customer, second customer, do what it takes folks. But very quickly, you get in a world where you start hearing this and you realize it's not a good thing.

你不想在这样的世界里为顾客制造很多东西。现在你的第一个客户,第二个客户,做它所需要的人们。但是很快,你就进入了一个你开始听到这个声音的世界,你意识到这不是一件好事。

And so two ways I've seen of solving this, one is, well, if you really want the sale and you really want to hold them to their word and have that commitment, say, "Okay, well, I'll build it if you agree to buy the product." Which means I can't demo it for you today, I can't show you reference customers on this thing you want, but I will build it for you if you sign up and if you've spent the time listening and building the relationship and they trust you, that can work.The other thing is you say, "Look, we're going to build what customers need, and we're going to wait till we hear from more customers." And oftentimes I find even in that case, if they still want the product they'll buy it even without that one feature and hopefully end up building what they need anyways. But at least then you're not building something for just one customer. Third closing trap, free trials, you get so close to someone, they're so interested, they're your perfect first customer.

所以我看到了解决这个问题的两种方法,一种是,如果你真的想要销售,你真的想信守他们的承诺,然后说,“好吧,如果你同意购买这个产品,我会建造它。”这意味着我今天不能为你演示它,我不能向你展示你想要的东西,但是如果你注册了,如果你花了时间倾听和建立这种关系,并且他们信任你,那就可以。另一件事是,你说,“听着,我们要建立客户需要的东西,我们会等到更多的客户来接电话。”而且我经常发现,即使在这种情况下,如果他们仍然想要的产品,他们会购买它,即使没有这一功能,并希望最终建立他们需要的东西。但至少你不是在为一个客户建造东西。第三个关闭陷阱,免费试用,你接近某人,他们如此感兴趣,他们是你完美的第一客户。

And then they say, "Yeah, we just like to try it for 60 days. Folks when you are starting your company and when you are out there trying to make your startup work, you need things like commitment, you need validation, you need revenue, and guess what? A free trial doesn't get you any of those things.

然后他们说:“是的,我们只是想试一试60天。当你刚开始创业的时候,当你想让你的创业成功的时候,你需要的是承诺,你需要确认,你需要收入,你猜怎么着?免费试用并不能给你带来任何东西。

And so at every company I've been at, I've never worked at a company where they did free trials. We just said we can't do it. We're spending a lot of time out here trying to find the right customers for our product, just spending a lot of time building the right product, we're not going to give it away for free on the hopes that maybe you'll decide you want it. But we flipped it around and said, "But we want to be reasonable.

所以在我工作过的每一家公司,我从来没有在一家他们做免费试验的公司工作过。我们只是说我们做不到。我们花了很多时间在这里试图为我们的产品找到合适的客户,只是花了大量的时间来制造正确的产品,我们不会因为希望你会决定你想要它而免费赠送它。但我们把它翻过来说,“但我们想要讲理。

And we know you're taking a chance on us, there's risk. So we only do annual agreements here. That's how we operate. But if for any reason you're not satisfied, in the first 30 days, you can opt out of the agreement, and there won't be any penalty, you can cancel." And having it that way, where the default is they're a customer, but if something goes wrong, they're still protected, actually it's kind of both parties meeting in the middle and it solves for their concern that they're taking a risk on someone new, while solving for your concern, which is that you need commitment and validation to keep going. And way better to be in a case where they default is that they're a customer than the default is, well, you need to renegotiate something in 60 days from now and you're right back where you started. So to the extent you can avoid the free trial trap. So that's closing. So now you know how I've approached prospecting, how I approached the conversations, how I've approached closing, happy to answer questions on these when we break, but just end on some final parting thoughts. What I've described here is the enterprise sales process I've used going from zero to 1,000,000. First million in revenue, this is the exact process we've used multiple times and it's worked. But not every company, every company is different.

我们知道你在冒险,这是有风险的。所以我们只在这里签订年度协议。我们就是这样运作的。但是,如果出于任何原因你不满意,在头30天,你可以选择退出协议,不会有任何处罚,你可以取消。“这样做,默认情况下,他们是客户,但如果出了问题,他们仍然受到保护,实际上,这是一种双方在中间开会的方式,它解决了他们对新来的人承担风险的担忧,同时解决了你的担忧,那就是你需要承诺和确认才能继续下去。在他们违约的情况下,最好是他们是客户,而不是默认的,嗯,从现在开始,你需要在60天内重新谈判一些事情,然后你就回到了你开始的地方。所以在一定程度上你可以避免免费的审判陷阱。那就快结束了。所以现在你知道我是如何接近探矿的,我是如何接近谈话的,我是如何接近结束的,很高兴在我们分手的时候回答关于这些的问题,但只是结束一些最后的离别的想法。我在这里描述的是我所使用的从零到100万的企业销售过程。第一,百万美元的收入,这是我们多次使用的确切流程,而且成功了。但并不是每一家公司,每一家公司都是不同的。

And one of the things that I love to encourage founders to think about early is what kind of company and specifically what kind of sales motion are you going to have in the long term? Kristof [Jents] who's a VC, has this really incredible blog post.

我喜欢鼓励创始人尽早思考的事情之一是,从长远来看,你会有什么样的公司,特别是什么样的销售动议?Kristof[Jents]是一个风投公司,他有一篇非常令人难以置信的博客文章。

I just love how memorable it is. But he says, "There's five ways to build 100 million dollar business from a sales perspective.

我只是喜欢它是多么令人难忘。但他说,“从销售角度看,有五种方法可以建立1亿美元的业务。

If your average customer pays you $100,000, well then you just need to find 1000 customers and you're done. Or if your average customer pays you $10,000, then you need to find 10,000 customers and you're done. Or on the far end, and so those are your elephants and your deer, on your far end, you have these flies and they only pay you $10, but you need 10,000,000 of them." And so it helps to think about it as you're starting to think about your sales motion, "Well, how much are my customers paying, and therefore how many of them am I going to need to have and what sort of sales motion is going to be sustainable for my business?" Because the way you're selling your product today, is you're flying to people, you're meeting them at conferences, you're doing everything.

如果你的普通客户付给你10万美元,那么你只需要找到1000个客户,你就完蛋了。或者,如果你的普通客户付给你10,000美元,那么你需要找到10,000名客户,你就完蛋了。或者在远处,这些是你的大象和你的鹿,在你的另一头,你有这些苍蝇,他们只付给你10美元,但你需要10,000,000。“因此,当你开始考虑你的销售动议时,考虑一下这一点是有帮助的:“好吧,我的客户要付多少钱?因此,我需要有多少客户?什么样的销售动议对我的业务来说是可持续的?”因为你今天推销你的产品的方式,就是你要飞向人们,你要在会议上和他们见面,你要做所有的事情。

I described this very kind of high touch high energy sales process, but your customers are only paying you $10 a year, or $100 a year or $1,000 a year and you're going to have to repeat that 10 million times.

我描述了这种高触觉的高能量销售过程,但是你的客户每年只付你10美元,或者每年100美元,或者每年1000美元,你必须重复这1000万次。

It's impossible.

不可能的。

It's impossible and it's way too expensive for you to build your business that way. On the other hand, if you are successful in building a low touch sales model where you're able to do things, scalably, maybe you're selling to small businesses, of which there's millions, maybe you have some way that people doing self service and sign up, well, then you can be over on the right side of this graph.

这是不可能的,而且这样做对你来说太贵了。另一方面,如果你成功地建立了一个低触控销售模式,你可以做一些事情,可以规模地,也许你是卖给小企业,其中有数百万,也许你有一些方式,人们做自助服务和注册,好吧,那么你就可以在这个图表的右边了。

And you can have a lower price product. But the price of your product and your sales motion are inextricably connected.

你也可以买到更便宜的产品。但是,你的产品的价格和你的销售动议是不可分割地联系在一起的。

And that's something that took me a little while to understand, but I thought this graph really helps make clear, is depending on how much are you able to charge for your product, and depending on how much people are willing to pay for your product, that'll change how you approach sales as you're building your company and building your sales team. So those are some lessons I've learned along the way doing sales.

这是我花了一段时间才理解的,但我认为这张图表确实有助于明确,取决于你能为你的产品收取多少费用,取决于多少人愿意为你的产品付费,这将改变你在建立公司和建立销售团队时对待销售的方式。这些是我在销售过程中学到的一些经验。

I wanted to end and just say good luck out there. You guys are figuring this out.

我想结束,只想在外面祝你好运。你们正在想办法。

It's the most fun time of your company, you get to have these really energizing conversations with tons of users and figure out if they're potential buyers and good luck, because you'll always look back on this as one of the most fun parts of your journey. So thanks for having me.

这是你公司最有趣的时刻,你可以和无数的用户进行充满活力的交谈,找出他们是否是潜在的买家和好运,因为你会一直把这看作是你旅途中最有趣的部分之一。谢谢你邀请我。

And I think we have some time for Q&A. Yeah, why don't we start here.

我想我们还有时间问询。嗯,我们为什么不从这里开始呢?

Speaker 3: Yeah, thank you very much for the talk. Quick question you mentioned about follow ups and so forth. What would be the appropriate time between emails and just so you don't seem overbearing and how long do you think it would take for a typical follow up?

演讲者3:是的,非常感谢您的演讲。你提到的关于后续行动的快速问题等等。什么时候才是电子邮件之间的合适时间,这样你就不会显得专横了,你认为需要多长时间才能进行一次典型的后续行动?

Tyler Bosmeny: I'd say on average maybe a little under a week. So if you email someone, they don't get back to you, I think it's polite and not over eager to nudge five, six, seven days later. Yeah. Over here.

泰勒·博斯梅尼:我想说,平均来说,可能还不到一周。所以,如果你给某人发电子邮件,他们就不会回复你,我认为这是礼貌的,而且不急于在五、六、七天后再推。嗯在这边。

Speaker 4: Hi. My name is [Shreys] , I'm the co-founder of [inaudible] .

演讲者4:嗨。我的名字是[史莱伊斯],我是[听不到的]的创始人之一。

And I always had this sales thing at one point throughout your process did you feel like you were pestering the customers? Because you can't ... You put it a nice way, "Oh you got to keep on going. You got to keep on asking, you got to keep on sending them." Along the process, did you ever feel like you were pestering your customers or not?

在你的整个过程中,我一直都有这样的销售经历,你是否觉得你在纠缠客户?因为你不能.。你用一种很好的方式说,“哦,你要继续前进。你要不停地问,你要继续发送。”在这个过程中,你有没有感觉到你在纠缠你的客户?

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, so the question was, do you ever feel like you're pestering your customers when you send them follow up emails? I like to think that if they haven't told, then you're within your rights to follow up, a reasonable number of times.

泰勒:是的,所以问题是,当你向客户发送后续邮件时,你会不会觉得自己在缠着他们?我认为如果他们没有告诉你,那么你就有权利跟进,合理的次数。

If you're talking about emailing someone eight times and they haven't gotten back to you, I mean take a hint, right? But I think if they haven't told you know and especially if you had an earlier conversation where they were interested, assume the best, assume they're busy, assume that they've got other things going on. You might not be their top priority. But there's nothing wrong, especially if you're doing it on a weekly cadence or something like that.

如果你说给某人发了八次邮件,但他们还没有回复你,我的意思是接受暗示,对吧?但我认为,如果他们没有告诉你,尤其是如果你之前有一个他们感兴趣的谈话,假设最好的,假设他们很忙,假设他们有其他事情正在进行。你可能不是他们的重中之重。但是没有什么不对的,特别是如果你是在每周的节奏或类似的情况下做的话。

And your emails are thoughtful and personalized.

你的电子邮件很贴心也很个性化。

I have never once in my life been annoyed by somebody sending respectful follow ups, as long as they seem thoughtful and personalized. Don't forget that part.

在我的生活中,我从来没有被别人送出恭敬的跟进令我生气,只要他们看起来是体贴的和个性化的。别忘了那部分。

If it's just like I'm getting mail merged every week with another template.

如果就像我每周都要把邮件和另一个模板合并。

I mean, nobody likes that person. Yeah, over here.

我是说没人喜欢那个人。是的,在这边。

Speaker 5: Hey Tyler.

演讲者5:嘿,泰勒。

Any thoughts on early on when you're trying to get [inaudible] ?

当你试图得到[听不见]的时候,你有什么想法吗?

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, I would say you don't learn about product market fit from ... Oh, sorry. The question was, when you're getting these nose in early sales conversations, how do you know it when they're just not an early adopter and how do you know when you should be reading signs of product market fit or lack thereof? And my answer to that is, I don't think you discover product market fit from the nos, I think you only discover it from the yeses. So I think when you get nos, there's a lot of reasons people could be giving you nos.

泰勒·博斯梅尼:是的,我想说你并不是从.啊!对不起问题是,当你在早期的销售谈话中发现这些问题时,你怎么知道它们不是一个早期的采用者,你如何知道什么时候你应该阅读产品市场适合或不合适的迹象呢?我对此的回答是,我不认为你是从空头支票中发现产品市场的,我认为你只是从赞成的人那里发现的。所以我认为,当你得到了,有很多原因,人们可能会给你不。

And I wouldn't even necessarily believe the reasons that people give nos. Because in the same way that you can't trust when VCs give you no, the reasons is, there's just ... People have struggled to be upfront and honest, and everybody wants to be polite. Where you get to product market fit, and when you know have something is when you start hearing yeses.

我甚至不相信人们给我的理由。因为当风投给你不信的时候,你也不能相信,原因是,只是.人们一直在为诚实和诚实而奋斗,每个人都希望有礼貌。当你进入产品市场时,当你知道有什么东西的时候,你就会开始听到是的。

And so you just have to try, and if you can't get any yeses, well there's your signal that you don't have product market fit.

所以你必须试一试,如果你不能得到任何的支持,那么这就是你的信号,你不适合产品市场。

And if you can get yeses, there's your signal that you do have product market fit.

如果你能得到同意,这就是你的信号,你确实有适合的产品市场。

And I think that's all that matters. Yeah. Here.

我觉得这才是最重要的。嗯这里

Speaker 6: Hi, So while early on and you're prospecting for your first clients, you need to get your first signed agreement for your products. What is the importance of reference customers in terms of, would you prefer going after big brands, big names, even if they require far more work than going for companies that are [inaudible] we can close a deal [inaudible] ?

扬声器6:嗨,所以在早期,你正在寻找你的第一个客户,你需要得到你的第一个签署的协议为你的产品。参考客户的重要性在于,你是否更愿意追求大品牌、大企业,即使他们需要的工作远远多于那些(听不见的)公司-我们可以达成一笔交易(听不见的)?

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, that's a great question.

泰勒:是的,这是个很棒的问题。

It is how should you prioritize big companies, which would be amazing names and logos, if you had them as reference customers or small companies, which might be faster.

这是你应该如何优先考虑大公司,这将是惊人的名字和标志,如果你有他们作为参考客户或小公司,这可能会更快。

I think about the advice YC gives for investors, which is to do a breadth-first search, meaning optimized for speed and optimize for, I would say talk to all those companies, talk to the big company, talk to the small company, but then you'll know which ones can can move quickly and not.

我想到了YC给投资者的建议,那就是做一个广度优先的搜索,意思是对速度和优化进行优化,我会说,与所有这些公司交谈,与大公司交谈,与小公司交谈,但这样你就会知道哪些公司可以快速行动。

And optimize for speed.

优化速度。

A customer is better than then no customer.

顾客总比没有顾客好。

And the big companies are never the great references, you imagine necessarily.

你可以想象,大公司从来都不是伟大的推荐人。

I would go for who needs your product the most and who will move quickly.

我会去找谁最需要你的产品,谁会迅速行动。

And the reference stuff and the logo stuff, I don't think you have to worry about that in the early days. You're just looking for validation and customers. Yeah. Over here.

参考资料和标志,我不认为你必须担心在早期的日子。你只是在寻找验证和客户。嗯在这边。

Maryanne: Hi, Maryanne, [inaudible] .

玛丽安:嗨,玛丽安,[听不见]。

I'd like to hear about your pricing journey. We are interested customers but we're beginning to now get nervous about the pricing. So, wanted to hear about your journey, [inaudible] did at sales at the UCLA [inaudible] .

我想听听你们的定价之旅。我们有兴趣的客户,但我们现在开始感到紧张的价格。所以,想听听你的旅程,在加州大学洛杉矶分校(UCLA)的销售部做过。

Tyler Bosmeny: Oh, nice. Oh, great to meet you. So your question was about the pricing journey. Yeah.

泰勒·博斯梅尼:哦,不错。很高兴见到你。所以你的问题是关于定价之旅。嗯

And how to set pricing? That is a hard question, because it's so specific to every company.

以及如何确定价格?这是一个很难回答的问题,因为它对每一家公司都是如此具体。

I'll tell you what we did at Clever. We guessed and you get feedback.

我来告诉你我们在聪明的时候做了什么。我们猜到了,你得到了反馈。

It's actually kind of neat. You get feedback from the market pretty quickly and in the early days, you can iterate. Patrick McKenzie likes to talk about how most startup founders need to charge more, and will usually guess too low. So maybe one strategy for guessing would be to guess a number that seems reasonable to you and if you can close that sale, try doubling it the next time and if you can close that sale, try doubling it again.

其实挺不错的。你很快就能从市场上得到反馈,在最初的日子里,你可以迭代。帕特里克·麦肯齐(PatrickMcKenzie)喜欢谈论大多数初创公司创始人需要如何提高收费,而且通常会猜测得太低。因此,一种猜测策略可能是猜测一个对你来说是合理的数字,如果你能完成销售,下次尝试加倍,如果你能完成销售,再试一次加倍。

It's really hard to know what customers will pay. But I'll tell you that original deal I mentioned for $100,000 that we closed very early on. Why was it $100,000 and not half of that or double that? It was just us doing a little bit of this and guessing. But we got feedback and iterated from there on the pricing model. So I think you just got to try things, be bold, whatever you say, you got to believe it, "This is the right price for our product, there's no other price that would be fair for this thing." But then quickly, be willing to iterate as you get that feedback. Yeah, no problem.

很难知道顾客会付多少钱。但我要告诉你的是,我之前提到的100,000美元的原始交易,我们很早就完成了。为什么是100,000美元,而不是其中的一半或两倍?只是我们做了一点猜测。但我们得到了反馈,然后在定价模型上进行了迭代。所以我认为你只需要尝试一些东西,大胆一点,不管你说什么,你都要相信,“这是我们产品的正确价格,没有其他的价格是公平的。”但是很快,当你得到反馈的时候,要愿意迭代。是啊没问题。

In the back there. Yeah.

在后面。嗯

Speaker 8: Yeah. What do you suggest for subscription-based businesses like [inaudible] ?

演讲者8:是的。你对以订阅为基础的业务有什么建议,比如(听不到)?

Tyler Bosmeny: I'm not sure I understand the question.

泰勒·博斯梅尼:我不确定我是否理解这个问题。

Speaker 8: For the subscription-based startups.

演讲者8:订阅型创业公司。

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah.

泰勒:是的。

Speaker 8: [inaudible] .

演讲者8:[听不见]。

Any new customer, if you just rely on the marketing, they don't have [inaudible] and then rely on marketing or how [inaudible] ?

任何新客户,如果你只是依靠市场营销,他们没有(听不见的),然后依赖营销或如何(听不见)?

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah. So the question is, if you're talking about a $50 price point for a product, early on in a company's journey, how do you bootstrap a sales effort around that? I mean, if you're talking about a $50 product, even $50 per month, basically you probably shouldn't do any of these things.

泰勒:是的。所以问题是,如果你说的是一个产品的50美元的价格点,在公司之旅的早期,你是如何引导销售努力的呢?我的意思是,如果你说的是一个50美元的产品,甚至每月50美元,基本上你可能不应该做任何这些事情。

And you shouldn't set invest in a marketing function, because you are going to need so many customers and you can't do it in a high touch way. So, I look at things like demand generation and email campaigns and self service signup flows and referral codes and things that companies at that small price point have to do to be scalable, or raise the price of your product to support true sales, either way. But that's probably how I'd approach it.

你不应该投资于市场营销功能,因为你需要这么多的客户,而且你不能以一种高超的方式去做。所以,我看一些东西,比如需求生成、电子邮件活动、自助服务注册流程和推荐代码,以及公司在这个小价格点上必须做的事情,或者提高产品的价格,以支持真正的销售,无论是哪种方式。但这可能就是我处理它的方法。

Speaker 8: [inaudible] .

演讲者8:[听不见]。

Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah.

泰勒:是的。

Speaker 8: So there's nothing on your website, so to get the first customers-

扬声器8:所以你的网站上什么都没有,所以为了让第一批顾客-

Tyler Bosmeny: Why isn't there anything on your website?

泰勒:为什么你的网站上什么都没有?

Speaker 8: [inaudible] .

演讲者8:[听不见]。

Tyler Bosmeny: There's no product. Oh, other than the product. That's something. Okay. Sometimes founders do this, he said, "But what if there's not enough case studies on our website for people to come buy?" A lot of founders think, they know it's never enough. Whatever they have is never enough to get people to buy.

泰勒·博斯梅尼:没有产品。除了产品。那是件事。好的。有时创始人会这么做,他说,“但如果我们的网站上没有足够的案例研究,让人们来买呢?”很多创始人认为,他们知道这是远远不够的。他们拥有的一切永远不足以让人们购买。

If they had one more reference account, if they had a few more case studies. That's what it would take for people to buy. Guess what? If you go on the Wayback Machine for clever.com from 2012, we didn't have any case studies, we didn't have any customer testimonials.

如果他们有更多的参考帐户,如果他们有更多的案例研究。这就是人们要买的东西。你猜怎么着?如果你从2012年开始使用Wayback Machine for clever.com,我们没有任何案例研究,也没有任何客户推荐信。

All we had was a page that described the product and that was enough to get. For people who had the need, they didn't care about any of that. They were like, "Oh, finally, someone's build a solution to my problem. Great.

我们所拥有的只是一页描述产品的页面,这已经足够了。对于那些有需要的人来说,他们根本不在乎这些。他们说,“哦,终于有人想办法解决我的问题了。太好了。”

I will run through walls to get it." And we didn't, maybe we have some of that stuff five, six years in, but we certainly didn't have it at the beginning. So, yeah, over here.

我会穿墙去拿它。“我们没有,也许我们五六年后就有了一些东西,但是我们在开始的时候肯定没有。所以,是的,在这里。

Speaker 9: On your way from mathematician to expert salesperson, what's resources did you find the most useful?

演讲者9:在你从数学家到专家销售员的路上,你发现最有用的资源是什么?

Tyler Bosmeny: Sorry. One more time.

泰勒:对不起。再来一次。

Speaker 9: On your way from mathematician to dope salesperson what resources did you find the most useful?

演讲者9:在你从数学家到毒品销售员的路上,你发现最有用的资源是什么?

Tyler Bosmeny: Oh, what resources? Yeah, the question's what resources have I learned in doing sales? Well, first there's no substitute for doing it.

泰勒:哦,什么资源?是的,问题是我在做销售时学到了什么资源?首先,做这件事是无可替代的。

I've read a number of books on sales. I've watched things online. 95% of what I've learned has just come from trying it over and over again.

我读过许多关于销售的书。我在网上看过东西。我学到的95%都是一遍又一遍的尝试。

And actually, it really appeals to the math and statistics side of me because you kind of get to EB test everything. Yeah, you try something new in a conversation, "Oh, that didn't really work. Okay, I'm going to try something again." You just get to iterate over and over and over again.

事实上,它对我的数学和统计方面很有吸引力,因为你可以对所有的东西进行电子束测试。是的,你在谈话中尝试一些新的东西,“哦,那不太管用。好吧,我要再试一次。”你只需要一次又一次地迭代。

And so that is the number one way to learn sales. There are some books, there's this one that I love, it's called, How I Picked Myself Up from Failure to Success in Selling.

因此,这是学习销售的第一条途径。有一些书,有一本我喜欢的,叫做,我是如何从失败到成功的销售中振作起来的。

It's from the 1950s and it's written in this hokey, corny way. But it so beautifully encapsulates the journey of learning sales and some of the hustle and things that I was describing as part of it earlier. So that's one resource I've recommended to founders. But really, you just got to try it. Okay, last question. Yes, you look like you have a question.

它是从20世纪50年代开始的,它是用一种老掉牙、老土的方式写的。但它如此完美地概括了学习销售的过程,以及我之前描述的一些忙乱和事情。这是我推荐给创始人的一种资源。但真的,你只要试一试就行了。好的,最后一个问题。是的,你看起来有个问题。

Speaker 10: So you told us about how you started [inaudible] your sales, but can you tell us about your first few hires? Or your [inaudible] sales team, how did you promote them, [inaudible] ?

演讲者10:所以你告诉我们你是如何开始销售的,但是你能告诉我们你最初的几个雇员吗?或者你的[听不到的]销售团队,你是如何推销他们的,[听不到的]?


演讲者10:所以你告诉我们你是如何开始销售的,但是你能告诉我们你最初的几个雇员吗?或者你的[听不到的]销售团队,你是如何推销他们的,[听不到的]?

Tyler Bosmeny: Sure. Hiring salespeople, first of all, you have no business hiring salespeople until you've done a lot of sales on your own. Could be good.

泰勒:当然。招聘销售人员,首先,在你自己做了很多销售之前,你没有义务雇佣销售人员。可能是好事。

And the reason is not just because of what I was saying earlier about how you know, good you are, it's because you won't even know what kind of people to hire until you've done a lot of sales on your own. You won't know what the core skills are. Is it traveling a lot? Is it a lot of phone calls? Is it a lot of like really good emails? You just won't know. Once you have done sales for a while, the good news is you'll know exactly the kind of people that you should hire and typically that's how I've done it. So I've done sales by myself for three, six, nine, 12 months, made it repeatable to a degree.

原因不仅仅是因为我之前说过你是多么的好,这是因为在你自己做了大量的销售之前,你甚至不知道该雇什么样的人。你不会知道核心技能是什么。经常旅行吗?有很多电话吗?很像很好的电子邮件吗?你就是不知道。一旦你做了一段时间的销售,好消息是你会知道你应该雇佣什么样的人,通常我就是这样做的。所以我自己做了3,6,9,12个月的销售,在一定程度上达到了重复性。

And then there's literature out there about what you want your first sales reps to look like, and oftentimes a term that's used, Renaissance sales rep.

还有一些关于你想让你的第一位销售代表看起来像什么的文献,而且通常是一个术语,文艺复兴时期的销售代表。

And that's kind of differentiating from the coin-operated sales rep. Coin-operated meaning they need everything, they need every piece of collateral, every playbook, every script but then they can go out and execute on it just relentlessly. On the other side of that spectrum you have the Renaissance reps, what you needed to start up.

这和投币销售代表的不同之处。投币意味着他们需要一切,他们需要每一块抵押品,每一本剧本,每一个剧本,但是他们可以毫不留情地出去执行。在这个范围的另一边,你有文艺复兴代表,你需要启动的东西。

And these are folks who don't need a lot of direction, don't need a lot of playbook and they just love figuring things out and probably your earliest trap, even at Clever today were renaissance, but bigger companies will have much more on the other end of the spectrum.

这些人不需要太多的方向,不需要太多的剧本,他们只是喜欢搞清楚,也许是你最早的陷阱,即使在今天聪明的时候也是复兴,但大公司在另一端会有更多的东西。

And so you want to look for those renaissance players who really love to learn, oftentimes they'll have some industry expertise, but maybe not too much. You probably don't need the person as your first salesperson who has just ... You probably don't want someone ... Don't be too blown away by 50 years of experience. Not that that's bad, but you can probably get away if you have the hustle and the grit. That's what's most important at this stage, more than experience and so, yeah, those are the things I look for. So a lot of energy, a lot of passion, kind of that renaissance sales rep mentality and then pattern matching to what I've been doing in the sales process if they have those skills. Great. Thank you. Thanks guys.

所以你想找那些真正喜欢学习的文艺复兴玩家,他们通常会有一些行业的专业知识,但也许不会太多。你可能不需要这个人作为你的第一个销售员。你可能不想找人.。不要因为50年的经验而感到震惊。这并不是坏事,但你可能会逃脱,如果你有勇气和勇气。在这个阶段,这是最重要的,不仅仅是经验,所以,是的,这就是我想要的东西。所以很多的精力,很多的激情,一种文艺复兴时期的销售代表的心态,然后与我在销售过程中所做的事情相匹配,如果他们有这些技能的话。太棒了谢谢。谢谢各位。
