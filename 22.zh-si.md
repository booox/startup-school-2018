# Understanding SAFEs and Priced Equity Rounds by Kirsty Nathoo

#了解SAFE和定价股票轮


Geoff Ralston: I would like to introduce Kirsty, who is going to talk, in much detail about  safes, notes, equity and the like. Kirsty.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我想介绍一下基尔斯蒂，他将详细介绍SAFE，票据，股票等等。基尔斯蒂。

Kirsty Nathoo: All right, good morning everybody. So my name is Kirsty Nathoo. I'm the CFO, one  of the partners here at YCombinator and I have now worked with probably over 1500  companies in terms of getting them incorporated, doing a YC investments and then seeing them  through their subsequent raises, either on convertible instruments or on equity rounds. I've seen kind  of a lot by now, and so this presentation is to give you some understanding  of some of the things that people don't necessarily understand when they're raising money and  to hopefully help you avoid some of the pitfalls that we've seen with ... Some  of the mistakes that we've seen founders make.
The key message in all of this  presentation is that it's important that you understand at all stages of the company's life  cycle, how much of the company you've sold to investors, and in connection with that,  how much therefore, you also own.
The thing that makes this complicated is that most  companies will raise money on convertible instruments first, and because those convertible instruments aren't yet  shares, is not immediately obvious for a lot of founders, how much of the company  they've sold. I'm going to talk through some of the mechanics of that and help  you understand how all that works, so that you don't get surprised when it's too  late and you can't do anything about it.
The other thing that you should also  be aware of is that a lot of companies and a lot of founders will  just say, "Oh, I don't need to worry about my cap table. My lawyers deal  with my cap table. I don't need to worry." Actually, that's a really dangerous statements.  Again, you should make sure that you're understanding this. It's your responsibility as the CEO  or the founder of the company to understand all of this.
There's lots of ways  that you can maintain your cap table.
There's lots of ways that you can keep  track of this, and the simplest form is just a spreadsheet. All it's going to  show us who owns how many shares and that's it. That's all you need at  the beginning, but there are other services out there that can help. I'll, include them  on a list of, of resources after the presentation, but there's tools like captable.io and  Carter, which also help for you to keep track of these things.
These are the  three sections that I'm going to talk about. First of all, I'm going to talk  about safes. Particularly for US companies. Most companies will raise money first on safes or  some other convertible instruments, which I will talk about briefly as well.

好的，大家早上好。我叫柯斯蒂·纳苏。我是首席财务官，YCombinator公司的合伙人之一，我现在已经和1500多家公司合作过，包括让他们成立公司，进行YC投资，然后再通过可转换工具或股票轮融资，让他们完成随后的融资。我已经看到了很多，所以这个演讲是为了让你了解一些人们在筹集资金时不一定理解的事情，并希望能帮助你避免我们看到的一些陷阱。我们看到创始人犯的一些错误。所有这些介绍的关键信息是，在公司生命周期的所有阶段，了解公司卖给投资者的公司的多少，以及与此相关的，你也拥有多少，这是很重要的。让这件事变得复杂的是，大多数公司首先会通过可转换工具筹集资金，因为那些可转换工具还不是股票，所以对于很多创始人来说，他们出售了多少公司并不是显而易见的。我将讨论一下这方面的一些机制，并帮助你理解所有这些是如何工作的，这样你就不会在为时已晚的时候感到惊讶，而且你什么也做不了。另一件你也应该注意的事情是，很多公司和许多创始人会说：“哦，我不需要担心我的帽桌。我的律师处理我的帽桌。我不需要担心。实际上，这是个非常危险的说法。再说一次，你应该确保你明白这一点。作为公司的CEO或创始人，你有责任理解这一切。有很多方法可以维持你的帽子表。有很多方法可以跟踪这一点，最简单的形式就是电子表格。它将告诉我们谁拥有多少股份，仅此而已。这是你一开始所需要的，但是还有其他的服务可以帮助你。我将在演示后将它们包括在资源列表中，但是有captable.io和Carter这样的工具，它们也有助于您跟踪这些信息。这是我要讲的三个部分。首先，我要谈谈保险箱。尤其是对美国公司来说。大多数公司将首先通过SAFE或其他可转换工具筹集资金，我也将简要地讨论这些问题。

And I know  Jeff mentioned the safe last week in a little bit of detail, but I'm going  to go into much more detail on that and also how the sections of the  safe works.
The S stands for simple and so hopefully you will believe me with  that, and you will be ready to understand what's going on in that safe as  you come out of this presentation.
Then we'll talk some more about dilution again so  that you can see we're going to walk through the lifecycle of a company from  incorporation up to raising a priced series all round, so that you can see how  things change over that period.

我知道Jeff上周提到了保险箱的一些细节，但我会更详细地讨论这个问题，以及安全部分是如何工作的。S代表简单，所以希望你能相信我，当你从这个演讲中出来的时候，你会准备好去了解这个保险箱里发生了什么。然后我们再讨论一些关于稀释的问题，这样你就可以看到，我们将走过公司的整个生命周期，从公司成立到全面提高定价系列，这样你就可以看到在这段时间里事情是如何变化的。

And then I'll give you some top tips on other,  other items to do with raising money. All right, so first of all the safe.  So let's cover what it is and then we'll go through the details of how  a safe is built up. As I said, safe, the S stands for simple, the  rest of it is a Simple Agreement for Future Equity and put simply, it's a  instrument where the investor will give you money, now, in exchange for a promise from  the company to give shares to the investor at a future date, when you raise  money on a priced round, There are minimal negotiations with a safe. Really, there's only  two things that you probably going to negotiate with the investor, which is how much  money you going to ... How much money the investor will put into the company  and at what valuation cap. Really those two things are the things to negotiate, whereas  when you compare that with a priced round, there's a whole raft of things to  negotiate, and that's what makes the priced round a lot harder to close and to  raise money on them than a safe does. That's why often companies will start with  a safe and then when they get to the point of being able to raise  more money, and they have a lead investor, which that negotiate with for the priced  round, then the safes, when they convert into shares, will piggyback on the terms that  has been negotiated with the lead investor in the priced round.
The other thing to  bear in mind is that a safe is not debt. Some of you will have  raised on what's known as convertible debt. That's a different instrument. Debt has generally an  interest rate attached to it and it has a maturity date, where the debt needs  to be repaid. Safes have neither of those things. So it's important to understand that  there is a distinction between the two instruments, but in terms of conversion, in the  way that they convert in a priced round, there are some similarities. This is the  first section in the safe and this paragraph, actually includes pretty much all the key  details that you need to understand in a safe. It talks about in exchange for  payment by investor, you're going to be investors putting in a certain amount of dollars  around the date and down here, the valuation cap is some number. Really those two  blanks are the two negotiating points. This paragraph here is something that we've added just  recently in our newest version of safes and this is something that will hopefully help  you so that once you've read our safe that we have available on our website,  once. If there's this paragraph on the safe, then you know that you have read  the safe.
The idea behind this is that if anything changes in the safe, either  the company or the investor cannot say this paragraph. It can't say that it's the  same as the safe that's on the YCombinator website, and so you'll know as a  founder that you should be looking at it more closely to see what's been changed.  This is just something to keep your eyes open for if you receive a safe  from an investor. Okay. So the anatomy of the safe is pretty straightforward. It's only  five pages in length, so it's not very long. We tried really hard to keep  the language not too legal, so it's easy to understand and really it split into  five sections. Section one talks about what happens in a various different sets of events.  Most of the time what's going to happen is there will be an equity financing  at some point in the future, and so the first part of the section talks  about what happens then, how does the safe convert? Or there might be a liquidity  event, either the company might get sold before the safe converts. So it's also addresses  what happens if the company is sold whilst the safest still outstanding. Or the company  might decide to close down whilst the safe still outstanding, so it also addresses that.  Those are the three real key events that might drive change from the safe, so  it addresses all of those. Often we get questions from founders or from investors saying,  "But what happens if?" Actually these three sections are the answers to pretty much all  of those questions.
Then there's a couple of other sections where we clarified the liquidation  priority, which just means who comes first in the queue to be repaid in these  different situations. Also clarifying that the safe actually terminates; i.e, it does no longer exist  if any of the top three events happen. So that section is kind of your  instruction booklet. If something happens in your company, that's the section you look at to  see what happens to your safe.
Then the next section, section two is just the  definition section. So anything that we referred to within the safe will be explained in  section two. If you're not sure what the company capitalization definition is, you go to  section two to look at that for an explanation. Section three are the representations that  the company makes to the investor. So it's saying things like the company is duly  formed. It's correctly formed in Delaware. Section four is the representations that the investors make  to the company. So it's things like the investor saying, "Yes, I agree I'm an  accredited investor." Then section five is kind of legal boiler plate language that needs to  be in there. Really from your point of view, the sections that you really need  to understand are sections one and sections two. Obviously you need to know what you're  representing in section three as well, but those section one and section two, are the  key key parts, and that bit is only three pages long of the safe. I'm  pretty sure you can all read three pages and understand what's going on. I encourage  you to do that. Some of you may have heard, in the last couple of  weeks, we announced to move to a different type of safe. We've introduced concept of  post money safes, and it's important that we understand what post money means. What it  basically means is after all the safes have converted, what happens at that point, and  we'll go into that in a little bit more detail in a moment, but it's  easy to get confused about what post money means here, but it's after all the  safes.
The reason why we introduced these is that we wanted to make it easier  for founders to understand the dilution that they were taking; i.e, how much of the  company they'd sold to investors and so how much less of the company they owned.  It's a lot easier to to understand that with post money safes than with the  previous safes that we had, which were known as pre money safes. Basically, when we're  talking about pre money and post money, we're talking about the same thing. It's just  a different way to express it, to explain it. In both a priced round done  for safes, the formula stays the same. So the pre money valuation plus the amounts  of money raised, equals the post money valuation of the company. So if you have  a $5 million pre money valuation and you raise a $1 million, then the post  money valuation of the company is $6 million. That's important to remember in a moment,  but really, that's as simple as it gets.
Then based on that, so that you  can understand how much of the company you sold when you're raising money on safes.  The formula is just your ownership or the ownership of the investors, the ownership that  the investors will take, is their amount raised divided by the post money evaluation in  the case of a priced round or valuation cap in the case of a safe.  So in our example before, if the investors we're putting in $1 million and the  post money valuation was $6 million, then they will own 16.67% of the company. Does  that all make sense to everybody? So far? Okay, good. I'm going to talk only  about safes with valuation caps here to keep things simple, but just be aware that  there are other different flavors of safes that you can use and that you may  have already used or that you may find that you use in future. So the,  maybe the concept of a discount instead of a cap. Instead of capping the valuation  that say $6 million, it says, there's a, there's a 20% discount on the series  a price.
There's also an uncapped safe, which basically just says, "I'm going to put  money in now as an investor, and when you do a priced round, I'll get  the same price as the priced round investors are going to get." That's pretty uncommon  because the investors who are putting in money early, want some kind of bonus for  putting in the money early. It's pretty unlikely that you'll, you'll use one of those.  Then finally there's a safe uncapped with a most favored nation clause, which basically what  that says is, "I'm not going to agree a cap right now, but if you  raise some money from some other investors, who do have a cap and that's how  those terms are better than my terms, I get their terms as well as an  investor." This one can sometimes happen if you're raising money very early on and you  don't really know what the cap is and maybe you just want to punt it  for another month or two, but it just creates a little bit more admin for  the founders because it's another thing that they have to keep track of. We see  them sometimes, again, not all that common. By far the most common is just the  valuation cap only. All right, so now we understand safes and how they're made up.  We're going to talk about dilution and understanding how your cap tables work. All right,  so we're going to walk through this process. So we're going to start with our  company, its incorporation, which Carolyn talked about right at the start of the startup school  course I believe. So hopefully this will not be anything new to you.
Then we're  going to talk about what happens when you raise money on safes, some post money  safes.
Then we're going to talk about what happens as you hire people and start  to issue equity to employees, and then the company is going to do a price  round, and so what happens to the cap table at that point? Now I'll warn  you, this is starting to get into the math section of the whole thing, so  turn your brains on and keep concentrating. All right, so incorporation. So let's just assume  it's a really simple company.
There's two founders and they split their shares equally between  the two of them. So in this example, each founder owns 4.625 million shares. So  there's a total of 9.25 million shares issued, and each founder owns 50%. That's pretty  straightforward, right? At this point, in order for them to own those shares, the founders  have done the paperwork, they've granted those shares through a restricted stock purchase agreement and  this vesting on those shares, as was talked about with Carolyn earlier in the course.  Then the next thing that's going to happen is this company raises some money on  a post money safe and they raised from two investors.
The first investor comes in  quite early and they put in $200,000 at a $4 million post money valuation cap.  Then a little bit later on investor B comes in, puts in 800,000 at an  $8 million post money valuation cap. So if you remember back to our formulas, the  ownership that investor A has at this point, is there amounts of money that they've  put in divided by the post money valuation cap, which gives them 5% of the  company. Same for investor B, 800,000, over 8 million, which gives them 10% of the  company. So in total, the founders at this stage have sold 15% of the company.  So even though this doesn't change the actual cap table, because these aren't shares at  this point, this is just a safe. This is just a promise to give shares  in future.
The founders should know at this stage that they have sold 15% of  the company, and if they sold 15% of the company, then they can no longer  own 100% of the company. Now instead of the foam does owning 100% of the  company, between them, they've been diluted by the 15%. So they're going down to 85%  of the company. It's important to have that in your brain when you're raising money,  because whilst the cap table, like I say, doesn't change, the fact that you've just  sold 15% of the company, is an important fact. It's an important thing to know  because you want to make sure that you're not selling too much of the company,  because you know that there's a lot of future fundraisings that are going to happen  with the company.
Therefore there's going to be more future dilution. Is everyone happy with  how we've got to that 15%? Yes.
The question.

然后，我会给你一些关于其他，其他与筹款有关的最重要的建议。好吧，首先是保险箱。因此，让我们讨论一下它是什么，然后我们将详细介绍如何建立一个安全装置。就像我说的，安全，S代表简单，其余的是一个简单的未来股权协议，简单地说，这是一种工具，投资者会给你钱，现在，作为交换，公司承诺在未来某个日期将股票给投资者，当你在定价的一轮融资时，与外管局进行的谈判是微乎其微的。实际上，只有两件事你可能要和投资者协商，那就是你要花多少钱.投资者将向公司投入多少资金，估值上限是多少。事实上，这两件事是要谈判的，而当你把它和一个定价回合进行比较的时候，有一大堆东西要谈判，这就是为什么价格轮比一个保险箱更难完成和筹集资金的原因。这就是为什么公司通常会从SAFE开始，然后当他们能够筹集到更多的资金时，他们有一个主要的投资者，与他们谈判定价的一轮，然后SAFE，当他们转换成股票的时候，会根据在定价回合中与主要投资者谈判过的条款。要记住的另一件事是，保险箱不是债务。你们中的一些人会为所谓的可转换债券筹集资金。那是另一种乐器。债务通常附有利率，而且有一个到期日，债务需要偿还。保险箱里没有这两样东西。因此，重要的是要理解这两种工具之间的区别，但在转换方面，它们在一个定价轮中的转换方式，有一些相似之处。这是保险箱的第一节，这一段实际上包括了你需要在SAFE中理解的所有关键细节。它说的是作为投资者付款的交换，你将是投资者在日期前后投入一定数额的美元，估值上限是某个数字。实际上，这两个空白是两个谈判点。这一段是我们最近在最新版本的保险箱中添加的东西，希望能帮助你，一旦你读了我们的SAFE，我们就可以在我们的网站上找到它，一次。如果SAFE上有这段话，你就知道你看过SAFE了。这背后的想法是，如果SAFE有任何变化，公司或投资者都不能说这段话。它不能说它和YCombinator网站上的保险箱是一样的，所以你会知道作为一个创始人，你应该更仔细地观察它，看看发生了什么变化。这只是让你睁大眼睛的东西，因为如果你收到了投资者的SAFE。好的。所以保险箱的解剖很简单。它只有五页长，所以不是很长。我们非常努力地保持语言不太合法，所以它很容易理解，实际上它分为五个部分。第一节讨论了在不同的事件集合中发生的事情。大多数情况下，未来的某个时候会出现股权融资，所以这一节的第一部分将讨论接下来会发生什么，安全转换是如何进行的？或者可能会发生流动性事件，要么是公司在安全皈依者之前就被出售了。因此，它也涉及到，如果公司被出售，而最安全的仍然悬而未决。或者，公司可能会决定在SAFE尚未完工的时候关闭，所以它也解决了这一问题。这是三个真正的关键事件，可能会驱动更改从SAFE，所以它解决了所有这些。我们经常会从创始人或投资者那里得到问题，“但是如果发生了什么呢？”实际上，这三个部分是对几乎所有这些问题的答案。还有另外几个部分，我们澄清了清算优先权，这意味着在不同的情况下，谁排在第一位就会被偿还。还澄清了保险箱实际上是终止的；也就是说，如果前三大事件发生，它就不再存在。所以那部分是你的说明书。如果你的公司发生了什么事情，那就是你要查看的部分，看看你的SAFE发生了什么。下一节，第二节就是定义部分。因此，我们在SAFE内提到的任何事情都将在第二节中解释。如果你不确定公司资本化的定义是什么，你可以到第二节去看这个解释。第三节是公司对投资者的陈述。所以说公司已经正式成立了。它是在特拉华州正确形成的。第四部分是投资者对公司的陈述。就像投资者说，“是的，我同意我是一个合格的投资者。”第五节是一种需要在其中的法律锅炉板块语言。从你的角度来看，你真正需要理解的部分是第一节和第二节。很明显，你也需要知道你在第三节中代表了什么，但是第一节和第二节是关键部分，这个部分只有三页长的保险箱。我敢肯定你们都能读三页就能理解到底发生了什么。我鼓励你这么做。你们中的一些人可能听说过，在过去的几周里，我们宣布转移到另一种类型的SAFE。我们引入了邮政货币SAFE的概念，理解邮政货币的含义是很重要的。它的基本意思是，在所有的SAFE都被改造之后，在那个时候发生了什么，我们稍后会更详细地讨论这个问题，但是我们很容易就会对邮局的钱意味着什么感到困惑，但毕竟它是所有的保险箱。我们推出这些公司的原因是，我们希望让创始人更容易理解他们所接受的稀释；也就是说，他们向投资者出售了多少公司，以及他们所拥有的公司的数量有多少。这是一个更容易理解的邮政货币SAFE比以前的SAFE，这是众所周知的前货币SAFE。基本上，当我们谈论前钱和邮寄钱时，我们谈论的是同样的事情。这只是一种不同的表达方式，用来解释它。在为SAFE做的一轮定价中，公式保持不变。因此，前货币估值加上筹集的资金数额，等于公司的后货币估值。因此，如果你有500万美元的预钱估值，并筹集了100万美元，那么该公司的邮资估值为600万美元。记住这一点很重要，但实际上，这是最简单的。然后在此基础上，让你了解你在为SAFE筹集资金时卖出了多少公司。公式仅仅是你的所有权或投资者的所有权，投资者将拥有的所有权，是他们筹集的金额除以后的货币评估，在一个定价的圆周率或估价上限的情况下，在安全的情况下。因此，在我们之前的例子中，如果我们投入100万美元的投资者，而邮局的估值是600万美元，那么他们将拥有该公司16.67%的股份。这对每个人都有意义吗？到目前为止。好的，很好。为了保持简单，我将只谈论带有估值上限的SAFE，但请注意，您可以使用其他不同类型的保险箱，您可能已经使用过，或者您可能会发现您将来会使用。所以，也许是折扣的概念，而不是上限。它并没有限制600万美元的估值，而是说，这个系列的价格有20%的折扣。还有一个没有上限的SAFE，基本上是说，“我现在作为一个投资者要投入资金，当你做一个定价轮，我将得到与定价的圆投资者将得到的相同的价格。”这是非常罕见的，因为那些提前投入资金的投资者希望提前投入资金会得到某种奖励。你不太可能，你会用其中之一。最后，有一个安全的、无上限的最惠国条款，它的基本意思是，“我现在不会同意上限，但如果你从其他投资者那里筹集一些资金，他们确实有上限，这就是这些条款比我的条款更好的方式，我得到了他们的条件，也得到了投资者的条件。”这种情况有时会发生，如果你很早就筹集到资金，你不知道上限是什么，也许你只是想把它押上一两个月，但它只是为创始人创造了更多的管理，因为这是另一件他们必须关注的事情。我们有时再一次看到它们，并不是很普遍。到目前为止，最常见的只是估值上限。好吧，现在我们了解SAFE和它们是怎么组成的了。我们将讨论稀释和理解你的帽子表是如何工作的。好的，我们要走完这个过程。所以我们将从我们的公司开始，它的成立，我相信卡罗琳在创业学校课程的一开始就谈到了这个问题。希望这对你来说不是什么新鲜事。然后我们将讨论当你在SAFE上筹集资金的时候会发生什么，一些邮政SAFE。然后，我们将讨论当你雇佣员工并开始向员工发行股票时会发生什么，然后公司将进行一轮价格谈判，那么在那个时候，上限表会发生什么呢？现在我要警告你，这开始进入整个过程的数学部分，所以打开你的大脑，继续集中注意力。好吧，那么合并。所以让我们假设这是一个非常简单的公司。有两位创始人，两人平分股份。在这个例子中，每个创始人都拥有462.5万股票。总共发行了925万股，每一位创始人都拥有50%的股份。很简单，对吧？在这一点上，为了让他们拥有这些股份，创建者们已经完成了文件工作，他们通过一份限制性股票购买协议和这些股份的归属来授予这些股份，就像课程早些时候与Carolyn谈到的那样。接下来会发生的事情是，这家公司通过一笔存款SAFE筹集了一些资金，他们从两个投资者那里筹集到了资金。第一位投资者来的很早，他们投入20万美元，以400万美元后的货币估值上限。然后稍晚一点，投资者B进来，投入80万美元，达到800万美元的后货币估值上限。所以，如果你还记得我们的公式，投资者A在这一点上拥有的所有权，就是他们投入的资金数量除以后货币估值上限，这给了他们公司5%的股份。投资者B，800，000，800，000，000，000，000，000，000，000，000，000，000，000，因此，这个阶段的创始人总共卖掉了公司15%的股份。因此，即使这并没有改变实际的上限表，因为在这一点上这些不是共享，这只是一个保险箱。这只是未来给股票的承诺。在这个阶段，创办人应该知道他们卖掉了公司15%的股份，如果他们卖掉了公司15%的股份，那么他们就不能再拥有100%的公司股份了。而不是泡沫公司拥有100%的股份，两者之间，他们被稀释了15%。所以他们将减少到85%的公司份额。当你筹集资金的时候，这一点很重要，因为尽管像我说的那样，上限表不会改变，但你刚刚卖掉了公司15%的股份，这是一个重要的事实。这是一件很重要的事情，因为你想确保你不会卖太多公司的股份，因为你知道公司将来会有很多筹资活动。因此，未来会有更多的稀释。每个人都对我们如何达到15%感到满意吗？是这个问题。

Audience: The founders are the only ones getting diluted at this point, earlier investor doesn't get  there?

观众：创始人是唯一在这一点上被稀释的人，更早的投资者没有做到这一点？

Kirsty Nathoo: Right. So the question is this, it's only the founders that are being diluted at  the moment and, yes, that's exactly right because that's the construct of the pot money  safes.
The later safe investors don't dilute the earliest safe investors. It just dilute the  existing shareholders, and at this stage, it's just the founders who are the existing shareholders.

基尔斯蒂·纳苏：对。所以问题是，现在只有创始人被稀释了，是的，这是完全正确的，因为这就是大麻钱SAFE的结构。后者的安全投资者不会稀释最早的安全投资者。它只是稀释现有的股东，在这个阶段，只有创始人才是现有的股东。

Audience: Does it make sense to buy shares in the treasury so that they can anticipate  a dilution?

观众：购买国库券的股票，这样他们就能预料到稀释是有意义的吗？

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So the question is, does it make sense to have shares authorized [inaudible] I  think is what you mean. At this stage it doesn't necessarily make a difference as  you'll see in a moment. You actually create new shares that you're going to issue  to these safe holders when they convert. At this stage is, it's fine to just  have the shares that the founders have and maybe some that you want to give  out for hiring,

好的。所以问题是，让股票授权(听不见)有意义吗？我认为这就是你的意思。在这个阶段，这并不一定会产生影响，你一会儿就会看到。你实际上创造了新的股票，当他们转换的时候，你将发行给这些安全的持有者。在这个阶段，只要有创始人的股份，或者你想给出一些供雇佣的股份，就可以了，

Audience: Why investing, he has different post money valuation cap?

观众：为什么投资，他有不同的岗位货币估值上限？

Kirsty Nathoo: So the question is why do they have different post money valuation caps? In this  example, it could be for very any number of reasons, but in this example, we're  assuming that, this one happened maybe a month after incorporation and maybe this one happened  six months after incorporation and more has gone on in the company and so it's  slightly less risk and so the company has been able to negotiate a different cap.  Things changed through the company and it's totally fine to have different caps because as  you can see from here, you just calculate everything separately and then add it all  together. So companies raised a million dollars. First thing is probably going to do with  that money is hire some people and when you hire employees, you're probably going to  give them some equity. In this example, the company creates, at this stage a option  pool, otherwise known as an ESOP or an employee incentive plan.
There's lots of different  names for it. In this example, they have created a plan or a pool that  has 750,000 shares in it and they've issued out of their 650,000 shares to early  employees. This has now changed cap table because they've issued shares.
The fact that, that  this more shares being being issued means that the cap table changes because we now  have more shareholders. Now we have a total of 10 million shares that have been  ... Fully diluted basically means the combination of issued and set aside in the option  pool in this case. So now we have our founder's, instead of owning 100%, have  92.5% of the company, and the option plan in total is 7.5% of the company.  But remember those safes.
These founders don't actually have 92.5% because they have also sold  15% of the company. Actually, they own less than the 92.5%.
They actually own 85%  of that, which is about 78.6%. So again, this is where it gets dangerous for  the founders. If they forget about the safes, the founders are sitting there saying, "Well,  I own 92.5%, this is great. I own still loads of the company," and they  have forgotten about the safes and the dilution they're about to take from that. Again,  it's really important to keep track of how much you've sold on your safes so  that you can do that calculation and say, "Actually, I don't have 92.5%, I have  85% of that because I've sold 15% of the company," but is also these numbers  have been diluted by those safes as well. As you'll see in a moment, these  numbers change as well. Now we go into fast forward about let's say a year.  The company is doing well, it's raised the priced round and it has a term  sheet for the priced round, which says that the pre money valuation of the round  is $15 million and they're going to raise a total of $5 million of which  the lead investor, which is the investor that they do all of the negotiations with,  is going to invest $4 million. If you remember from our formula at the start,  the post money valuation is the pre money valuation plus the total raise. So the  Post money valuation is $20 million.
The other thing that gets negotiated as part of  the priced round is the option pool increase. So generally what happens is that the  investors in the series A will say, "Okay, we're going to put some money in.  We know that this money is going to go towards hiring. So we want you  to create an option pool for all the new employees that you're going to employ  and give equity to, in advance, so that it's sitting there ready for those employees."  Usually you see that the option pool is about 10%; might go up to about  15%, but anything more than that is, is fairly nonstandard. Yes. Where did that come  from? Oh over there, okay. Yes.

所以问题是，他们为什么有不同的岗位货币估值上限？在这个例子中，可能有很多原因，但是在这个例子中，我们假设，这个可能发生在注册后的一个月，也许这个发生在公司成立六个月之后，在公司里发生了更多的事情，所以风险稍微小一些，所以公司能够协商出一个不同的上限。公司的情况发生了变化，有不同的上限是完全可以的，因为从这里你可以看到，你只需分别计算每件事，然后把它加在一起。所以公司筹集了一百万美元。第一件事可能是用这笔钱雇佣一些人，当你雇佣员工时，你可能会给他们一些股权。在本例中，公司在此阶段创建了一个选项池，也称为职工持股计划或员工激励计划。有很多不同的名字。在本例中，他们创建了一个计划或一个池，其中包含750，000股，并将650，000股发放给早期员工。这已经改变了上限表，因为他们已经发行了股票。事实上，更多的股票被发行意味着上限表的改变，因为我们现在有更多的股东。现在我们总共有1000万股.在这种情况下，完全稀释意味着在期权池中发行和保留的组合。所以现在我们有了创始人的，而不是100%的，拥有公司92.5%的股份，而期权计划总共是7.5%的公司。但记住那些保险箱。这些创始人实际上没有92.5%的股份，因为他们也卖掉了公司15%的股份。事实上，他们的持股比例低于92.5%。他们实际上拥有85%的股份，约占78.6%。所以，这对创始人来说是危险的。如果他们忘了保险箱，创始人们就坐在那里说：“嗯，我拥有92.5%的股份，这太棒了。我仍然拥有很多公司。”他们已经忘记了SAFE和他们将要从中得到的稀释。同样重要的是，要知道你在SAFE上卖出了多少，这样你就可以计算出，“实际上，我没有92.5%，我有85%，因为我卖掉了公司的15%，“但这些数字也被这些SAFE稀释了。你一会儿就会看到，这些数字也会发生变化。现在我们开始快速前进，比如说一年。公司做得很好，它提高了价格，它有一份标价轮的条款表，它说这一轮的前一轮估值是1500万美元，他们将总共筹集500万美元，其中的主要投资者，也就是他们所有谈判的投资者，都将投资400万美元。如果你记得从我们的公式开始，邮政货币估值是前货币估值加总加薪。因此，邮报的估值为2000万美元。作为定价轮的一部分，谈判的另一件事是增加期权池。一般情况下，A系列的投资者会说，“好吧，我们要投入一些资金。我们知道这笔钱将用于招聘。因此，我们希望你为你将要雇用的所有新员工创建一个期权池，并预先给予股权，这样它就可以为这些员工做好准备。“通常，您会看到选项池约为10%；可能会上升到大约15%，但如果不是这样的话，则是相当不标准的。是那是从哪来的？哦，在那边，好吧。是

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is, is the 10% coming from founders or collectively, and you'll see in  a moment is going to dilute the existing shareholders and the safe holders, but it  doesn't dilute the new money.

Nathoo：问题是，10%来自创始人或集体，你很快就会看到，它会稀释现有股东和安全持有者，但它不会稀释新的资金。

Audience: How is the option pool represented of the cap table? Is it represented on the  cap table or what form does it take?

观众：帽表的选项池是如何表示的？它是在盖帽表上表示的还是以什么形式表示的？

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how is the option pool represented on the cap table? So if  we go back to here, we just show it so that we have the options  available from the pool that haven't been issued is a line, and anything that has  been issued from the pool is a separate line.
The reason why we show those  two things separately is that these shares are considered outstanding, they're considered issued whereas these  aren't, and so that's the difference between what ... That's what fully diluted means. It  means outstanding shares, which are these two lines, plus any shares reserved under the option  pool. All right. Where are we? Quick math question for, for you, what do we  expect that the lead investor will own? What percentage of the company do we think  the lead investor is going to own after the round closes?

Nathoo：问题是，选项池是如何在帽子表上表示的？因此，如果我们回到这里，我们只需要显示它，这样我们就可以从池中获得未发出的选项，而从池中发出的任何选项都是一个单独的行。我们分别展示这两件事的原因是，这些股票被认为是流通的，它们被认为是发行的，而这些股票却不是，所以这就是.这就是完全稀释意味着什么。这意味着流通股，也就是这两条线，再加上在期权池下保留的任何股份。好的我们具体是在哪里呢？快数学题，对你来说，我们期望主要投资者会拥有什么？我们认为，在本轮交易结束后，牵头投资者将拥有多大比例的公司？

Audience: 20?

观众：20？

Kirsty Nathoo: 20%, yeah, for the lead investor, 25% in total for all of the series A  investors.
The lead investor is going to put in $4 million divided by $20 million,  gives 20%. So you'll see in a minute, the cap table that that all works  through in the calculations, but it's always good to just do that quick check, so  that you can sense check what's going on in your cap table. All right, so  in a priced round where you have a weather company has raised money just on  post money safes and then has raised a priced round, three things will happen, and  these three things happen at the same time in terms of the documents, but in  terms of the calculations, it's important that the order is correct.
The three things with  post money safes is that the first thing that happens is the safes convert into  shares.
Then an options pool is increased or created if there isn't one already, and  then the new investors invest. You'll see in a minute how that all works through  with the calculations. Now, one other thing that starts to get a little bit confusing  here is one of the sort of the lingo of how this works is this  often the lawyers and the founders will talk about the safes being included in the  pre money, and what that's basically saying is that when the new investors invest, and  they calculate their price per share, the calculation includes the shares from the conversion of  the safes. So even though the safes themselves are referred to as post money safes,  that's talking about how the safes convert. This sentence where the safes are included in  the pre money is talking about how the series A price is calculated. It gets  a little bit confusing because it's talking about post money and pre money, but that's  just something to bear in mind when this happens. Obviously, at the time that you're  raising price round, you're going to have a lot of advisors. You're going to be  working with lawyers who can explain all of this to you as well. All right,  let's go through these three steps then.
The first step is our safes are going  to convert, and we already know because we've already done the calculation that these safes  are going to convert into 15% of the company. 15% of the company means 15%  of the total, fully diluted shares; both common shares and preferred shares. Investors get preferred  shares which have a different set of rights and privileges than the common shares, which  is what the founders and employees get. We have enough information here in the cap  table that we have here to calculate what the actual number of shares are here  because we know that they're going to be 15% of the total issued shares. So  we know that this is 85% of the total issued shares. So we know what  our total is, and then once we get the totals, we can work out what  5% of that is and what 10% of that is. After a bit of algebra,  these are the numbers that come through. Now at this point, we have 11,764,705 shares  in total because it's preferred shares plus common shares. Our first safe investor who we  said was going to have 5%, has 588,000 shares, which represents 5% of that 11.7  million. Our second safe investor has 10%. Now, it's important to remember that this is  partway through a whole process. It's part way through those three steps that are happening  in a priced round. Actually you never going to see your cap table looking like  this. This is just one step in the calculation, but it's just a breakout so  that you can see where that 15% has come from. You can also see here  that when we were saying that the founders, instead of owning I'm 92.5%, they owned  about 78%. You can see that here because they'd been diluted by that 15%, as  have the employees with their options. This is the post money part of the post  money safes, after the safes have converted, but before anything else has happened in relation  to the priced round. Got it? Okay. All right, so the next step is ...  Oh, we have a question. Okay.

基斯蒂·纳托：20%，是的，对于领头投资者来说，对所有A系列投资者来说，总共是25%。主要投资者将投入400万美元除以2000万美元，贡献20%。你很快就会看到，在计算中，所有的上限表都在工作，但是做快速检查总是很好的，这样你就能感觉到你的帽子表里发生了什么。好的，在一个有天气公司的价格圈里，公司只在邮政钱柜上筹到了钱，然后又赚了一笔，有三件事会发生，这三件事在文件上同时发生，但就计算而言，重要的是订单是正确的。邮政货币SAFE的三件事是，第一件事就是把SAFE转换成股票。然后，如果还没有期权池，就会增加或创建一个期权池，然后新的投资者进行投资。你很快就会看到这一切是如何进行计算的。现在，还有一件事开始让人有点困惑，这是一种行话，这是如何运作的-律师和创始人经常会谈论SAFE被包括在预投资中，这基本上是说，当新的投资者投资时，他们计算出他们的每股价格。计算包括从SAFE转换而来的份额。因此，即使保险箱本身被称为邮政货币SAFE，这也是关于SAFE是如何转换的。这句话把SAFE包括在预款里，这句话是在谈论A系列的价格是如何计算的。它有点混乱，因为它谈论的是邮政钱和预付费，但当这种情况发生时，要记住这一点。显然，在你提高价格的时候，你会有很多顾问。你要和律师合作，律师也可以向你解释这一切。好吧，让我们通过这三个步骤。第一步是我们的SAFE要转换，我们已经知道了，因为我们已经计算过这些SAFE将转换成公司的15%的股份。公司的15%指的是全部稀释股份的15%，包括普通股和优先股。投资者获得与普通股不同的权利和特权的优先股，这是创始人和员工所得到的。在上限表中，我们有足够的信息来计算股票的实际数量，因为我们知道它们将占发行股票总数的15%。因此，我们知道，这是总发行股份的85%。所以我们知道我们的总数是什么，然后一旦我们得到总数，我们就可以计算出5%的数字和10%的数字。经过一些代数之后，这些都是通过的数字。现在，我们总共有11，764，705股，因为它是优先股加普通股。我们的第一位安全投资者-我们说他将拥有5%的股份-拥有58.8万股票，占1170万股的5%。我们的第二个安全投资者有10%。现在，重要的是要记住，这是一个完整的过程。这是部分通过这三个步骤，正在发生在一个价格轮。实际上，你永远不会看到你的帽子桌像这样。这只是计算的一个步骤，但它只是一个突破，这样你就可以看到15%是从哪里来的。你也可以在这里看到，当我们说，创始人，而不是拥有我92.5%，他们拥有约78%。你可以在这里看到这一点，因为他们被稀释了15%，就像员工们的选择一样。这是邮政货币部分的邮政货币保险箱，在SAFE已经转换，但在其他任何事情已经发生与定价轮。明白了。好的。好吧，下一步是.我们有个问题。好的。

Audience: The percentage of ... If you can go back.
The 5%, 10%, that has manged  to be there [inaudible] ?

观众：百分比.如果你能回去的话。5%，10%，一直在那里[听不见]？

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is, does the 5% and 10% have any ...

问题是，5%和10%的人有没有.

Audience: Like the [inaudible] .

观众：就像[听不见的]。

Kirsty Nathoo: The 5% and 10% is based on the valuation cap in the safe, and so  assuming the priced round valuation is higher than the valuation cap in the safe, then  this is just looked at with reference to the safe, and it's just connected to  the existing shareholders. If in the very rare circumstances that the priced round is lower  than the valuation cap on the safe, then actually, the safe investors will get a  better deal because they will sell their share.
Their safes will convert at the same  price that the series A investors have, which is a lower price than the valuation  cap. So actually there is the potential that this can go up. This percentage can  be higher if the priced round is valued at a lower price than the cap  on the safe.

Nathoo：5%和10%是基于SAFE中的估值上限，所以假设定价周转率高于SAFE中的估值上限，那么这仅仅是参照外管局来看的，它只是与现有的股东联系在一起。如果在非常罕见的情况下，轮价低于外管局的估值上限，那么实际上，安全投资者会得到更好的交易，因为他们会出售自己的股票。他们的SAFE将以与A系列投资者相同的价格转换，这个价格低于估值上限。事实上，这是有可能上升的。这个百分比可以是更高的，如果定价的圆是一个较低的价格低于安全上限。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Kirsty Nathoo: It still triggers the conversion even if the valuation's lower because it's the fact that  they've raised money that triggers the conversion, not the price, so it's just something to  bear in mind that when we talking about this, the post money safes and in  this example, that you're selling 15% of the company, there is potential that it could  be higher, but it's a pretty rare situation where you raise a priced round that's  priced lower than the valuation of your safes. It's also something to bear in mind  of trying not to negotiate too hard on the safes to make your caps too  high because if you raise money on $100 million cap, but then you can only  raise money on a $25 million dollar priced round, let's say, then you're actually selling  more of the company to those safe holders than you expected.

科斯蒂·纳托：即使估值较低，也会引发转换，因为是他们筹集了资金，而不是价格，所以要记住的是，当我们谈到这个问题时，邮政货币SAFE-在这个例子中，你卖出了公司15%的股份，有可能会更高，但这是一种非常罕见的情况，你筹集的价格低于你的SAFE的估价。这也是要记住的一点，就是不要在SAFE上讨价还价太辛苦，让你的帽子太高，因为如果你用1亿美元的盖帽来筹集资金，那么你只能通过2500万美元的价格来筹集资金，比如说，你实际上是在把公司的股份卖给那些持有SAFE的人，比你想象的要多。

Audience: If the founders had convertible debt at this point in time [inaudible]

观众：如果创始人此时有可转换债务[听不见]

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So the question is if there's convertible debt, so this would happen here as  well.
The calculation for convertible debt is slightly different, but it would happen in here  and you would show them just as other investors because they would be converting into  shares in relation to the priced round as well.

好的。所以问题是，如果有可转换债务，那么这也会发生在这里。可转换债券的计算方法略有不同，但它会发生在这里，你会像其他投资者一样向他们展示，因为他们也将转换成相对于定价周期的股票。

Audience: What if you went crazy and actually sold 85% of your company and the valuation  is lower at the end. What happens? Can you share on that?

观众：如果你疯了，真的卖掉了85%的公司，最终的估值更低了，那该怎么办呢？会发生什么？你能分享一下吗？

Kirsty Nathoo: Well, so that's the big question. So the question is what happens if you go  crazy and sell 85% of your company? That's the problem.
The founders can raise too  much money on too low valuation caps when they're raising on convertible instruments.
They don't  realize how much dilution they're taking and then they get to that priced round and  they look at the cap table and they're just like, "What? I only own 10%  of the company now," and unfortunately there's not a huge amount you can do at  that point because you've already entered into the contracts with the investors to do this.  That's why it's important to not get into that situation in the first place.

科斯蒂·纳苏：嗯，这是个大问题。所以问题是，如果你疯狂地卖掉85%的公司股份，会发生什么？这就是问题所在。当创始人在可转换工具上融资时，他们可以过低的估值上限筹集太多的资金。他们没有意识到他们正在接受多少稀释，然后他们得到了这个价格，然后他们看了看盖帽桌，他们就会说，“什么？我现在只拥有公司10%的股份，“不幸的是，在那个时候你不能做很多事情，因为你已经和投资者签订了这样做的合同。这就是为什么从一开始就不要陷入这种状况是很重要的。

Audience: [inaudible]

观众：[听不见]

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how the cap works in relation to the priced rounds. If the  priced round is higher than the cap, then the safe converts at the cap, which  means that the safe holders basically get more shares for the same amount of money  than the series A investors get. In that situation, that's how, you know, what percentage  you're selling. In the situation where the cap is higher than the priced round, it  wouldn't be fair to the safe holders to have them getting a worse deal than  the series A investors, because they put money in earlier. What happens then is that  the calculation, if you remember good, if you go back to the section one of  the safe, where it says what's happens in a priced equity round situation, it says,  if the cap is higher than the priced round, then they just used the priced  round price to calculate their shares, and so because that priced round price is different,  these numbers will go up.

克斯蒂·纳苏：问题是，与定价轮相比，帽子是如何运作的。如果价格高于上限，那么外管局就会在上限上转换，这意味着，相对于A系列投资者而言，相对于A系列投资者，外管局持有的股票基本上会以相同的金额获得更多的股份。在这种情况下，你知道，你卖的百分比是多少。在这种情况下，上限高于定价轮，这将是不公平的安全持有人，让他们得到一个比A系列投资者更糟糕的交易，因为他们投入资金较早。然后是计算，如果你记得很好，如果你回到SAFE的第一节，它说在一个定价的股票周期情况下发生了什么，它说，如果上限高于定价的一轮，那么他们只是用定价的圆周价来计算他们的股票，所以因为那个价格圆周价是不同的，这些数字还会上升。

Audience: But you don't lose much, right? The founders don't lose much?

观众：但你不会失去很多，对吧？创始人的损失不多吗？

Kirsty Nathoo: Well it depends. It depends on the delta. If it's only a little bit different,  then yeah, maybe instead of 15%, they've sold 16% let's say. If the delta is  really big, then it could go up, but again, it's something to be aware of.  It's in the current environment, it's pretty unlikely that people raise priced rounds at lower  valuations than their safes, just because when you're raising money on safes, the investors won't  agree to invest at a ridiculously high valuation because they want to get that bonus  of the lower price when their safes convert. Let's keep going. All right, so this  step you're going to have to trust me on.
The next step in the section  is that the option pool is increased and this is actually quite a complicated calculation.  It gets a little bit circular and I'm going to be sharing a model with  everybody so that you can see how this works if you're interested, but basically what  you're trying to do is to get to 10% of the post money shares, are  sitting available in the option pool. In this example, we're going to increase our option  pool by 1.695 million, and you'll see in a minute that that flows through into  the cap table and you'll see that 10%. But just trust me on this one  because this is quite a complicated calculation.
Then step three, the new money invests. This  is where we have our series A investors putting in $5 million, and there's a  couple of calculations that happen in there.
The price per share, that's calculated for the  round is the valuation divided by the capital capitalization. So this is the pre money  valuation, $15 million. When we talking about capitalization here, what we're meaning is this is  the total fully diluted shares after the safe conversion and the option pool increase. So  that's why this is step three because our safes have converted and our option pool  is increased. We have our 10 million shares that we'd issued, 9.25 to the founders,  725,000 in the options pool, plus the safe conversion shares, plus the increase in the  options pool and you'll see the numbers in a moment. So then the number of  shares that the series A investors get is the amount they're investing divided by their  price per share. So those are the three calculations that you need to remember for  your series A. Here we go. Here are all those calculations. We're saying that the  capitalization, we have our 10 million shares that were already issued. We have our 1.76  million shares from the conversion of the safes, and we have our increased to the  option pool of 1.695 million. So that gives us 13.5 million total shares. We divide  off $15 million, buy those shares to get a new money price. So this is  the price that the investors will pay for their shares of $1.114. So that means  that the $5 million of new money that's coming in, will buy 4.48 million shares  and the lead investor, because they're putting in 4 million, will get 3.59 million of  those shares.
These are the calculations that get worked through. This is what the cap  table, then looks like post money. So this is now everything's been done in the  round. So we've still got our founders, we've still go sour options. Those numbers haven't  changed. This number's changed because it's increased by 1.695 million. You can see here that  now this is 10% of the total shares, which is what we were targeting because  that was agreed in the time sheet. We have our safe investors who the number  of shares haven't changed because we'd already done that calculation for the conversion, but their  percentages have changed. It's gone down a little bit, and the reason why those have  gone down is because the safe investors have been diluted by the series A money  and by the increase in the options pool.
Then we have a lead investor in  our other investors, in our series A. As you remember when we did the quick  back of envelope calculation of the point of guessing the term sheet, our lead investor  owns 20%, our other investors own 5%. So in total they have 25%.
The founders  up here now own 51.5%, which is a big jump from the cap table that  they originally were looking at, where they owned a 92.5%, and that's where this gets  complicated. If you don't understand your dilution, you don't understand how much of the company  that you've sold. When you get to this point and you look at the cap  table and you're saying, "Oh no, I only own 30% of the company, how did  that happen?" There isn't a lot you can do because most of that dilution has  already happened because you've raised money on safes and so that's why it's super important  that you keep track of this dilution because at this point, there isn't a lot  you can do about it. All right. Moving on, so a couple of top tips  for you. We've mentioned briefly about convertible notes and that's just another instrument that you  can use to raise money in the early days. Often we find companies outside of  the US will raise money on convertible debt.
There's nothing wrong with it. It is  a little bit more complex just because you have to deal with interest that accrues  on it and maturity dates, but companies deal with that. What I would say is  try not to have a combination of safes and convertible notes, just because it makes  things a little bit more complicated in the calculations. So if you start raising on  debt, then probably stick with it, but ideally, start with safe because it's actually making  your lives a little bit easier. Again, we're now recommending that companies use post money  safes, but there are pre money safes available and some of you may have already  raised on pre money safes. That's totally fine. It just makes it a little bit  more complicated to understand dilution, but you can still do the same back of envelope  calculation to get a ballpark figure, even though it's not exactly accurate. If you have  raised money on pre money safes, then it's fine to come to in future raise  money on post money safes.
The calculations just gets a little bit complex, but it's  totally doable. So that's fine, don't panic. Would suggest that you probably move on to  post money safes even if you've raised money on pre money safes, just so that  you can keep track of your future dilution. A quick word on optimization in all  of this, when you're raising money on safes, don't try to over optimize for the  cap. It gets really easy to start seeing this as a competition, and you start  talking to your friends and you start saying, "Well, I've raised money on a $6  million cap," and they say, "Well, I've got an $8 million cap and so I'm  more successful than you are." As Jeff mentioned last week, fundraising is not the be  all and end all. It's a means to an end. Don't try to over optimize.  Don't try to push this up too far because you're negotiating with investors who do  this all day and every day and you're probably not somebody who negotiates this all  day and every day. Actually, when I run the numbers on the calculation that we've  just been through, if we'd have changed that 800,000 that was raised on an $8  million cap to a $10 million cap, the ownership at the close, for the founders,  would have been 52.7% rather than 51.5. It's not actually a huge difference, especially if  you have two or three or four founders, co-founders and the extra pain for negotiating  that $2 million cap is probably not worth it. Just take the money, do what  you need to do with the money and made the company a success instead. In  conclusion, use post money safes where you can, hopefully all of you can use those  going forward. Understand what you're selling with the company, so make sure that you keep  track of your dilution, and understand where the company is being sold. Finally, again, don't  over optimize for valuation caps because it doesn't actually make as much difference as you  think it's going to make. So we have a couple of minutes for some more  questions.

基尔斯蒂·纳苏：那得看情况了。这取决于三角洲。如果只是有点不同，那么是的，也许他们卖出了16%，而不是15%。如果三角洲真的很大，那么它可能会上升，但同样，它是值得注意的。在当前的环境下，人们不太可能以比SAFE更低的估值来提高价格，仅仅是因为当你在SAFE上筹集资金时，投资者不会同意以高得离谱的估值投资，因为他们想在SAFE转换后获得更低价格的奖金。我们继续。好吧，这一步你得相信我。本节的下一步是增加选项池，这实际上是一个非常复杂的计算。它有一点循环，我将和大家分享一个模型，这样如果你感兴趣的话，你就可以看到它是如何工作的，但基本上，你要做的是获得10%的贴现款股票，可以在期权池中使用。在这个例子中，我们将把我们的选项池增加169.5万，您将在一分钟内看到流进capd表，您将看到10%。但请相信我，因为这是一个相当复杂的计算。然后第三步，新的资金投入。这就是我们A系列投资者投入500万美元的地方，这里有几个计算结果。每股价格，这一轮的计算是估值除以资本化。因此，这是前货币估值，1500万美元。当我们在这里谈论资本化的时候，我们的意思是，在安全转换和期权池增加之后，全部稀释后的股票。这就是为什么这是第三步，因为我们的SAFE已经转换，我们的选项池也增加了。我们已经发行了1000万股票，9.25股给了创始人，72.5万股在期权池里，再加上安全转换股，再加上期权池的增加，你很快就会看到数字。那么A系列投资者得到的股票数量就是他们投资的数量除以每股价格。这是你需要记住的三种计算。这是所有这些计算。我们说的是资本化，我们已经发行了1000万股票。我们有176万股来自SAFE的转换，我们的期权池增加到169.5万股。因此，我们总共拥有1，350万股票。我们分出1500万美元，购买这些股票以获得一个新的货币价格。这就是投资者为他们1.114美元的股票付出的代价。这就意味着，这500万美元的新资金将购买448万股票，而主要投资者，因为他们投入了400万股，将获得359万股票。这些都是计算出来的。这是什么帽子表，然后看起来像邮政钱。所以现在这一切都是在这一轮中完成的。所以我们仍然有我们的创建者，我们仍然有坏的选择。这些数字没有改变。这个数字改变了，因为它增加了169.5万。你可以在这里看到，现在这是10%的总股票，这是我们的目标，因为这是在时间表上商定的。我们有我们的安全投资者，他们的股票数量没有变化，因为我们已经为转换做了计算，但是他们的百分比已经改变了。它下跌了一点点，而下跌的原因是安全投资者被A系列资金和期权池的增加所稀释。我们还有其他投资者的主要投资者，在我们的A系列中，你们还记得，当我们对项目表进行快速的信封计算时，我们的主要投资者拥有20%的股份，而我们的其他投资者拥有5%的股份。所以他们总共有25%。这里的创始人现在拥有51.5%的股份，这与他们最初看到的帽子表相比有了很大的飞跃，在那里他们拥有92.5%的股份，而这正是事情变得复杂的地方。如果你不理解你的稀释，你就不知道你卖掉了多少公司。当你谈到这一点时，你看着帽子表，你会说：“哦，不，我只拥有公司30%的股份，这是怎么发生的？”你能做的不多，因为大部分的稀释已经发生了，因为你已经为SAFE筹到了钱，所以这就是为什么你跟踪这种稀释是非常重要的，因为在这一点上，你没有什么可以做的。好的继续，给你几个最好的建议。我们简短地提到了可转换票据，这只是你在早期可以用来筹集资金的另一种工具。我们经常发现，美国以外的公司会通过可转换债券筹集资金。这没什么不对的。这有点复杂，因为你必须处理利息和到期日期，但公司处理这一点。我想说的是，尽量不要把SAFE和可转换票据结合起来，因为这会使计算变得更加复杂。因此，如果你开始举债，那么很可能坚持它，但理想的情况下，从安全开始，因为它实际上会让你的生活变得更容易一些。同样，我们现在建议公司使用邮政货币SAFE，但也有预款SAFE可供使用，你们中的一些人可能已经在预款SAFE上筹集了资金。完全没问题。它只是使它有点复杂，了解稀释，但你仍然可以做同样的背面信封计算，以得到一个大概的数字，尽管它不是完全准确的。如果你已经在前钱SAFE上筹到了钱，那就可以在将来用邮政SAFE来筹钱了。计算有点复杂，但完全可行。所以没关系，别慌。这意味着，即使你已经在预款SAFE上筹集了资金，你也可能会继续寄存钱柜，这样你就可以跟踪你未来的稀释情况。在所有这一切中，当你在SAFE上筹集资金时，不要试图对上限进行过度优化。很容易开始把这看作是一场比赛，你开始和你的朋友交谈，你开始说，“嗯，我用600万美元的帽子筹到了钱，”他们说，“嗯，我有一个800万美元的帽子，所以我比你更成功。”正如杰夫上周提到的那样，筹款并不是万事俱备。这是达到目的手段。不要过分优化。不要试图把这件事推得太高，因为你在与那些整天每天都在这样做的投资者谈判，而你可能不是一个整天每天都在谈判的人。实际上，当我计算出我们刚刚完成的数字时，如果我们把80万美元的上限改为1，000万美元的上限，创始人在收尾时的所有权将是52.7%，而不是51.5%。这实际上并没有太大的差别，特别是如果你有两三个或四个创始人，联合创始人，以及谈判200万美元上限的额外痛苦可能是不值得的。拿着钱，做你需要做的事，让公司成功。总之，在你可以使用的地方使用邮政货币SAFE，希望你们所有人都能使用未来的那些。了解你在公司卖什么，所以要确保你跟踪你的稀释，并了解公司在哪里出售。最后，再次强调，不要对估值上限进行过度优化，因为它实际上并没有你认为的那么重要。所以我们还有几分钟的时间来回答更多的问题。

观众：[听不见]。

Kirsty Nathoo: Sorry, repeat is the question, do you care about [inaudible] ?

对不起，重复是个问题，你关心(听不见)吗？

Audience: [inaudible]

观众：[听不见]

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is don't you care more about voting power and that's definitely something that  gets negotiated as part of the series A term sheet. Where the voting power tends  to come from in here is the composition of the board and so generally, you  want to keep the founders having majority of the board and so often at series  A, what you'll find is that this ... If there's two founders in the company,  you'll have two founders on the board and you'll have a representative of the lead  investor on the board.
The founders still have the majority and that's really where the  voting power comes from.

Nathoo：问题是，你不关心更多的投票权，这肯定是作为A系列学期表的一部分而进行的谈判。这里的投票权往往来自董事会的组成，所以一般来说，你想让创始人拥有董事会的多数席位，而且经常是在A系列中，你会发现.如果公司里有两位创始人，你将在董事会中有一位首席投资者的代表。创始人仍然拥有多数，这才是真正的投票权来源。

Audience: How important is to find the lead investor and how should one approach [inaudible] ?

观众：找到主要投资者有多重要？一种方法(听不见的)应该怎么做？

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how important is a lead investor? When you're raising money on safes,  you don't necessarily need a lead investor.
The beauty of the safes is that as  soon as somebody agrees to invest in your company, you can say, "Great, here's the  safe, sign it, and give me my money." Even if that's only a small amount  of money, that doesn't matter as long as you've negotiated how much they're putting in,  and what the valuation cap is. So for safes, it doesn't matter at all that  you don't have a lead investor. At the priced round stage, it is important that  you have a lead investor because there's so much to negotiate that you don't want  to be negotiating with a bunch of people. You want to negotiate with one pers  ... Oh, well one investor who is, is setting out the terms because they're putting  in, in this example, $4 million after the five, and then everyone else gets pulled  along with those same terms.

柯斯蒂·纳苏：问题是，牵头投资者有多重要？当你在SAFE上筹集资金时，你不一定需要一个首席投资者。保险箱的美妙之处在于，一旦有人同意投资你的公司，你就可以说：“太好了，这是保险箱，签了名，把钱给我。”即使这只是一小笔钱，只要你已经协商了他们投入了多少，以及估值上限是多少，那就无关紧要了。所以对于SAFE来说，没有主要投资者并不重要。在定价轮的阶段，重要的是你有一个主要的投资者，因为有太多的谈判，你不想与一群人谈判。你想和一个人谈判.。哦，有一位投资者正在制定条款，因为在这个例子中，他们在五人之后投入了400万美元，然后其他所有人都得到了同样的条件。

Audience: What is the maximum amount that you should give up [inaudible]

观众：你应该放弃的最大金额是多少？

Kirsty Nathoo: Great question.
The question was, what's the maximum amount that you should give up for  in a seed round or a safe round? If we just quickly go back to  this. This is actually a fairly standard cap table that we'd expect to see, where  the founders own just over 50%. We see that in the vast majority of cases  coming out of a series A priced round. If you think about it, these numbers  are set. Generally, in pretty much any series A around, the lead investor is going  to want around 20%, and the total amount sold of the company is going to  be around 25%.
The option pool is going to be around 10% post money, so  that's already 35%. So then really all you have to play with is what the  safe investors get to drive what the founder's own. So the more you sell to  the safe investors, the less the founders are going to own. In this example where  we were selling 15% of the company, that's probably about the range that you want  to be looking at. Obviously every company has a different circumstance, and getting some money  in less good terms is better than getting no money in it at all.
There's  always discretion that has to be made, but yeah, this is a fairly standard cap  table about 15% on safes, about 25 to the lead ... To the series A  investors, and about 10% options pool with the rest of the founders. One more question  and then we've probably got to wrap up. So let's go the back over there.

问得好。问题是，在种子轮或安全轮中，你应该放弃的最大数量是多少？如果我们能快点回到这个问题上。这实际上是一个相当标准的上限表，我们期待看到，其中创始人拥有略高于50%。我们看到，在绝大多数情况下，从A系列的价格轮。如果你想一想，这些数字就设定好了。一般来说，在几乎所有的A系列中，主要投资者会想要20%左右，而公司的总销售量将在25%左右。期权池将在10%左右的邮政资金，所以这已经是35%。所以，你所要做的就是让安全的投资者去驱动创建者自己的东西。所以你卖给安全投资者的越多，创始人就会拥有的越少。在这个例子中，我们出售了公司15%的股份，这可能是你想要看到的范围。显然，每一家公司都有不同的情况，以不太好的条件得到一些钱总比没有钱好。总要谨慎行事，但是的，这是一个相当标准的上限表-保险箱约15%，领先25%.。对于A系列的投资者来说，大约10%的期权都是和其他的创始人们在一起的。再问一个问题，我们就得结束了。我们到后面去。

Audience: [inaudible] .

观众：[听不见]。

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So it's two things there. First thing is what happens if the founders are  putting in money themselves? The second thing is should they put in safes; not safe  notes because that makes me grouchy, because safes aren't debt, so you don't call them  notes. That's one of the things to bear in mind.
They're just safes.
The other  question was around the founders; there's different ways you can do that. If founders are  putting in money, they can just loan the company money, and so then, if they're  putting in $25,000 and then they raise a million dollars from the safe investors, they  could repay the founders or there are situations where the founders would put that money  in on a safe and so they potentially get some or they would in that  situation, get some series A preferred shares when the safes converts. So you can do  either way. All right. I think we finished on time, so that's good news. Thank  you very much for listening. I know this stuff's difficult.


好的。这里有两件事。第一件事是，如果创始人自己投入资金，会发生什么？第二件事是他们是否应该放SAFE，而不是安全钞票，因为这让我很不高兴，因为SAFE不是债务，所以你不叫它们钞票。这是要记住的事情之一。他们只是保险箱。另一个问题围绕着创始人，你有不同的方法可以做到这一点。如果创始人投入资金，他们可以把公司的钱借给他们，然后，如果他们投入2.5万美元，然后从安全投资者那里筹集到100万美元，他们就可以偿还创始人，或者在某些情况下，创始人会把这些钱放在SAFE上，这样他们就有可能得到一些，或者在这种情况下他们会得到一些，得到一些系列A优先股时，保险箱转换。所以你可以做任何一种方式。好的我想我们准时完成了，所以这是个好消息。非常感谢你的聆听。我知道这很难。
