# A Conversation on Hard Tech with Eric Migicovsky


- Welcome. We have Eric here today, so Eric is a YC partner. He was previously the CEO and founder of Pebble, which went through the YC batch, in all the way winter of 2011.

-欢迎我们今天有埃里克，所以埃里克是YC的合伙人。他以前是Pe球公司的首席执行官和创始人，该公司经历了YC批次，直到2011年冬天。

- A long, long time ago.

-很久以前

-You're an old man, Eric.

你是个老人埃里克

- It was back in, so now we have the other building on the other side, but my YC batch was one of the last ones in the small building.

- Yeah. You actually, it was called Alerta when you applied.

-是啊实际上，你申请的时候叫做Alerta。

- Yep, and our product was called Impulse.

-是的，我们的产品叫做Impulse.

- Impulse.

-脉冲

- Yes, we had a whole bunch of complicated names.

-是的，我们有一大堆复杂的名字

-How did you...? I mean Pebble's a great name. How did you end up on that?

-你是怎么.？我是说鹅卵石是个好名字。你是怎么结束的？

- How did we get to a much better name?

-我们是怎么得到一个更好的名字的？

- Yeah

-是啊

- You go through a lot of worse names on the way. I think the original names were found using a thesaurus or some sort of, like we just scanned through a book for words that were related to alerting, Alerta. That was how we got to it.

-你在路上经历了很多更糟糕的名字我认为最初的名字是用辞典或者其他什么方法找到的，就像我们刚刚在一本书中扫描了一本与提醒有关的单词，Alerta。我们就是这么做到的。

- Yeah.

-是啊

- Originally. Pebble was a much better name. I actually thought of it while lying on a beach and it was like two years before we actually made Pebble. I just like wrote it down in Evernote, on a list of good names.

-最初。鹅卵石是个更好的名字。当我躺在沙滩上的时候，我真的想到了，就在两年前，我们才开始制作鹅卵石。我只是喜欢把它写在Evernote上，写在一个好名字的列表上。

- Nice

-不错

- You have no idea when you're gonna use another name, so if you get any good ones, just write 'em down.

-你不知道什么时候用别的名字，所以如果你有好名字，就把它们写下来.

-So today, I wanna spend a little time talking about hardware startups, given you ran one, especially one that was one of the larger hardware startups in the past few years, but then spend the bulk of the time talking about hard tech. Because you spend a lot of time working with hard tech, or deep tech, whatever we wanna call it.

-所以今天，我想花点时间讨论硬件创业，考虑到你经营了一家，尤其是过去几年中规模较大的硬件初创企业之一，但接下来的大部分时间都在谈论硬科技。因为你花了很多时间在高科技或者深科技上工作，不管我们怎么称呼它。

- Here at YC.

-在YC.

- Here at YC.
And there are a lot of unknowns still out there, and we obviously want to fund more of those kind of startups. So starting with Pebble, so can you take us through the quick story of when you came to YC how big were you? What did you do in YC? Like, that's actually a common question of what hardware startups actually do at YC in a few months.

-在YC.还有很多未知数，我们显然想资助更多这样的初创公司。所以从鹅卵石开始，你能告诉我们你来YC的时候有多大吗？你在YC做了什么？比如，这实际上是一个常见的问题，那就是几个月后，YC的硬件初创公司到底会做些什么。

- So we applied to YC, started the company in 2008. Started working on it while I was still a student at Waterloo. Kept working on it through 2010. We hadn't actually shipped, or we were just starting to ship the product to first customers, this is before Pebble, back in mid 2010, and I'd been on Hacker News forever, but I had never really understood what Y Combinator was. I just thought it was like a domain name for Hacker News, and one day someone said, hey, you should check out YC, and so just on a whim, we applied.
The video we recorded, if I look back at it, was during Octoberfest in Kitchener, Waterloo, where I was living, and we were wearing Octoberfest hats in the video. We applied. For some crazy reason, Paul Graham, Jessica, and the gang decided to accept us, even though I think we were the third hardware company that got through. We started YC in 2011, in the winter, and the company, the stage of the company was we had shipped maybe, I think, 2 or 300 of our very first watch, the watch that was called the Impulse that worked with Blackberry smart phones, and we had some early customers. We were getting money, or we were earning some money. Hadn't raised much. I think I borrowed 15,000 bucks from my parents, got some government grants in Canada, which was quite easy, but we hadn't raised any money from investors. YC was the first investor.

-所以我们向YC申请，在2008年创办了这家公司。我还是滑铁卢学生的时候就开始研究了。一直工作到2010年。我们还没有真正出品，或者我们刚刚开始向第一批客户发货，这是早在2010年年中，我就一直在Hacker News上，但我从来没有真正理解Y Combinator是什么。我以为这就像黑客新闻的域名，有一天有人说，嘿，你应该看看YC，所以只是一时兴起，我们申请了。我们录制的视频，如果我回头看的话，是在10月在滑铁卢的基奇纳(Kitchener，Waterloo)举行的，当时我住在那里，我们在视频中戴着十八个节日的帽子。我们申请了。出于某种疯狂的原因，保罗·格雷厄姆、杰西卡和那帮人决定接受我们，尽管我认为我们是第三家通过的硬件公司。我们在2011年的冬天创立了YC公司，公司的发展阶段是，我认为，我们的第一款手表可能已经发运了2到300款手表，这款名为Impulse的手表与黑莓智能手机合作，我们也有一些早期客户。我们得到了钱，或者我们赚了些钱。没有筹到多少钱。我想我从我父母那里借了15，000美元，在加拿大得到了一些政府赠款，这很容易，但我们没有从投资者那里筹集到任何资金。YC是第一个投资者。

- So 15,000 dollars let you manufacture you said the first 100 units?

-那么15，000美元让你制造你说的前100台？

- We ended up making them one by one, actually, so the first watches, for this first watch, they were manufactured, we bought the circuit boards from China. We had the metal, the kind of metal casing of the watch made at a small metal shop. A guy had a 5 axis CNC printer, or a mill, and he actually just like, he read about us in the school newspaper, or something like that, and offered to be our first shop for making the actual metal cases, so metal case would get made, just a couple blocks away. We'd get the circuit boards shipped in from China. We also made the plastic watch straps in China, and then we would do the final assembly one by one in the garage, and I think that early process of making everything one by one was perfect for us, because we screwed up everything you could possibly screw up in the first 10 watches. We had a lot of problems, but we had a problem with our app. We couldn't get the signal out of the watch, because it's like a Faraday cage sitting on your wrist, and so we said, well maybe let's change the metal back for a plastic back, and so we had a whole bunch of laser cut acrylic sheet plastic cut to the same size as the back of the watch and we kind of jammed it in, and then we shipped the first 10 of them out by FedEx, and on something like 7 out of the 10 the electronics just exploded out the back of the plastic, and people would show us pictures of this watch that they just bought with the guts just everywhere, and so we adjusted the thing. We started putting a piece of foam rubber inside the watch, so when we shipped it, the backs wouldn't explode. But it was a really good thing that we were making them one by one or else we could have potentially made hundreds with that same problem, right? At the beginning, and had lost basically everything, so we, I think we iterated really quickly and when we screwed up it was only a maximum of like a pretty small screw up.

-我们最终是一个接一个地做的，实际上，所以第一批手表，这第一只手表，是制造出来的，我们从中国买了电路板。我们有金属，那种金属外壳的手表在一家小型金属商店制造。一个人有一台5轴的数控打印机，或者一台磨坊，他实际上就像，他在校报上看到了我们，或者诸如此类的东西，他主动提出要成为我们第一家生产实际金属盒的商店，这样金属盒就可以在几个街区以外的地方制造。从中国运来的电路板。我们还在中国制造了塑料表带，然后我们会在车库里一个接一个地组装，我认为一个接一个地制造所有东西的早期过程对我们来说是完美的，因为我们把所有你可能在前10块表中可能搞砸的东西都搞砸了。我们有很多问题，但我们的应用程序有问题。我们无法从手表上得到信号，因为它就像一个法拉第笼子坐在你的手腕上，所以我们说，也许让我们把金属背换成塑料背，然后我们把一整束激光切割的丙烯酸塑料切割成和手表背面一样大的尺寸，然后我们就把它塞进去了。然后我们用联邦快递(FedEx)把它们中的前10个发了出去，在大约10个中的7个上，电子产品从塑料的背面爆炸了，人们会给我们看这只手表的照片，他们只是随时随地用肠子买的，所以我们调整了它。我们开始在手表里放一块泡沫橡胶，所以当我们把它运出去时，它的背不会爆炸。但这是一件很好的事情，我们是一个接一个的，否则，我们可以通过同样的问题潜在地制造数百人，对吗？在开始的时候，基本上已经失去了一切，所以我们，我认为我们迭代得非常快，当我们搞砸的时候，它只是一个非常小的错误。

- Got it.
And how many units had you sold before you actually went through the entire manufacturing process?

-明白了在你完成整个生产过程之前，你卖出了多少台？

- We continued to manufacture one by one by hand up until around 700, 800 units.

-我们继续手工生产，直至约700，800辆。

- Wow.

-哇

- So even when, so one of the things that people ask often about YC is like well what happens if I have to move my business to Mountain View? It's gonna interrupt my production process or whatever, so what we did was I hired a couple high school students and I asked one of my friends who I went to school with, who was doing his master's back at Waterloo to just kind of like manage and run the production thing, and they would ship 'em down here and we would finish it in our house that we were all living at, and so I think the trick there was we didn't let the fact that we had to be here in Mountain View interrupt our actual sales process.

因此，即使是在什么时候，人们经常问YC的事情之一是，如果我不得不把我的生意搬到山景城，那会发生什么呢？它会打断我的制作过程，所以我们就雇了几个高中生，我问我的一个朋友，他在滑铁卢做他的主人的背，就像管理和经营生产一样，他们会把它们运到这里，我们会在我们住的房子里完成它，所以我认为我们的诀窍是，我们没有让我们必须在山景城的事实干扰我们的实际销售过程。

- And so after YC, Pebble obviously took off, and lots of great things happened. What were the, I mean you went through lots of ups and downs.

-所以在YC之后，鹅卵石明显地起飞了，许多伟大的事情发生了。我的意思是，你经历了很多起起落落。

- It was a year after YC. It wasn't like immediately after. It took a long time.

-是在YC一年之后之后就不一样了。花了很长时间。

- Yeah, so what was the hardest part, maybe? Out of your whole journey with Pebble?

-是的，那么最难的部分是什么，也许？从你和鹅卵石的旅程中走出来？

- Looking back, I think it's different, because, you know, seeing it forward, it actually took us a long time to get from the initial idea to any sort of real product/market fit. It was five years. So we started the company in 2008, built the initial prototype late 2008, 2009, didn't start shipping until 2010, and that was for our first watch, and then we had a lot of lessons learned from that first production run, and then we redesigned and created what would become Pebble in 2012. So that's five years, and the hardest thing, like I would say we've worked with a lot of founders, and the hardest question that I think I ever get as someone who helps startups is how do I know that what I'm working on is the right thing to work on? How do I know that this little pivot that I could do is not the right one? Like, maybe I should try that.
And there's no answer to this. It is the hardest problem.
And so I, thinking back, I think it was probably very misguided in that I just had faith, and I just never gave up, even though now thinking back it's insane doing something for five years. Like what's the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing, and hoping for different results? Like I was basically doing that for five years, like we were just, I guess we didn't know what we didn't know. Like we were very naive, and we had a very small amount of money, and we didn't know that you're not supposed to make consumer hardware products on a budget of 40,000 dollars. Like most electronics that you use are made with budgets of millions of dollars.

-回顾过去，我认为这是不同的，因为，你知道，展望未来，我们花了很长时间才从最初的想法到任何形式的真正的产品/市场适合。那是五年。所以我们在2008年创立了公司，在2008年底，2009年建造了最初的原型，直到2010年才开始发货，这是我们的第一只手表，然后我们从第一次生产中学到了很多经验，然后我们重新设计并创建了将在2012年成为鹅卵石的产品。这是五年，也是最艰难的事情，就像我要说的，我们和很多创始人一起工作过，而作为一个帮助初创企业的人，我遇到的最棘手的问题是，我如何知道我正在做的事情是正确的？我怎么知道我能做的这个小支点不是正确的呢？也许我该试试。这件事没有答案。这是最难的问题。所以我，回想起来，我认为这可能是非常误导，因为我只是有信心，我只是从来没有放弃，即使现在回想起来，这是疯狂的做了五年的事情。精神错乱的定义是什么？做同样的事情，希望得到不同的结果？好像我已经做了五年了，就像我们只是，我想我们不知道什么。就像我们很天真，我们有一小部分钱，我们不知道你不应该用4万美元的预算来制造消费硬件产品。和大多数电子产品一样，你使用的电子产品都是用数百万美元的预算制作的。

- I mean, but now that you've done it, or you did do it, do you think it's possible now?

-我是说，但现在你已经做了，或者你做了，你认为现在有可能吗？

- Oh, it's totally possible. No, what I'm saying is I think like the hardest part that we had to go through was not letting other people get us down, and kind of like maintaining that naiveté. One of the things that I really love about that phase of the startup was people couldn't really convince us that what we were doing was wrong, because no one had really done it before, and if people said, like, oh, you should look at raising more money or something like that, we didn't really have the resources to do that. Like we were a very constrained, naive team, and so we had to figure it out, and I think some of the ways that I could have screwed it up was actually the ways that I did screw it up was right after YC, we raised a bit of money, about 250,000 dollars, including this large check that we got from one investor, and I took all that money and invested it in inventory, because I thought at the time the biggest constraint on us growing was we didn't have a reliable, like we didn't have a large amount of inventory. We were making them by hand. So we only had like 10 or 50 a week.
And I was under the mistaken impression that if we could start selling it in real time rather than saying we'll do a pre order and sell it to you in a couple weeks, that our sales would have taken off more, because then we tried this. We manufactured, instead of making them by hand, in our garage, we went to a small contract manufacturer in San Jose and manufactured 3,000 at once, and spent all of our money on that, and you can all see where this story is going, it takes longer than you expect to bring up a new manufacturer, so it took six months or eight months instead of three months. It cost more than we expected, so the BOM cost rose, and then by the time we actually manufactured them, that eight months rolled around, our email list of potential customers had kind of dried up. Everyone had switched from Blackberry to using iPhones, and then we were stuck with a whole bunch of inventory, so yeah, that was a really rough, difficult part.

-哦，完全有可能不，我的意思是，我认为我们必须经历的最困难的部分就是不要让别人让我们失望，就像保持那种天真。我最喜欢创业的那个阶段的事情之一就是人们不能让我们相信我们所做的是错误的，因为以前没有人真的这么做过，如果人们说，哦，你应该考虑筹集更多的钱或者类似的东西，我们没有足够的资源去做这件事。就像我们是一个很拘束、天真的团队，所以我们必须弄清楚，我可能会搞砸的一些方法实际上是我把它搞砸的方式是在YC之后，我们筹集了一些钱，大约25万美元，包括我们从一个投资者那里得到的一张大支票，我把所有的钱都投入到库存中，因为当时我认为，对我们增长的最大限制是，我们没有可靠的东西，就像我们没有大量的存货一样。我们是手工做的。所以我们一周只有10到50英镑。我有一种错误的印象，如果我们能开始实时销售，而不是说我们会在几周内做一个预购，然后卖给你，我们的销售就会涨得更多，因为然后我们尝试了这个。我们在我们的车库里制造，而不是手工制造，我们去了圣何塞的一家小型合同制造商，一次制造了3，000件，花了我们所有的钱，你可以看到这个故事的发展方向，它比你想象的要花更长的时间，所以它花了6个月或8个月，而不是3个月。它的成本比我们预期的要高，所以BOM的成本上升了，然后当我们实际生产BOM的时候，八个月的时间里，我们的潜在客户的电子邮件列表已经干涸了。每个人都从黑莓转到使用iPhone，然后我们陷入了大量的库存，所以是的，这是一个非常粗糙，困难的部分。

- Yeah, it's often, not always, but in many cases people get really creative when they don't have much money, and they have to get really scrappy, and then when they raise a ton of money, they forget how to do that.

-是的，这通常是，但在很多情况下，当他们没有很多钱的时候，人们会变得很有创造力，他们必须变得非常暴躁，然后当他们筹集到一大笔钱时，他们就会忘记如何去做。

- And it happened to me again, like three years later. Like we raised a bunch of money and then started hiring, and this is a big problem, that even mostly the successful companies run into, and so I think the moral of the story for me at least is how I think about projects that I work on, is like, that frugality is vital to me. Not everyone has the same, and not every industry is exactly the same.
There's a few crazy industries right now which are kind of by definition the opposite of frugal. I'm thinking of the scooter share companies, where it's a matter of raising as much money as physically possible, but for the vast majority of people, like staying frugal is what actually...

-这又发生在我身上，大概三年后.就像我们筹集了一大笔钱，然后开始招聘，这是一个很大的问题，即使是成功的公司也会遇到，所以我认为至少对我来说，这个故事的寓意是我如何看待我所从事的项目，比如，节俭对我来说是至关重要的。并不是每个人都一样，也不是每个行业都是一样的。现在有一些疯狂的行业，从定义上来说，它们与节俭相反。我想到的是滑板车股份公司，在那里，筹集尽可能多的资金是一个问题，但对于绝大多数人来说，像节俭才是真正的问题。

- Yeah, if you don't have network, like obvious network effects, or first mover advantage, then usually you should go down the other path. So Pebble is known as one of the most, you did one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter, and so a lot of people view crowdfunding as a way in lieu of fundraising, to do that route. So I think there are a lot of questions on when is the right time to do it, especially like at what point do I need a product that is real and works? Do I need to align that with the crowdfunding campaign? And so forth, so what's your advice on that?

-是的，如果你没有网络，比如明显的网络效应，或者是先发优势，那么通常你应该走另一条路。所以鹅卵石被认为是最成功的之一，你在Kickstarter上做了最成功的众筹活动之一，所以很多人认为众筹是代替筹款的一种方式。因此，我认为有很多问题，什么时候是正确的时间去做，特别是在什么时候，我需要一个产品是真实的和有效的？我是否需要与众筹运动保持一致？等等，你对此有什么建议？

- I have a, after having gone through a couple of these cycles, here's my advice. I think crowdfunding can be useful for two specific points. Mainly useful for two specific points in a startup's life. You could use crowdfunding at the very early stage, when you have an idea on the back of a napkin, maybe a render or two, to raise 25, 50,000 dollars that can help you get to a working prototype. This is for people who are software engineers, and are experimenting or want to work with hardware. This is for hardware engineers who have zero money and they just wanna prove that some people want their product. So I wanna be very specific. This is an intention play. It's not trying to build like a multi million dollar campaign with super fancy CGI graphics, and overproduced videos. I'm talking about people honestly saying I just need a little bit of money to get this idea off the ground.
And I think there's an opportunity to use crowdfunding right there. It can be as simple as just emailing a bunch of your friends and saying, hey, do you wanna just, do you want one of these? This is like the best test that you can have for early product/market fit, is do your friends and family actually wanna pay you money for what you're making? Or do early customers actually wanna pre pay for what you're making? It's not perfect, because, you know, they may wanna try it first or something like that, but if you are making something that people really want, they're basically throwing their money at you, so that's an opportunity for this early crowdfunding. I really encourage people to not try to do the marketing blowout campaign at the start for two reasons. One is just looking back, most of those campaigns, even if they do succeed at raising money, usually fail to produce and actually ship their product, and I think the reason why is going through the cycle of having to make something and ship it to customers is really educational, and you also learn what people like about your product, and what they don't like, as quickly as, like you reduce the amount of time between you having the idea and you getting validation of do people actually want this idea? So that's the first I think opportunity for crowdfunding. I think there's actually another opportunity using it more as like a marketing and sales channel, which is I think more of what we did, where we had already made, most people don't know this, but when we launched our Kickstarter campaign, we had already made and sold around 1,500 of our first watch, and so we had gone through all the pain and the cycle of building that, and we had a really good idea of what Pebble should look like, because we had feedback from about 1,500 individuals who were like super eager early adopters, very open with their feedback, and we tuned and tweaked the product, so I think there's kind of like two separate crowdfunding opportunities in a consumer product's life cycle. I think too often people blend them together, or they don't know which path they're on, and so they kind of screw it up.
They, there's actually a couple other platforms for this early crowdfunding.
There's Kickstarter and Indiegogo and that kind of thing, but there's also There's Crowd Supply.
There's like Hack a Day forums.
There's a lot of really niche areas where you could, you could go to a Discord server and say, like, who wants to buy? You don't have to use the big Kickstarter platforms for that early phase.

-我有一个，在经历了几个这样的循环之后，下面是我的建议。我认为众筹对两点是有用的。在初创公司的生命中，主要有两点是有用的。在早期阶段，你可以利用众筹，当你在餐巾纸的背面有一个想法，也许一两个，筹集25000美元，可以帮助你得到一个工作的原型。这是为软件工程师，并正在试验或希望与硬件工作的人。这是给没有钱的硬件工程师的，他们只是想证明一些人想要他们的产品。所以我想说得很具体。这是一个意图游戏。它并没有试图建立像数百万美元的超级花哨的CGI图形和过度制作的视频。我说的是人们，诚实地说，我只是需要一点钱来实现这个想法。我认为这是一个利用众筹的机会。这很简单，就像给你的一群朋友发邮件说，嘿，你想要这些吗？这就像你在早期产品/市场上所能做的最好的测试，你的朋友和家人真的想为你的收入付钱吗？还是早期客户真的想为你赚的钱预付费？这并不完美，因为，你知道，他们可能想先试一试，或者诸如此类的东西，但如果你想要的是人们真正想要的东西，他们基本上是把钱投给你，所以这是一个机会，为这个早期的众筹。我真的鼓励人们不要在一开始就尝试做营销井喷运动，原因有二。一是回顾一下，大多数这些活动，即使他们确实成功地筹集了资金，通常也不能生产和实际运输他们的产品，我认为，为什么要制造一些东西并把它运送给客户的原因是很有教育意义的，而且你也了解到人们对你的产品有什么喜欢和不喜欢什么，就像你缩短了你的想法和你得到验证之间的时间一样，人们真的想要这个想法吗？所以我认为这是第一次获得众筹的机会。我认为实际上还有另一个机会，更像是一个营销和销售渠道，我认为我们做了更多的事情，在我们已经做过的事情上，大多数人都不知道，但是当我们发起我们的Kickstarter运动时，我们已经制作和销售了大约1500块我们的第一只手表，所以我们经历了所有的痛苦和构建的循环，我们很好地了解了鹅卵石应该是什么样子，因为我们得到了大约1500个人的反馈，他们是非常热心的早期采用者，他们的反馈非常开放，我们对产品进行了调整和调整。因此，我认为，在消费产品的生命周期中，有两种独立的众筹机会。我觉得人们经常把它们混在一起，或者他们不知道自己走的是哪条路，所以他们搞砸了。他们，实际上还有另外几个平台来支持这个早期的众筹。有Kickstarter和Indiegogo之类的东西，但也有人群供应。就像黑客日间的论坛。有很多真正的利基领域你可以，你可以去一个不和谐的服务器，然后问，比如，谁想买？在早期阶段，您不必使用大型Kickstarter平台。

- Do you suggest having a date in which I can promise you I can actually deliver this? 'Cause if I'm using Kickstarter with the first route, maybe I don't know that I can deliver within six months. Is there like a certain time period in which I know I can deliver then I do that?

-你建议我和你约会吗？我可以向你保证我能把这个送出去吗？因为如果我在第一条路线上使用Kickstarter，也许我不知道我是否能在六个月内交付。是否有一个特定的时间段，我知道我可以交付，那么我就这样做了吗？

- Yeah, and if you're not, like I would encourage, if you're not confident in your ability to ship it, then don't use one of these crowdfunding platforms where it's very shipping centric.
There's other options.
And again, I really do encourage going through that first cycle to find out things like, how long does it take me to make things? Do I have all the skills on my team? Or do I actually have to find people potentially in the community, to help contribute software? Or other skills to the team? Again, too many people I see they skip that step and they try to go directly to the high powered marketing campaign, and it's just such a sad time most of the time.

-是的，如果你没有，就像我鼓励的那样，如果你对你的运输能力没有信心，那就不要使用那些以航运为中心的众筹平台。还有其他选择。再一次，我真的鼓励通过第一个周期来找出一些东西，比如，我要花多长时间才能做东西？我的团队有所有的技能吗？或者，我真的需要在社区中找到潜在的人，来帮助贡献软件吗？或者团队的其他技能？再一次，我看到太多的人，他们跳过了这一步，他们试图直接去做高强度的营销活动，而大多数时候，这只是一个悲伤的时刻。

- Yeah, and sometimes there's like a group, you're trying to go after the group before the early adopters, 'cause on Kickstarter, those are kind of early adopters.

-是的，有时候就像一个团体，你试图在早期采用者之前追踪这个群体，因为在Kickstarter上，那些是早期采用者。

- Yeah.

-是啊

- But there's a group before that.

-但在那之前有一群人

- Exactly, exactly, and I think for your given industry and for your given product category, you should be able to find it. Like sometimes it's as simple as going on a sub Reddit. Like we've had some great companies come through YC, and they do their initial sales just by earning credibility in a Facebook group, or they earn credibility in a Reddit group, or Discord, like there's a ton of customers there.

-对，我认为，对于你的特定行业和特定的产品类别，你应该能够找到它。就像有时候就像在Reddit上一样简单。就像我们有一些伟大的公司通过YC，他们的初始销售仅仅是通过在Facebook集团中获得信誉，或者他们在Reddit集团中获得信誉，或者是不和谐，就像那里有很多客户一样。

- Cool. So when you talked about Pebble earlier, you talked about hiring people and outsourcing things. What's the right call in terms of outsourcing the various components?

-酷所以，当你早些时候谈论鹅卵石的时候，你谈到了雇佣人员和外包的事情。从外包各种组件的角度来看，什么才是正确的选择？

- So this is a really hard question for hard tech companies, because more often than not, the skill sets that you'll need to build your products are actually quite varied. You may need a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, a computer engineer, some production people, office people, and you don't necessarily need 100% of that person all the time. You need like 15% or 20% for three weeks, and then you're back to not needing an electrical engineer, so the best way to solve this is to have really flexible technical people on your team, where you guys can just kind of incorporate everything and just do it yourself, because those teams move so much faster than teams that require an external process. Some of the most painful moments of my early career were not having full time cofounders, and having to work with contractors or consultants who honestly like, you can't pay someone enough to care. I mean, firstly because you probably don't have that much money, but also because people who are working on contract, they're just set up to not have the same motivations, the same alignments as someone who's working 24/7 trying to get their fledgling startup off the ground has. You run into time commitments. I just had an email the other day from a founder who's like, yeah, our intern went back to school.
And he was developing a large portion of our company.

对高科技公司来说，这是一个非常棘手的问题，因为通常情况下，构建产品所需的技能是多种多样的。你可能需要一个机械工程师，一个电气工程师，一个计算机工程师，一些生产人员，办公室人员，而且你不一定一直都需要100%的人。你需要15%或20%的三周时间，然后你又回到了不需要电气工程师的状态，所以解决这个问题的最好方法是在你的团队中有真正灵活的技术人员，在那里你们可以把所有事情都整合起来，自己做，因为这些团队的移动速度比需要外部流程的团队要快得多。我早期职业生涯中的一些最痛苦的时刻是没有全职的联合创始人，必须与承包商或顾问一起工作，而这些人真的很喜欢，你不能给一个人足够的报酬来照顾他。我的意思是，首先，因为你可能没有那么多的钱，但也因为那些在合同上工作的人，他们被设定为没有相同的动机，和那些每天24小时都在努力让他们的初创公司起步的人一样。你会遇到时间上的承诺。前几天我收到了一封来自创办人的电子邮件，他说，是的，我们的实习生回到了学校。他正在开发我们公司的大部分股份。

- Oh

-噢

- And so yeah, so like I actually opt for in the early days, and pretty much all days, trust and dependability and kind of smartness over very specific deep domain specific knowledge in who I'm looking to hire.

-所以是的，就像我在最初的日子里选择的那样，几乎所有的日子里，信任和可靠，以及一种智慧，在我想要雇佣的人这一特定领域的特定知识上，都是很聪明的。

- So last question on hardware specifically, there's this common saying or adage or whatever you wanna call it that's like, hardware, you can't just build hardware. You have to have a software component so that it scales, so you can have a subscription service on top of it, instead of just the one off type purchase. How much do you believe in that? Or what do you think about people who say that all the time?

最后一个关于硬件的问题你必须有一个软件组件，这样它才能扩展，这样你就可以在上面有一个订阅服务，而不仅仅是一次性的购买。你对此有多相信？或者你对那些一直这么说的人有什么看法？

- So I've been working on, I've been doing a bit of research into this category. This really got me interested right after Pebble, because that was some feedback that we often got. Could you launch a subscription service? Could you have some sort of payment subscription? And you've heard of product/market fit, right? The idea that customers really in a particular market are going after your product. I actually think there's something called business model/company fit, where you could have the best product on the world. You could actually have product/market fit, but if you have the wrong business model, you're not gonna be able to fund and grow your company over the long term. So it's kind of like an advanced thing, like you don't need to worry about this if you don't have product/market fit because if you don't have product/market fit, you don't have a company. But we ran into a problem pretty soon after we hit product/market fit, misunderstanding what was the business model that was gonna drive this company? And I think there's actually seven or eight or nine different business models that are lanes that hardware companies or hard tech companies can use. I've been working on just researching and putting companies into different categories and you have the subscription companies, like the Nests or the Dropcams of the world that are selling, Ring, healthy 3 to 10 dollar subscriptions per month, but then you see other companies that try to do something similar, and it just does not work, and I think that's because, so in our case we didn't struggle I think with subscriptions. We experimented with it. It wasn't really gonna work for us, but the way that we screwed it up was we didn't understand that we were in a hits driven market. Hits driven being you come out with a consumer product, hopefully it's a hit. It hits that product/market fit, and people start pulling it out of your hands. Similar to a game company, we didn't realize that we had to be super frugal, super low budget as we developed the new products and kind of tried to engineer another hit. Our first product was certainly a hit. I don't think we ever reached escape velocity to a hit with any of our later products, and I think if we had built a more frugal organization. If we were able to build products cheaper, and then launch them and test to see if they were successful, and if they were successful, scale it up, et cetera, I think we might have had a slightly different outcome. I mean, it kind of goes back to like there are these different models for hardware companies, and you need to make sure that you are on the right one. You have to question yourself, and be like, should we really be on a subscription model? Is this really what customers are gonna want? Would they want to spend 5 dollars, 10 dollars a month, and you can't force it.
And if you force it, like I think we tried to do, you might add extra problems like on top of just building great products for your customers.

-所以我一直在研究，我一直在做一些关于这个类别的研究。这真的让我对鹅卵石感兴趣，因为这是我们经常得到的反馈。你能推出订阅服务吗？你能订阅一些付款方式吗？你也听说过产品/市场的适合性，对吗？客户在某一特定市场上真正追求你的产品的想法。实际上，我认为有一种叫做商业模式/公司模式的东西，你可以在那里拥有世界上最好的产品。事实上，你可以有适合的产品/市场，但如果你有错误的商业模式，你就无法长期资助和发展你的公司。所以这有点像一种先进的东西，比如如果你没有产品/市场的合适性，你就不需要担心这个问题，因为如果你没有产品/市场，你就没有公司。但我们在达到产品/市场匹配后不久就遇到了一个问题，误解了驱动这家公司的商业模式是什么？我认为实际上有七、八、九种不同的商业模式，这些模式是硬件公司或硬技术公司可以使用的。我一直在研究，把公司分成不同的类别，你有一些订阅公司，比如世界上销售的鸟巢或Dropcams，环网，每月3到10美元的健康订阅，但是你会看到其他公司试图做类似的事情，但它就是行不通的，我认为这是因为，所以在我们的例子中，我想我们并没有为订阅而挣扎。我们用它做实验。这对我们来说并不管用，但我们搞砸的原因是我们不明白我们处在一个热门市场。点击驱动是你推出的消费产品，希望它是一个成功。它与产品/市场相吻合，人们开始把它从你的手中拉出来。就像一家游戏公司一样，我们没有意识到我们必须超级节俭，超低预算，因为我们开发了新产品，并试图设计另一个成功。我们的第一批产品肯定很受欢迎。我不认为我们的任何后来的产品都没有达到逃逸的速度，我想如果我们建立了一个更节俭的组织。如果我们能够制造出更便宜的产品，然后推出它们并测试它们是否成功，如果它们成功了，扩大规模，等等，我认为我们可能会有一个稍微不同的结果。我的意思是，这可以追溯到硬件公司有不同的模式，你需要确保你是正确的。你必须扪心自问，就像，我们真的应该在订阅模式上吗？这真的是顾客想要的吗？如果他们想花5美元，每月10美元，你不能强迫它。如果你强迫它，就像我想要做的那样，你可能会增加额外的问题，比如在为你的客户打造好的产品的基础上。

- So pivoting a little bit to hard tech, so we've funded lots of cool hard tech companies lately, quantum computing, self driving cars, 3D printing entire homes, so on and so forth.

-所以我们把重点转向了硬技术，所以我们最近资助了很多酷的硬科技公司，量子计算，自动驾驶汽车，3D打印整个家庭等等。

- Agriculture technology.

-农业技术。

- Yeah, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion.

-是的，核裂变，核聚变

- Aerospace, space.

-航天、太空。

- Space, yes, rockets. Lots of satellites and rockets. So maybe we can calibrate the conversation a little bit. How do you define hard tech, deep tech, what does that really involve?

-太空，是的，火箭。很多卫星和火箭。所以也许我们可以调整一下谈话。你如何定义硬技术，深科技，这到底涉及到什么？

- For me, I think what I'm excited about in harder technology spaces is the, in the software world, the iteration cycles are quite short. You can push code to your repo and have it go live within seconds, and so you can rapidly iterate on your product, can get feedback from your customers. I think hard tech companies can't.
They don't have the same rapid iteration cycle.
The either have hardware in the mix, which kind of is not at that same speed yet, though it is dramatically decreasing in the amount of time that each iteration cycle takes, or you might have some sort of fundamental technology that you're working on that needs to be developed in order to unlock a new business model or a new use case, or you might be regulatorily constrained, either in the medical device space, drone space, transportation space, self driving car space, these are all like, there's external processes that you can't control that affect your iteration cycle time.

-对我来说，我觉得在更困难的技术空间里我兴奋的是，在软件世界里，迭代周期很短。您可以将代码推送到您的回购程序中，并让它在几秒钟内运行，这样您就可以快速地迭代您的产品，并从您的客户那里得到反馈。我认为科技公司做不到。它们没有相同的快速迭代周期。要么硬件还没有达到相同的速度，虽然每次迭代周期所需的时间都在急剧减少，要么你需要开发一些需要开发的基本技术来解锁一个新的业务模型或一个新的用例，或者你可能会受到一定的限制，因为你需要开发一些基本的技术来解锁一个新的业务模型或一个新的用例，或者你可能会经常受到限制，无论是在医疗设备空间，无人机空间，交通空间，自动驾驶汽车空间，这些都是你无法控制的外部过程，影响你的迭代周期时间。

- So say I have this crazy idea, something to do with rockets or something insane to most people, normal to me of course.

-所以说我有一个疯狂的想法，和火箭有关，或者对大多数人来说是疯狂的，当然，对我来说是正常的。

- Except a rocket scientist.

除了火箭科学家

-Yeah.
And I have no money. Where do I even start? What do I do?

-是啊而且我没有钱。我该从哪里开始呢？我做什么好？

- It doesn't cost that much money to get started these days. You can do something like Startup School where they give you free money to invest in, like if you're working on AR and machine learning, you can use that to get compute credits.

-这些天开始工作不花那么多钱你可以做一些像StartupSchool这样的事情，他们给你免费的资金来投资，比如如果你在学习AR和机器学习，你可以用它来获得计算学分。

- Well maybe a better question is what is an MVP?

-也许一个更好的问题是什么是MVP？

- For most of these harder tech? So for medical devices, I think the MVP is successfully peer reviewed science, that supports what you're working on that there's some sort of opportunity here, and an understanding of what you're path to clearance is. Those are in my opinion I think the best companies, because they're the ones who have shown that they understand which business model they're in, and they know what it's gonna take, what's gonna be taken of them to get sales.
They don't necessarily have to be too far along that path.
And I think at that stage, investors start to get excited, when they see the mating of science and a use case. We've had a bunch of companies that are working on rockets and satellites and propulsion and that kind of thing. For those cases, it's usually some sort of subset, scaled representation of what you're working on.
And customers, so in all cases even if you're working on regulatory constrained products, having customers either contributing money to you, like through early contracts, or further along on the pilot track, the better. I think oftentimes engineers, we love to build things. We don't as much love to sell them, and so what I look for in early stage companies is are the founders technically competent? And do they understand that they're gonna have to perverse themselves to become salespeople? Or not?

-对大多数这些更难的技术来说？所以对于医疗设备，我认为MVP是成功的同行评审科学，它支持你正在做的工作-这里有某种机会，并且理解你是如何获得许可的。在我看来，我认为是最好的公司，因为他们已经证明了他们知道自己所处的商业模式，他们知道他们需要什么，他们会从他们身上得到什么来获得销售。他们不一定要走得太远。我认为在那个阶段，当投资者看到科学和用例的结合时，他们开始兴奋起来。我们有很多公司在做火箭、卫星和推进之类的工作。对于这些情况，它通常是某种子集，对您正在进行的工作进行缩放表示。和客户，所以在所有情况下，即使你在研发受监管约束的产品，让客户为你捐款，比如通过早期的合同，或者在试点的道路上走得更远，都会更好。我经常想到工程师，我们喜欢建造东西。我们不太喜欢出售它们，所以我在早期公司寻找的是创始人技术上的能力吗？他们知不知道要成为销售人员就得做变态？还是不？

- What do you find by demo day, when they're in front of lots of investors, what is it that you encourage them to accomplish by then? It sounds like there's two paths.
There's business, if you can do sales, there's no regulatory issues to doing sales. You should have some paid contracts, LOIs maybe, and then also technical validation. Like proof that you can actually build this.

-你在演示日发现了什么，当他们面对很多投资者时，你鼓励他们在那之前完成什么？听起来有两条路。有生意，如果你能做销售，做销售就没有监管问题。您应该有一些付费合同，Lois可能，然后技术验证。比如证明你可以建造这个。

- Yeah, and I think too often people convolve these and they say I don't wanna do sales until I have something that I can show to them. That's just not true. Most customers, if you explain that they have a problem, and you have a way to solve it, they'll get excited, and if they're not excited, it's probably a sign that they don't really have a problem. That they wanna solve.
And so oftentimes we get companies that come in at the beginning of YC, and they say, well we wanna spend the first two months working on improving the prototype and getting it to the point where we're proud of it.
And then we'll do sales in the last month, and we kind of flip that around. Do the sales, hit the pavement, talk to customers, and you'll actually build a better first product for them, than if you just built it first and then showed it.

-是的，我想人们经常会把这些转过来，他们说我不想做销售，除非我有什么东西可以展示给他们看。那不是真的。大多数客户，如果你解释他们有问题，你有办法解决，他们会兴奋起来，如果他们不兴奋，这可能是他们没有真正的问题的迹象。他们想解决的问题。因此，我们经常会有一些公司在YC成立之初就加入，他们说，我们希望在最初的两个月里致力于改进原型，并让它达到我们为之自豪的程度。然后我们会在最后一个月做销售，然后我们就可以扭转局面了。做好销售，铺路，与客户交谈，你实际上会为他们打造一个更好的第一产品，而不是你先建造，然后展示出来。

- It also gives you confidence that you're going down the right track. If someone gives you...

-它也给了你信心，相信你会走上正确的轨道。如果有人给你.。

- Yeah, and it's hard. Like we had a company in the last batch that had been working for two years on building a prototype.
They were commercializing some technology that they worked on in a university, and it had a hardware component, and I remember seeing, I think it was their third application, second or third application to YC, and they had similar videos of them doing the demo with their technology, and we liked their commitment, like they had been coming back and their technology was getting better, and they were just starting to talk to customers, and we said, let's give 'em a shot, so we brought 'em in for an interview, accepted them in, and then basically the first week we took 'em aside and just said, you need to start selling. You need to get people excited and interested, and it was almost like a 180 for them, because they thought that we were gonna say you should work on the technology and get to the point where you have working units, widgets that you can sell, and we said no. Start going and talking to customers, and it took a little while for them to get up to speed. It's like exercising a new muscle, especially for engineers, and within the span of two months, they went through several roller coasters of having zero leads to having a whole bunch of leads to having them all collapse, and no one's signing, and then probably like six or seven weeks into YC, they sent us a note, and they were like, we got our first contract, and then they got their second contract, and they got their third, and then by demo day, they had already line on four or five million dollars in sales, and it all happened in the span of three months because they stopped working necessarily on just building their technology.
They were still working, like they had a three or four person team, so they were able to split it up, but the focus, the number one goal became how do we get sales.

是啊而且很难就像我们有一家公司在上一批已经工作了两年的建造一个原型。他们把大学里的一些技术商业化了，它有一个硬件组件，我记得看到，这是他们对YC的第三个应用，第二个或第三个应用，他们有类似的视频，他们用他们的技术做演示，我们喜欢他们的承诺，就像他们回来了，他们的技术越来越好，他们刚开始和顾客交谈，我们说，让他们试试看，所以我们带他们来面试，接受他们，然后基本上在第一周我们把他们拉到一边说，你需要开始销售。你需要让人们兴奋和感兴趣，这对他们来说几乎是180英镑，因为他们认为我们应该说你应该在技术上工作，并且达到你可以销售的工作单元，小部件，而我们拒绝了。开始和顾客交谈，他们花了一小段时间才能跟上速度。这就像锻炼一根新肌肉，特别是对工程师来说，在两个月的时间里，他们经历了几次过山车-“零”导致一大群人崩溃，没有人签字，然后大概在YC的6到7周里，他们给我们发了一张纸条，他们就像，我们得到了我们的第一份合同，然后他们得到了第二份合同，他们拿到了第三份合同，到了演示日，他们已经有了四五百万美元的销售额，而这一切都发生在三个月内，因为他们停止了仅仅在建立他们的技术上的工作。他们仍然在工作，就像他们有一个三四个人的团队，所以他们能够分开，但重点，第一目标是如何获得销售。

- So, say, I mean you do a lot of trips where you go to schools, specifically, and you talk to scientists and engineers, many in PhD programs. I guess what is your advice to them to make the jump? What should they consider? A lot of them are thinking about commercializing it, but maybe they think, I don't know what they think, actually. But what is your one-two punch on that?

所以，我的意思是，你经常去学校旅行，特别是和科学家和工程师交谈，很多是博士课程。我想你对他们的建议是什么？他们应该考虑什么？他们中的很多人都在考虑把它商业化，但也许他们会想，我不知道他们到底在想什么。但你的一二拳是什么？

- Having started my company in a university town, versus somewhere here like Silicon Valley, I felt very protected.
There were a lot of government grants. I was able to raise non diluted funding, and plus side is we were able to use that funding to work on the project, but the downside was, there was no pressure to have some sort of product that customers would pay money for. It wasn't really in the DNA of the startup ecosystem that I was in. Most people were just entranced with working on their startup, and not necessarily getting to that next stage of building a profitable, longer term corp, and I think that that sometimes affects people who are in universities even more, because the default is raising money through grants and working on longer term projects, whereas the special case is spinning out a company and actually trying to get customers to buy it.
And I think what I would encourage is try getting out of your comfort zone. Just as an experience, or experiment. Don't say that you have to dive in head first with no parachute, but if you're working on some sort of technology that you think could have some sort of positive business impact, like get out of the lab. Go to some conferences. Talk to people. Not educational conferences, like corporate, sales conferences. Start talking to customers, and see what people think.
And that's a start.
And hopefully, I mean if you're lucky and things are in the right spot, again customers will be like where has this been all my life. Like this is amazing. This is exactly what we've been dreaming of. I can't believe it finally came out of the lab, and that should be the momentum that just pulls you along, but you have to get out to at least try it.

-我在大学城开了公司，而在硅谷这样的地方，我感到很受保护。有很多政府拨款。我能够筹集到非稀释的资金，另外的一面是，我们能够利用这些资金来完成这个项目，但不利的是，我们没有压力让客户花钱购买某种产品。并不是在我所处的创业生态系统的DNA里。大多数人只是为创业而着迷，但不一定会进入下一个阶段，即建立一个盈利的、长期的公司。我认为，这有时会对大学里的人产生更大的影响，因为违约是通过赠款和长期项目筹集资金，而特例是剥离一家公司，并试图让客户购买它。我想我会鼓励你走出你的舒适区。作为一种体验或实验。不要说你必须先在没有降落伞的情况下跳入头部，但是如果你在研究某种你认为可能会对商业产生积极影响的技术，比如离开实验室。去参加一些会议。跟人说话。不是像公司那样的教育会议，而是销售会议。开始和顾客交谈，看看人们是怎么想的。这是个开始。希望我的意思是，如果你幸运的话，事情就在正确的位置，顾客就会像我这辈子在哪里一样。就像这太神奇了。这正是我们一直梦想的。我不敢相信它终于从实验室里出来了，这应该是把你拉过来的动力，但你至少得试一试。

- So say you get to the point where you feel confident you have some amount of interest in your product. But to actually build it, you need lots and lots and lots of money. What do you need to show to investors?

-比如说，你对你的产品有一定的兴趣，你会觉得很有信心。但要真正建造它，你需要大量的钱。你需要向投资者展示什么？

- So the best companies in my opinion are the ones that don't require a ton of money to work on, or at least to get to some sort of MVP stage, kind of like with all advice that YC gives, it's usually applicable to 90% of the companies, and then there's always 5% on either side that are in a special case. But even some of the best hard tech companies I've seen, they don't have a binary outcome where they need someone to insert 100 million dollars, and that's the only thing that can develop a product. Like take, I mean, I don't know anything about these companies other than press reports, but take Magic Leap versus Oculus, right? Magic Leap raised lots of money, and spent 11 years working on a product, versus Oculus which raised two million dollars on Kickstarter, shipped an early development kit that was not amazing, but they iterated, and they got through, and now the Oculus, the new one that's like 400 bucks, doesn't need a computer, it's exactly, yeah, the Quest. Like that's exactly what people are dreaming of now.
And they're gonna have it within six months, and they had to go through six, seven years of painful iteration, but they did it.
And yeah.

因此，在我看来，最好的公司是那些不需要花很多钱去工作的公司，或者至少是达到某种MVP阶段的公司，就像YC给出的所有建议一样，它通常适用于90%的公司，然后双方都有5%的公司处于特殊情况下。但即使是我所见过的一些最优秀的科技公司，他们也没有一个二元的结果，他们需要有人投入1亿美元，而这是唯一能够开发一个产品的东西。比如说，我的意思是，除了媒体报道之外，我对这些公司一无所知，但以“魔术飞跃”和“Oculus”为例，对吗？魔术Leap筹集了很多钱，花了11年的时间研发了一款产品，而Oculus在Kickstarter上筹到了200万美元，它提供了一套早期的开发工具，并不令人惊讶，但他们进行了迭代，然后他们成功了。现在，Oculus，这款新产品大约400美元，不需要一台电脑，它确实是，是的，任务。就像人们现在梦寐以求的那样。他们将在六个月内完成，他们必须经历六年、七年的痛苦循环，但他们做到了。而且是的。

- So last question, then we're take audience questions. What's an idea, just so curious, what's an idea that sounded so crazy to you when you heard about it, but then when you met the founder and they stepped through everything, you were like, oh, that's not so crazy. This is totally possible.

-最后一个问题，我们来回答观众的问题.什么是想法，只是这么好奇，什么想法听起来很疯狂，当你听到这个想法时，当你遇到创办人的时候，他们走遍了所有的事情，你会想，哦，这不是那么疯狂。这完全有可能。

- Relativity Space. So, that was a company that went through YC four, three years ago, not very long.
They wanted to build 3D printed rockets.
Their thesis was it's not actually rocket assembly that costs a lot of money. It's the testing phase of integration, where if you have hundreds of different systems that have to work perfectly with each other, when you assemble and build the final rocket, you have to test everything. Slightly different path than SpaceX which is going for the reusability thing. So their thesis was if we can 3D print the entire rocket, from the tip of the exhaust to the motor to everything, in one piece, the integration time is zero. Because you just print it. So they're working on this, and it was just an idea. I think they did a Hot Fire during YC. I think they were working on it, I don't know exactly how long they had been working on it for, but yeah, that's a pretty crazy idea, and to come through YC, especially to pitch to investors that probably were not all space investors, must have taken some guts, but they did it.
They showed off their first 3D printed rocket.
They raised early funding off of that.
They started work on their larger products, and raised a whole bunch more money. I think they just raisedlast year.

-相对论空间。所以，这是一家在四年、三年前通过YC的公司，时间不长。他们想制造3D打印火箭。他们的论断是，并不是真正的火箭装配花了很多钱。这是集成的测试阶段，如果您有数百个不同的系统必须彼此完美地工作，当您组装和构建最终的火箭时，您必须测试所有的东西。与SpaceX略有不同，SpaceX正致力于可重用性的研究。所以他们的论文是，如果我们能3D打印整个火箭，从排气端到发动机，再到所有东西，整整齐齐，积分时间为零。因为你只是打印出来。所以他们正在做这件事，这只是一个想法。我想他们在YC的时候做了一场大火。我想他们是在做这件事，我不知道他们花了多长时间研究这个问题，但是的，这是一个非常疯狂的想法，要想通过YC，尤其是向可能不是所有太空投资者的投资者推销，肯定需要一些勇气，但他们做到了。他们展示了他们的第一个3D打印火箭。他们从这方面提前筹集了资金。他们开始研究更大的产品，并筹集了更多的资金。我想他们是去年刚长大的。

- They also, they worked previously at SpaceX or Blue Origin, but they didn't have many years of experience, so it was kind of actually crazy in the sense also they were extremely young, and for this kind of thing to think of this.

-他们以前在SpaceX或者蓝色起源公司工作过，但是他们没有很多年的经验，所以从某种意义上说，这是一种疯狂的感觉-他们非常年轻，对于这类事情来说，他们会想到这一点。

- Yeah, and people believed in their vision.
They had demonstrated it enough. I think, of what they were working on.
And I think it was actually interesting, so I think they, I don't wanna say to much in case I'm wrong, but I think they were working on the printer first, and they were looking for an application for this massive metal 3D printer that they had built, and they found space as the, I mean it was their background, and their passion, so I think that's the one that they took it in, that direction that they took it in. I see this a lot with people who are working on really cool, kind of fundamental technology, I think PG actually had a pretty good tweet about this a couple of weeks ago. He said, if you're in a situation where you're building something that's mindblowingly cool and revolutionary, but you're finding that customers don't wanna buy it, pivot your company so you're actually doing what your customers would have done, and just use your pioneering technology to do what they do faster, better, or cheaper.
And sell to their customers.
And that's kind of I think what Relativity did, is they were building this new 3D printer, and they realized that we could just build rockets with this technology, and will be better than everyone else who's building rockets in that space.

-是的，人们相信他们的远见.他们已经证明得够多了。我觉得他们在做什么。我觉得这真的很有趣，所以我想他们，我不想说太多，以防我说错了，但我认为他们首先在研究打印机，他们在寻找他们建造的大型金属3D打印机的应用程序，他们找到了空间，我的意思是，这是他们的背景，他们的热情，所以我认为这就是他们接受的方向，他们接受的方向。我看到很多人都在研究非常酷的基础技术，我认为PG在几周前已经有了一条很好的推特。他说，如果你正处于这样一种情况下，你正在建造一种令人印象深刻的酷和革命性的东西，但你发现客户不想买它，让你的公司转向你的公司，这样你实际上就能做你的客户应该做的事情，只需要使用你的先进技术来做他们所做的更快、更好或更便宜的事情。卖给他们的顾客。这就是相对论所做的，他们正在建造一台新的3D打印机，他们意识到我们可以用这种技术制造火箭，并且会比在那个空间里建造火箭的人更好。

- Cool, so questions? You first.

-酷，那么问题呢？你先来。

- [Audience Member] Speaking of that, we've actually sold cups of coffee at 40 bucks a piece now, but we're making equipment for coffee shops to eliminate bitterness, based on the founding technology, and how do you find those first customers? You did 1,500 Pebbles before you went public, but how did you get the 1 through 50?

-(观众)说到这点，我们现在已经以40美元一杯的价格卖出了咖啡，但我们正在为咖啡店制造设备，以消除苦味，基于创建技术，你是如何找到第一批顾客的？你在上市前做了1500颗鹅卵石，但你是怎么得到1到50的？

- So the question was, how do you get your first customers? How do you get 1 through 50? I talked about this a little bit earlier. Some of the best ways is to infiltrate the community of people who you think will want your product.
There are an unlimited set of places on the internet where people talk about products and they talk about services.
They can range from, you know where the Whatsapp guy posted his app first? Back in 2009? He posted it on Flyer Talk forums, which is like a whole bunch of geeky business people how fly a lot, and that's where he posted it, and think about that as your first, as the first user group for Whatsapp. It's perfect, right? It's travelers who wanna talk to people all around the world, who are tired of paying for overpriced SMS bills, and it's 2009, so people are just starting to get smart phones and that kind of thing. Perfect, like you couldn't have planned it better if you tried, and so the best companies are the ones that just kind of get out there. For us, we got a lot of press in the early days by talking to bloggers, so I liked formed personal relationships with all of the Blackberry bloggers at the time, if anyone remembers Crackberry, Crackberry Kevin, yeah, and so I would like fly out to conferences, on dirt cheap red eyes, and just, instead of buying tickets to the conference, I think we would just kind of sneak around and get into the press, like once at CES, back in 2009, we just walked into Engadget's trailer, like Engadget had this big trailer where all their reporters were working, and we didn't know anyone, so we just walked in, and then just started pitching to people and ended up getting, there's like a picture of my wrist with a broken watch. It didn't even work at the time, but it's like, so and so is working on a smartwatch, and that drove a ton of traffic in the early days, was just people self identifying as this was something that I wanted.

-所以问题是，你是如何得到你的第一批顾客的？你怎么得到1到50？我之前谈过这件事。一些最好的方法是渗透到你认为想要你的产品的人的社区。互联网上有一套无限的场所，人们谈论产品，谈论服务。它们可以是，你知道Whatsapp的家伙在哪里最先发布他的应用程序吗？早在2009年？他把它发到了FILER Talk论坛上，这些论坛就像一群讨厌的商人，他就是在那里发布的，并把这作为你的第一次，作为Whatsapp的第一个用户组来考虑。很完美对吧？是旅行者想和世界各地的人交谈，他们厌倦了支付过高的短信账单，现在是2009年，所以人们才刚刚开始买智能手机之类的东西。完美，就像如果你尝试的话，你不可能有更好的计划，所以最好的公司就是那些刚刚走出去的公司。对我们来说，在最初的日子里，我们通过和博主交谈得到了很多新闻，所以我喜欢和当时所有的黑莓博主建立个人关系，如果有人记得Crackberry，Crackberry Kevin，是的，所以我想坐飞机去参加会议，用廉价的红色眼睛，只是，不去买会议的门票，我想我们会偷偷摸摸地进入媒体，比如在2009年的CES，我们刚刚走进Engadget的预告片，就像Engadget有一个很大的预告片，他们所有的记者都在那里工作，而我们不认识任何人，所以我们就走了进来，然后开始向人们推销，最后得到了，就像我的手腕上有一块坏了的手表。它在当时甚至不起作用，但它就像，所以和那样的工作在智能手表，这推动了大量的交通在早期，只是人们自我识别，因为这是我想要的东西。

- Yeah, it takes a lot of hustle, for sure. Okay, right here.

-是的，这肯定需要很大的努力。好的，就在这里。

- [Audience Member] So Eric, we are in the business of, so we are software engineers only software, but not in hardware. So that's a struggle, is should we outsource that? Or no? Things have changed since, so...

-[观众成员]那么Eric，我们是做软件工程师的，所以我们只是软件工程师，而不是硬件工程师。所以这是一场斗争，我们应该把它外包吗？还是没有？从那以后一切都变了所以.。

- Yeah, things are much easier. So question is like, we're a bunch of software engineers. We have an idea that includes software and hardware, how do we get started on the hardware? Well the good news is that it's easier than ever. I wrote a blog post that was on TechCrunch a couple months ago about how software engineers can get started on this, and the recipe's pretty simple. Find an off the shelf product that kind of does what you want to do, that's kind of like halfway there, that you can actually just buy off Amazon, or Alibaba or something, because the amount of time and money and tears that you'll save just by buying a product that's halfway to what you wanna build will do a couple things. One is it will get you within two or three days, or however long shipping takes, an actual physical representation of what you think you wanna build, and you will begin to use it, hopefully, to solve the problem that you wanna solve, and you will learn, like, maybe I'm completely wrong, and this often happens.
The best intentioned product when you actually build it might not actually solve the problem that you wanna solve, so getting halfway there for like 200 bucks, or 300 bucks, plus shipping, is just so much better than weeks and months of prototyping just to get to the same level.
The next step after this is to take the 50% there product, or 75% there product, and hack it to do what you think is better. Either adding a little bit of technology onto it, and adding your software stack, modifying it. It can be as simple as repurposing the same technology and like changing the set up. A good example of this would be the scooter companies.
They took Xiaomi Scooters, Ninebot scooters, and they just glued on cell modems. That's it. That's how scooter sharing started. It's like cell modems and GPS plus a scooter.
They didn't build the scooter themselves.
They just bought it off Alibaba, and they bought the modems from some company that was making modems, so that's kind of the prototype I think for the next generation of consumer hardware, as well as enterprise hardware. We had a company two batches ago that builds cameras for neighborhood security and they used a Raspberry Pi and a Pi Cam, and a 3D printed case.
And they sold those for like hundreds, thousands of dollars.
And the hardware cost a very small amount of money, and they're just solving a real problem for end customers, and people are paying them in exchange for that. So, yeah, it's easier than ever. You can find people on Alibaba. You can meet factories over WeChat. Just don't try to build it all yourself. Don't hire an industrial design firm to build you some new design. Don't hire an engineering firm that promises to do a custom design for you, because that'll cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it probably will be the wrong product versus spending 300 bucks, buying something, meeting the factory that makes that current product, and asking them to make the changes that you wanna make.

-是的，事情要容易得多.所以问题是，我们是一群软件工程师。我们有一个想法，包括软件和硬件，我们如何开始硬件？好消息是这比以往任何时候都容易。几个月前，我在TechCrunch上写了一篇关于软件工程师如何开始这方面工作的博文，这个方法非常简单。找到一种现成的产品，它能做你想做的事情，就像半途而废，你可以买下亚马逊，或者阿里巴巴之类的东西，因为只要买到一款你想要的产品，你就可以节省大量的时间、金钱和眼泪。一是它将在两三天内，或者无论运输时间有多长，你认为你想要建造的东西的实际表现，你会开始用它来解决你想要解决的问题，你会学到，也许，我完全错了，而且这种情况经常发生。最好的产品-当你真正建造它的时候-可能并不能解决你想要解决的问题，所以花200美元，或者300美元，再加上发货，就能解决一半的问题，比几周甚至几个月的原型制作要好得多，只是为了达到相同的水平。在此之后的下一步是将50%的产品，或75%的产品，然后黑客做你认为更好的事情。要么给它添加一点技术，然后添加你的软件栈，修改它。它可以很简单，就像重新使用相同的技术，并且喜欢更改设置。一个很好的例子就是滑板车公司。他们拿走了小米滑板车，九辆机器人滑板车，他们只是粘在手机调制解调器上。就这样这就是滑板车分享的开始。就像手机调制解调器和GPS加上一个滑板车。他们不是自己造的。他们刚刚从阿里巴巴买下了调制解调器，他们从一家生产调制解调器的公司那里买了调制解调器，所以我认为这是下一代消费硬件的原型，也是企业硬件的原型。两批前我们有一家公司为社区安全制作摄像头，他们使用了Raspberry PI和PI凸轮，还有一个3D打印的箱子。他们以数百，数千美元的价格卖掉了这些。而硬件只花了很少的钱，他们只是为终端客户解决了一个真正的问题，人们为此付出了代价。所以，是的，这比以往任何时候都容易。你可以在阿里巴巴上找到人。你可以在微信上和工厂见面。只是不要试图把它全部建立起来。不要雇佣一家工业设计公司为你设计一些新的设计。不要雇佣一家工程公司承诺为你做一个定制的设计，因为这将花费几十万美元，这可能是错误的产品而不是花费300美元，购买一些东西，满足制造当前产品的工厂，并要求他们做出你想要的改变。

- [Audience Member] Before product/market fit, do you recommend founders to move closer to the supplier do places like Shenzhen or Beijing?

-[观众]在产品/市场适应之前，你是否建议创始人离供应商更近一些，比如深圳或北京？

- It depends, so the question is, should you move closer to Shezhen or factories when you are pre product/market fit? If you're pre product/market fit, and you have a product that you're iterating on, like figure out a way to reduce the iteration cycles, so that you get more chances to dazzle customers, and to find that product/market fit. So you could solve that two ways. If you think that moving to the factories will enable you to do faster iteration, and you already have sales channels set up, that's cool. If not, and you don't really have that many customers, then move closer to your customers, so that the iteration can be done in software, maybe, not hardware, and you're just spending every minute in front of your customers, so we have a couple companies that did that in the last batch, and they were using drones to solve very specific business process problems, and they basically just moved to where those businesses are, took up a crappy motel room, and turned that motel room into a drone factory, where they were making and modifying their drone. In that case, it was probably the right call for them.

-这要视情况而定，所以问题是，当你的产品/市场合适时，你是否应该向设镇或工厂靠拢？如果你是预产品/市场适合，你有一个产品，你正在迭代，比如想出一个方法来减少迭代周期，这样你就有更多的机会让客户眼花缭乱，找到适合的产品/市场。所以你可以用两种方法解决。如果您认为迁移到工厂将使您能够完成更快的迭代，并且您已经设置了销售渠道，这是很酷的。如果没有，而且你没有那么多客户，那就离你的客户更近一点，这样迭代就可以在软件上完成，而不是硬件上，而你只是在你的客户面前花费每一分钟，所以我们有几家公司在最后一批中就这样做了，他们用无人机来解决非常具体的业务流程问题，他们基本上只是搬到了那些企业的地方，住了一间破旧的汽车旅馆房间，把汽车旅馆的房间变成了一个无人机工厂，在那里他们在制造和改造他们的无人机。在这种情况下，这可能是正确的要求他们。

- Right here.

-就在这儿

- [Audience Member] Do we have to protect our products? Or how can we protect them?

-[观众]我们必须保护我们的产品吗？或者我们怎么保护他们？

- Protection, IP protection. Trademark protection. Is that kind of what you're interested in? So yeah, patents, that kind of thing. So, this question I think touches on how do you build a moat for your company? How do you make sure that once you figure out a beautiful product, figure out who to sell it to, that some other dude doesn't come along and just steal your idea? So there's a couple ways that you can solve this.
The best ways in my opinion are companies that have some sort of innate moat where, it's either network effect, where the more people that use your product, the better it is for everyone. Or some sort of data lock in, where you use the product, you generate data.
The data happens to be within one ecosystem. Someone who builds a competing piece of hardware can't get that data easily. Those are the two best, but what do you think about that?

-保护、知识产权保护。商标保护。你对此感兴趣吗？所以是的专利之类的东西。所以，我认为这个问题涉及到你如何为你的公司建立一条护城河？你如何确保一旦你找到一个漂亮的产品，找出卖给谁，其他人不会来偷你的想法？所以有几种方法可以解决这个问题。在我看来，最好的方法是那些有某种与生俱来的护城河的公司-这要么是网络效应，要么是使用你产品的人越多，对每个人都越有利。或者某种类型的数据锁定，在使用产品的地方，生成数据。这些数据恰好在一个生态系统中。构建一个相互竞争的硬件的人不可能轻易地获得这些数据。这两个是最好的，但你觉得呢？

- I think those are good. I also think patents previously used to be very hard to get, but now, there's like, we have a company called Cognition IP. I would just use them, and just pay them some little amount of money, and then get patents.

-我觉得这些很好.我也认为以前的专利很难获得，但是现在，我们有了一家叫做认知IP的公司。我只会用它们，只需付给他们少量的钱，然后获得专利。

- They use software to help you file. So the problem with patents is that they're not, like if you're thinking about this problem, specifically how do we block other people from copying our idea, they're actually really difficult tools to use. Versus those other two things that I described that are actually, like you control all of the levers. If you can build a product that has built in network effect, or build in data things, you control that. Like you don't have to rely on lawyers. You don't have to rely on the government. You don't have to rely on the courts to enforce your domain dominance, but if you rely on patents, that kind of thing, you're basically saying, I'm putting this money down as an investment, but I'm gonna have to invest a lot more money later, in order to unlock that first investment, so it's very rare that startups build a successful moat using patents. This happens much more in like biotech, space.

-他们用软件帮你归档。所以专利的问题在于，如果你在思考这个问题，特别是我们如何阻止其他人复制我们的想法，它们实际上是很难使用的工具。相对于我描述的其他两件事，实际上，就像你控制了所有的杠杆。如果您可以生成一个内置了网络效果的产品，或者可以构建数据，那么您可以控制它。就像你不需要依赖律师。你不必依赖政府。你不需要依靠法院来强化你的领域支配地位，但是如果你依赖专利之类的东西，你基本上是在说，我把这笔钱作为一种投资，但我以后要投入更多的钱，为了解开第一笔投资，因此，初创企业利用专利建立成功的护城河是非常罕见的。这种情况在生物技术、太空中发生得更多。

- Yes, yeah, I agree with that. I think building really great products is really just the only way to really build the moat.

-是的，我同意.我认为建造真正伟大的产品是真正建造护城河的唯一途径。

- Again, for 5% of companies, there might be some sort of patent strategy, but for 95%, it's great products.

-同样，对5%的公司来说，可能有某种专利策略，但对95%的公司来说，这是一种很棒的产品。

- Yeah, I think if it's also easy to build, people can just copy it, even if you get the patent, so it doesn't really matter.

-是的，我认为如果它也很容易建造，人们就可以复制它，即使你获得了专利，所以它并不重要。

- Well that's the thing. You need money to enforce the patents. You need time to enforce it, and if your company's dead, it's hard to enforce patents.

-好吧，这就是问题所在.你需要钱来执行专利。你需要时间来执行它，如果你的公司死了，就很难执行专利。

- Cool, back there.

-酷，后面

- [Audience Member] If you're building a product which is trying to solve a hard, hard tech problem, like solving social media disruption with AI, how do you convince people that you can get a lot of different users when you're going after what looks like a very marginal market to?

-[观众成员]如果你正在开发一款产品，试图解决一个棘手的技术难题，比如用人工智能解决社交媒体的混乱，你如何让人们相信，当你在追求一个看似非常边缘的市场时，你能得到很多不同的用户？

- Marginal markets are great So the question was, what happens if I'm building a hard tech problem, trying to solve a longer term problem. That first problem that I'm solving, what if it looks too small? Honestly, the best investors will wanna see a small market. Because a small market at the beginning means you can identify who's in that market very cheaply, versus having to boil the ocean, saying well there's like 2% of all people in the world who are interested, versus like 80% of this one group. So it's cheaper and easier for you to find those customers.
The second thing is that small group of people will tell you quicker whether you have a good product or not, because they know that they have a problem, and you're telling them hey, buy this thing, it solves your problem.
They can use it and be like, oh yeah, that solves it. Good. Problem solved.
They'll give you feedback. Whereas if you're trying to again target a really large group with a vague product idea, it's gonna be harder to know whether that person just wasn't interested that week. Maybe they didn't have enough money.
There's more reasons than you had a bad product, if it's a really vague and large market.

-边际市场是伟大的，所以问题是，如果我建立一个困难的技术问题，试图解决一个长期的问题，会发生什么。我要解决的第一个问题，如果看上去太小怎么办？老实说，最好的投资者会希望看到一个小市场。因为一开始就有一个小市场意味着你可以很便宜地识别出谁在这个市场上，而不是必须煮沸海洋，说世界上有大约2%的人对这个市场感兴趣，而这一群体中大约有80%的人对此感兴趣。所以更便宜更容易找到那些顾客。第二件事是，一小群人会更快地告诉你是否有好的产品，因为他们知道他们有问题，而你告诉他们嘿，买这个东西，它解决了你的问题。他们可以用它，就像，哦，是的，这解决了它。好的问题解决了。他们会给你反馈。然而，如果你再次试图用一个模糊的产品概念来锁定一个很大的群体，那么就很难知道那个人是不是在那个星期不感兴趣了。也许他们没有足够的钱。有更多的原因比你有一个糟糕的产品，如果它是一个非常模糊和大的市场。

- Yeah, just to add onto that I think starting small is good, but also having a roadmap to how it builds into something big is good as well, for investors, specifically.

-是的，我只是想补充一点-我认为从小到小是件好事，但对于投资者来说，有一个如何将其发展成某种大的东西的路线图也是好的。

- And for yourself as well, to know if like, to keep motivated.

-也是为了你自己，知道如果喜欢的话，保持动力。

- [Audience Member] What do you think about theof hardware service? Because now I think there's a shift between direct sells to subscription model a lot, because hardware companies can't rely only on sales.

-[观众]你对硬件服务有什么看法？因为现在我认为直接销售到订阅模式之间有了很大的转变，因为硬件公司不能只依靠销售。

- Yep.

-是的.

- They always need to have recurring revenue. So in my company, by chance, we just are doing some electronic treatment for reducing sweating, and we are so happy that people are lined up to come to our office and to treatment for that, but will this be reliable, or will it mean that?

-他们总是需要经常性的收入。所以，在我的公司，偶然的，我们只是做一些电子治疗，以减少出汗，我们很高兴，人们排队来我们的办公室和治疗，但这是可靠的，还是它的意思？

- So this question is related to like, do I pick a recurring business model, subscription business model? Hardware as a service? Or do I just sell the product? So this kind of goes back to what I was talking about before. Which is making sure that you have the right, you're pretty sure that you're in the right business model track for your company. So, there are a lot of these different tracks.
They're not just hardware as a service, not just consumer.
There's hybrid models.
There's insurance models.
There's advertising driven models.
There's a ton of different ways that you could look at it, so it's not just one or the other. Here's what I would say. On the enterprise side, you need to figure out how much money you will save your customer, or how much more money they will make, and price your product accordingly. Like, your product price to them will be less than either how much they're saving or how much more they're making, and you should try to price it as high as possible to still let them have some savings, but you should rightfully so earn some of the profit from that innovation that you have. Sometimes that may be a hardware as a service model. It might be up front, and it really depends on your customer at that point, so it's really hard for anyone to try to give advice on that front, and it's much more around talking to customers, experimenting, like you could do price experiments. Most companies are so small that every time a new person hears about them, or I'm sorry, every time they do PR, new people who've never heard about it will hear about it for the first time, and they won't know what the last price was, so you can afford to do that kind of experimentation, especially at the beginning of your company.

-因此，这个问题与这样的问题有关：我是否选择了一个重复的商业模式，即订阅业务模式？硬件作为一种服务？还是我只是把产品卖了？所以这种情况可以追溯到我之前所说的。这是确保你有权利，你很肯定你在正确的商业模式轨道上为你的公司。所以，有很多不同的轨道。它们不仅仅是作为一种服务的硬件，而不仅仅是消费者。有混合模型。有保险模型。有广告驱动的模式。你可以用很多不同的方法来看待它，所以它不仅仅是一个或另一个。我会这么说。在企业方面，您需要计算出您将为客户节省多少钱，或者他们将赚多少钱，并相应地为您的产品定价。比如，你对他们来说，你的产品价格将低于他们储蓄的多少，或者他们赚的钱，你应该尽可能地给他们定价，让他们有一些储蓄，但是你应该从你的创新中获得一些利润，这是合理的。有时，这可能是作为服务模型的硬件。它可能是预先的，而且它真的取决于你的客户在这一点上，所以这是真的很难有人试图在这方面的建议，它更多的是围绕着与客户交谈，试验，就像你可以做价格实验。大多数公司都是如此的小，以至于每当一个新的人听说他们，或者我很抱歉，每次他们做公关，新的人谁从来没有听说过它将是第一次，他们不会知道最后的价格是什么，所以你可以负担这样的实验，特别是在你的公司成立之初。

- [Audience Member] So one of the hardest problems of our space is hiring, is creating the company.

-[观众成员]因此，我们的空间中最困难的问题之一是招聘，就是创建公司。

- Yep. How do you do hiring, especially when you're scaling? Hiring is a mode that the company's in, and it's a very distracting mode. So I think like the mission of an early stage startup is to get to product/market fit, and it's definitely not to hire a team. No one gets points for hiring a team, or you get a very small number of points for hiring an amazing team. You get a lot more points for finding a product that has product/market fit. So, hiring in general is really like a touchy subject because there's no one size fits all there. Some general advice that I have is what I mentioned before, just hire for trust, and hire for reliability over hiring for specific domain knowledge. This has really benefited me because right after we kind of hit on Kickstarter, we were only two people at the company, two full time people, and two interns, and so we had like nobody, and all of a sudden we needed to hire people, and we could've spent three to six months hiring a 30 person team, and people that we would need, hire experts that have done it before. We could have spent the time doing that. We would have delayed our initial production by probably three to six months, however long it would have taken to hire that team, so what I did instead was I just phoned up some of my best friends from university who had been tangentially involved in the project, and said, you need to quit your job and just fly here, and I think all of them, we just hired seven people within three or four days, like that, and that worked because we had that momentum and we had found product/market fit, and so they were like, that's cool. I wanna be part of this rocket ship. I wanna take off. But we didn't have to do like three to six months worth of hiring. We did three to six days worth of hiring, and I knew them. I trusted them.
They were instantly part of the team, because it was just like we were working on another school project again.

-是的.你是如何招聘的，特别是当你在扩大规模的时候？招聘是公司的一种模式，也是一种非常分散注意力的模式。因此，我认为，就像早期创业公司的使命一样，它的使命是实现产品/市场的契合，而不是雇佣一个团队。没有人会因为雇用一个团队而得到分数，或者你会因为雇用一个令人惊叹的团队而得到很少的分数。找到适合产品/市场的产品会得到更多的分数。因此，总体来说，招聘真的是一个敏感的话题，因为没有一个合适的标准。我有一些一般性的建议是我前面提到的，只是雇用的信任，和雇用的可靠性，而不是雇用特定的领域知识。这让我受益匪浅，因为就在我们对Kickstart的了解之后，我们在公司只有两个人，两个全职员工，两个实习生，所以我们就像没有人一样，突然间我们需要雇佣人员，我们可以花三到六个月的时间雇佣一个30人的团队，以及我们需要的人，雇佣以前做过的专家。我们本可以花时间这么做的。我们可能会把最初的生产推迟三到六个月，不管要花多长时间才能雇佣到这个团队，所以我所做的只是打电话给我的一些大学最好的朋友，这些朋友都参与了这个项目，他们说，你需要辞职，飞到这里，我想他们都是这样的，我们在三到四天内雇佣了七个人，就像这样，因为我们有了这样的动力，我们找到了适合产品/市场的人，所以他们说，这很酷。我想成为火箭飞船的一员。我要走了。但我们不需要花三到六个月的时间来招聘。我们花了三到六天的时间雇佣他们，我也认识他们。我信任他们。他们立即成为了团队的一员，因为这就像我们又在做另一个学校的项目一样。

- It seems like the best source pool is either people you met in college, or from working.

-似乎最好的来源要么是你在大学认识的人，要么是工作中的人。

- Past jobs you've had. Yeah, too often people overlook someone that they worked at a job with two, three years ago. One of the coolest hacks that you can do is just look through, manually, slowly, look through your Facebook or Linked In, and just look at every person's name and think, is this person cool? And technical? And just go through that list, and you're probably find a cofounder. You'll probably find a first employee, like some long lost friend from high school that's actually like a super cool developer, you could hire her and just bring her on the team. Like there's...

-你以前做过的工作是啊，很多人都会忽略两到三年前他们在一份工作上工作的人。你能做的最酷的黑客之一就是浏览，手动，慢慢来，浏览你的Facebook或者链接，然后看看每个人的名字，然后想，这个人酷不酷？技术方面呢？只要翻阅那份名单，你可能会找到一个共同创始人。你可能会找到第一位员工，就像一些在高中失散已久的朋友，实际上就像一个超级酷的开发人员，你可以雇佣她，让她加入团队。好像有.。

- The second step people miss then is actually asking that person, and giving a real offer.

-人们错过的第二步实际上是问那个人，并给出一个真正的提议。

- Yeah.

-是啊

- There's always a, people do this ambiguous dance of like, oh, I don't want you to say no to me, and so I'm not gonna really ask you, and.

-总会有人跳这种模棱两可的舞蹈，哦，我不想你对我说不，所以我不会真的问你，而且.

- So there's a good book called the Hard Thing about Hard Things, by Ben Horowitz, and he talks a lot about working with friends, and the difficulties and benefits of working with friends, so I'd read that book if you do end up hiring, or working with a bunch of your friends.

-有一本很好的书，叫做“艰难的事情”，作者是本·霍洛维茨，他讲了很多关于和朋友一起工作的问题，以及和朋友一起工作的困难和好处，所以我会读这本书，如果你最终雇佣了你，或者和你的一群朋友一起工作。

- Right back there. Yeah.

-就在后面嗯

- [Audience Member] When you look at a problem and on one hand, you're like well, this might be solved with a, but it also can be a problem Is there any advice? Like oh you definitely need?

-[观众成员]当你看到一个问题的时候，一方面，你很好，这可以用a来解决，但也可以是一个问题，有什么建议吗？就像你绝对需要吗？

- Is there a, the question was, for some projects, problems can be solved exclusively by software. How do you know when to involve hardware into it? When in doubt, take all the hardware out. It doesn't solve the problem. That's the best place to start. That's why I was kind of saying like, how could you just buy something off the shelf and use it? Because you may need some hardware. You may need a camera. You may need a microphone. You may need a compute platform. Just buy a Raspberry Pi and plug USB devices into it. You don't need to build anything these days. Some people think like, but it's not gonna be in the right form factor, or it's not gonna do the exact right thing as what I think our customers need. Just try. Just build something. Hack something together, and see if it at least almost solves the problem, because like I was saying, more often than not, that initial test will prove that either you have a really good problem that really needs to be solved, or nobody really has that problem.
And you don't need to now spend three months working on custom hardware.

-问题是，对于某些项目，问题完全可以通过软件解决。你怎么知道什么时候让硬件参与其中？当有疑问的时候，把所有的硬件都拿出来。这不能解决问题。那是最好的开始。所以我才会说，你怎么能买些现成的东西来用呢？因为你可能需要一些硬件。你可能需要一个照相机。你可能需要一个麦克风。您可能需要一个计算平台。只要买一个Raspberry PI和插入USB设备到它。这些天你不需要建造任何东西。有些人是这样想的，但这不会是正确的形式因素，或者它不会做完全正确的事情，正如我认为我们的客户所需要的那样。试试看。做点什么吧。一起破解一些东西，看看它是否至少解决了这个问题，因为就像我说的，很多时候，最初的测试会证明要么你有一个真正需要解决的好问题，要么没有人真的有这个问题。现在你不需要花三个月的时间在定制硬件上工作。

- [Audience Member] I think for hardware, custom hardware startup, it is very difficult to explain to investors, because the whole user experience makes a difference. So actually we are creating a holographic therapist, but it's very, theis very bad. It's made of, so it's very bad, so what is the best way toto investors? Making video or...?

-[观众成员]我认为对于硬件，定制硬件启动，这是很难解释给投资者，因为整个用户的经验是不同的。事实上，我们正在创造一个全息治疗师，但这是非常，非常糟糕的。它是由，所以它是非常糟糕，那么什么是最好的方式投资者？录像还是.？

- So your question was, we have a really complex product, an AI psychotherapist? Or therapist that can help people. How do we demo that? Or how do we convey that product to people? I would hazard a guess that it's kind of a similar question to the last one, that's like, are there ways that we can do this in software rather than hardware? So if I were working on a project like that, I might start by actually creating the assistant as an app first, or maybe like a 3D Unity character, that approximates it, that gets close to what you wanna do, or use an off the shelf device like a Hololens, or Magic Leap or something like that, where even though it costs way more than you think it's gonna cost in the future, this is kind of the trick. Overspend in the early days. Like spend more money that you have in order to get that first test done, if it's possible. If you don't have any money, then I guess you can't. But if you have a little bit of money, spend that 400 dollars to get an Oculus, so that you can simulate the experience in VR before you actually go and make the hardware.

-所以你的问题是，我们有一个非常复杂的产品，人工智能心理治疗师？或者能帮助人们的治疗师。我们怎么演示呢？或者我们如何将产品传达给人们？我敢猜测，这是一个类似于最后一个问题的问题，比如，我们有办法在软件而不是硬件上做到这一点吗？所以如果我在做这样的项目，我可能会首先创建一个应用程序的助手，或者像一个3D的统一角色，接近它，接近你想做的事情，或者使用一个现成的设备，比如Hololens，或者MagicLeap之类的，即使它的价格比你想象的要高得多，但这是一种诡计。早年超支。比如，如果可能的话，花更多的钱来完成第一次测试。如果你没有钱，我想你不能。但如果你有一点钱，花400美元买一个Oculus，这样你就可以在虚拟现实中模拟体验，然后再去制作硬件。

- [Audience Member] If you're thinking about building the company. You have the product/market fit, from your own revenues and profits, and potentially getting loans from banks and things like that scale?

-[观众]如果你在考虑建立公司你有产品/市场适合，从你自己的收入和利润，潜在的贷款从银行和诸如此类的规模？

- So I think I would actually go one step above that and understand why hardware companies need financing. Usually it's for inventory. It's rare that a company will need to get funding for, I guess it's not rare, there's like funding for inventory, and there's funding for R and D. Funding for R and D is like, you need that. You can either get it through pre payments from potential customers. That's harder, but most people try to raise R and D funding from people like YC, or other investors. Banks will not lend you money for R and D. Your family might. So I would try to reduce that as much as possible. Try to spend as little money as possible, hacking together, prototyping, getting to the point where you know what product you're gonna build.
Then on the inventory financing side, here's the thing that I've learned. Inventory sucks. Inventory is one of the hardest things that hardware companies have to deal with. Because they can't make money, generally, until they have a product that they need to sell. It costs money to build that product, and it costs time to build that product, so you have what's called a cash conversion cycle where you may need to put inputs, dollars, into your product in order to get outputs down the road. Again, it is impossible, it is very difficult to manage inventory. So the better thing is actually to rise above it, and to get into a situation where you don't need to buy as much inventory.
There's two ways that you can do this. One is you can get customers to pre order. That's the easiest way, because then you have a very perfect idea of how many units you need to build. So that you can, and you can use that money from pre orders to actually fund the development. You don't need to raise money from VCs. You don't need to raise money from banks. That doesn't work always, but it does work in some crazy situations, like Xiaomi up until two or three years ago, sold their phones on Tuesday mornings. Like you couldn't go on the website and buy Xiaomi phones. You could only buy them Tuesday mornings, and so it was like a thing. Everyone would be at their computers on Tuesday mornings waiting for the latest drop of Xiaomi phones.
And they had a really short production cycle, like not a week, but they knew basically based on these Tuesday sales how many units they'd need to make over the next couple of weeks. OnePlus also did the same thing. So that's one way of doing it, the pre order route.
The other way is to change your product so that it takes a shorter amount of time to build. This is called reducing the lead times. So the benefit, the secret benefit of reducing your lead times is that you have to put less of your hard earned cash into inventory that will then take months to turn into actual revenue, so interestingly enough, sometimes it's in your best interest to pay more for the product, pay more for the BOM, the building materials. Pay more for the components, if the lead times are shorter. Because you may not actually have a margin problem. Maybe you actually have quite a bit of margin, free margin, but you have this cashflow problem, where you can't fund new batches of products because it takes six months to turn that product into revenue. So you could take some of the margin, you could do a trade off where you earn less profit per unit, but you're taking less of a risk up front. That's kind of the general learnings that I've had around how to do hardware financing.

因此，我认为我实际上会超越这一步，理解为什么硬件公司需要融资。通常是为了库存。一家公司很少需要资金，我想这并不少见，就像库存资金，还有研发资金，研发资金就像你需要的那样。你可以通过潜在客户的预付费获得它。这很难做到，但大多数人都试图从YC或其他投资者那里筹集研发资金。银行不会借钱给你，你的家人可能会借钱给你。所以我会尽量减少。尽量少花钱，黑客，原型制作，达到你知道你要生产什么产品的地步。在库存融资方面，我学到了一些东西。存货糟透了。库存是硬件公司必须处理的最困难的事情之一。因为他们不可能赚钱，一般情况下，直到他们有一个产品，他们需要出售。建造这个产品需要花费金钱，所以你有一个所谓的现金转换周期，你可能需要在你的产品中投入，美元，这样你才能得到产品的产出。再一次，这是不可能的，很难管理库存。因此，更好的办法实际上是超越它，进入一种情况下，你不需要购买那么多的库存。有两种方法可以做到这一点。一个是你可以让顾客预先订购。这是最简单的方法，因为你有一个非常完美的想法，你需要建造多少单位。所以你可以，你可以用预购的钱来为开发提供资金。你不需要从风投那里筹到钱。你不需要向银行筹集资金。这并不总是起作用，但在一些疯狂的情况下，比如小米，直到两三年前，他们的手机在周二早上才开始销售。就像你不能在网站上买小米手机一样。你只能在星期二早上买，所以就像一件事。周二早上，每个人都会在电脑前等待小米手机的最新下降。他们有一个很短的生产周期，就像一个星期，但他们基本上知道根据这些星期二的销售，他们需要多少单位，在未来几周。OnePlus也做了同样的事情。所以这是一种方法，预定路线。另一种方法是改变您的产品，使它需要更短的时间来构建。这叫做缩短周转时间。所以好处，减少你的筹备时间的秘密好处是，你必须把你辛苦赚来的现金中更少的投入到库存中，然后花上几个月的时间才能转化成实际的收入。所以很有趣的是，有时候花更多的钱购买产品，花更多的钱购买BOM，建筑材料，这对你来说是最有利的。如果准备时间较短，则为组件支付更多的费用。因为你可能没有实际的保证金问题。也许你实际上有相当多的保证金，但你有现金流问题，你不能资助新的产品批次，因为它需要六个月的时间才能将产品转化为收入。因此，你可以拿一些保证金，你可以做一个交易，你的单位利润较少，但你是承担较少的风险前。这是我对如何进行硬件融资的一般认识。
