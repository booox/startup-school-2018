# A Conversation on Hard Tech with Eric Migicovsky

#与Eric Migicovsky谈硬技术

Adora Cheung: Welcome.

张朵拉：欢迎。

We have Eric here today. Eric is a YC Partner. He was previously the CEO and Founder of Pebble, which went through the YC Batch in all the way winter of 2011.

埃里克今天来了。埃里克是YC的合伙人。他以前是Pe球公司的首席执行官和创始人，该公司在2011年的整个冬天都经历了YC的生产。

Eric Migicovsky: A long long time ago.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：很久以前。

Adora Cheung: You're an old man Eric.

张爱多拉：你是个老人，埃里克。

Eric Migicovsky: Exactly. So now we have the other building on the other side but, YC Batch was one of the last ones in this small small building.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：没错。所以现在我们在另一边有另一座建筑，但是，YC批次是这座小建筑中最后的一座。

Adora Cheung: Yeah. You actually ...

张朵拉：是的。你实际上.。

I t was called Alerta, when applied?

它被叫做Alerta，当它被应用的时候？

Eric Migicovsky: Yup, and our product was called InPulse.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的，我们的产品叫做InPulse。

Adora Cheung: InPulse?

张朵拉：脉诊？

Eric Migicovsky: Yes.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的。

We hd a whole bunch of complicated names.

我们有一大堆复杂的名字。

Adora Cheung: I mean Pebbles' a great name. How did you end up with that?

张朵拉：我是说鹅卵石是个很棒的名字。你怎么会有这样的结果？

Eric Migicovsky: How did I get to a much better name?

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：我是怎么得到一个更好的名字的？

Adora Cheung: Yeah.

张朵拉：是的。

Eric Migicovsky: You go through a lot of worse names on the way.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：你在路上经历了很多更糟糕的名字。

I think the original names were found using a thesaurus or some sort of like, we just like scanned through a book of words that were related to alerting, Alerta, that's how we got to it originally. Pebble was a much better name.

我认为最初的名字是用辞典或者类似的东西找到的，我们就像扫描一本与提醒有关的单词，Alerta，这就是我们最初是如何找到它的。鹅卵石是个更好的名字。

I actually thought of it while lying on a beach and it was like two years before we actually made Pebble and I just wrote it down in Evernote on a list of good names. You have no idea when you're gonna use another name so if you think of any good ones, you just write it down.

我在海滩上躺着的时候想到了这件事，就在两年前我们才做了鹅卵石，我只是把它写在Evernote上的一个好名字列表上。你不知道什么时候你会用另一个名字，所以如果你想到好的名字，你就把它写下来。

Adora Cheung: So today I want to spend a little time talking about hardware start-ups given you ran one, especially one that was one of the larger hardware start-ups in the past few years, but then spend the bulk of the time talking about Hard Tech because you've spent a lot of time working with Hard Tech or T-tech or whatever we want to call it.

张朵拉：所以今天我想花点时间讨论一下硬件初创企业，尤其是过去几年中规模更大的硬件初创企业之一但是大部分时间都花在谈论硬技术上，因为你花了很多时间在高科技或者我们想叫它的任何东西上。

Eric Migicovsky: Here at YC.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：在YC。

Adora Cheung: ... Here at YC and there are a lot of unknowns still out there and we obviously want to find more of those kind of start-ups. So starting with Pebble, can you take us through a quick story of when you came to YC? How big were you? What did you do in YC? That's actually a common question of what hardware start-ups actually do in three months.

张朵拉：.。在YC，还有很多未知数，我们显然想找到更多这样的初创公司。所以从鹅卵石开始，你能带我们看看你什么时候来YC的故事吗？你有多大？你在YC做了什么？实际上，这是一个常见的问题，即硬件初创公司在三个月内实际会做什么。

Eric Migicovsky: We applied to YC, we started the company in 2008, started working on it while I was still a student at Waterloo. Kept working on it through 2010.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：我们申请了YC，我们在2008年创办了这家公司，在我还在滑铁卢读书的时候就开始了这方面的工作。一直工作到2010年。

We hadn't actually shipped or we were just starting to ship the product to our first customers, this is before Pebble, back in mid 2010 and I'd been on Hacker News forever but I never really understood what YCombinator was, I just thought it was like the domain name for Hacker News, and one day someone said, "Hey, you should check out YC." So just on a whim we applied.

我们实际上并没有发货，或者我们刚刚开始向我们的第一批客户发货，这是在Pe球之前，早在2010年中期，我就一直在Hacker News上，但我从来没有真正理解YCombinator是什么，我只是觉得它就像黑客新闻的域名，有一天有人说，“嘿，你应该看看YC。”所以我们只是一时冲动申请了。

Th e video we recorded, if I look back at it, was during Oktoberfest in [inaudible] where I was living and we were wearing Oktoberfest hats in the video.

这是我们录制的视频，如果我回头看的话，是在啤酒节期间，我住在那里，我们在视频中戴着啤酒节的帽子。

We applied for some crazy reason Paul Graham and Jessica and the gang decided to accept us even though, I think we were the third hardware company that dropped through.

我们申请的原因很疯狂，保罗·格雷厄姆和杰西卡决定接受我们，尽管我认为我们是第三家通过的硬件公司。

We started YC in 2011 in the winter and the stage of the company was we had shipped maybe, I think two or three hundred of our very first watch, the watch that was called InPulse that worked with Blackberry Smartphones and we had some great customer, we were getting money, we were earning some money, hadn't raised much.

我们在2011年冬天创立了YC，公司的发展阶段是我们可能已经发运了，我认为这是我们第一款手表的二三百块，这款名为InPulse的手表与黑莓智能手机一起工作，我们有了一些优秀的客户，我们得到了钱，我们赚了一些钱，但没有筹到多少钱。

I think I borrowed $15,000 thousand bucks from my parents, got some government grants in Canada which was quite easy, but we hadn't raised any money from investors. YC was the first investor.

我想我向我的父母借了1.5万美元，在加拿大得到了一些政府赠款，这很容易，但我们没有从投资者那里筹集到任何资金。YC是第一个投资者。

Adora Cheung: So $15,000 thousand dollars let you manufacture, was it the first 100 units?

张朵拉：所以你可以花一万五千美元来制造，这是第一批100台吗？

Eric Migicovsky: We ended up making them one by one actually. SO the first watch, they were manufactured, we bought the circuit boards from China, we had the metal, the kind of metal casing of the watch made at a small metal shop.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：实际上，我们最终是一个接一个地把它们做成的。所以第一只手表，是制造出来的，我们从中国买了电路板，我们有金属，一家小金属商店制造的那种手表的金属外壳。

I guys had a CNC, a five-access CNC mill and he actually read about us in the school newspaper or something like that and offered to be our first shop for making the actual metal cases. So metal case would get made a couple of blocks away.

我的人有一个CNC，一个五通道的数控磨坊，他在校报或类似的报纸上读到了我们的故事，并主动提出要成为我们制造实际金属盒的第一家商店。所以金属盒会在几个街区外制造。

We get the circuit boards shipped in from China.

我们从中国运来的电路板。

We also made the plastic watchstraps in China and then we would do the final assembly one by one in the garage.

我们还在中国制造了塑料表带，然后在车库里一个接一个地组装。

I think that early process of making everything one by one was perfect for us because we screwed up everything that you could possibly screw up in the first 10 watches.

我认为一个接一个地制作所有东西的早期过程对我们来说是完美的，因为我们把所有你可能会在前10块表中搞砸的东西都搞砸了。

We had a lot of problems.

我们遇到了很多问题。

We had a problem with our app.

我们的应用程序出了问题。

We couldn't get the signal out of the watch because it's like a Faraday cage sitting on your wrist.

我们无法从手表上得到信号，因为它就像坐在你手腕上的法拉第笼子。

An d so we said, "Well maybe lets change the metal back for a plastic back?" So we had a whole bunch of laser cut acrylic, you know, plastic cut to the same size of the back of the watch.

于是我们说，“也许我们换个金属回来换个塑料背吧？”所以我们用了一整束激光切割丙烯酸，你知道，塑料切割到了和手表背面一样大的尺寸。

We kind of jammed it in and then we shipped the first 10 of them out by FedEx on something like 7 or the 10, the electronics exploded out the back of the plastic and people would show us pictures of this watch that they just bought with the guts just everywhere and so we adjusted the thing.

我们把它塞进去，然后由联邦快递(FedEx)把前10只装在7或10上，电子产品从塑料的背面爆炸，人们会给我们看他们用内脏买的手表的照片，所以我们调整了它。

We started putting a piece of foam rubber inside the watch when we shipped it so that the back wouldn't explode. But it was a really good thing that we were making them one by one or else we could have potentially made hundreds with that same problem right at the beginning and had lost basically everything.

当我们把一块泡沫橡胶装进手表的时候，我们开始把它放进去，这样它的背面就不会爆炸了。但这是一件非常好的事情，我们让他们一个，否则，我们可能已经制造了数百个与相同的问题，在开始时，基本上已经失去了一切。

I think we iterated really quickly and when we screwed up it was only a maximum of like a pretty small screw up.

我认为我们的迭代速度非常快，当我们搞砸的时候，它只是一个非常小的错误的最大值。

Adora Cheung: How many units had you sold before you actually went through the entire manufacturing process?

张朵拉：在你完成整个生产过程之前，你卖出了多少台？

Eric Migicovsky: We continued to manufacture hand-by-hand, one-by-one by hand, up until around 700, 800 units.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：我们继续手工生产，一个接一个，直到700，800台。

Adora Cheung: Wow.

张朵拉：哇。

Eric Migicovsky: One of the things that people ask often about YC is, "What happens if I have to move my business to Mountain View? Its gonna interrupt my production process or whatever." So what we did was I hired a couple of high school students and I asked one of my friends who I went to school with who was doing his Masters back at Waterloo, to just kind of manage and run the production thing and they would ship them down here and we would finish it in our house that we were all living in. So I think the trick there was we didn't let's the fact that we had to be here in Mountain View interrupt our actual sales process.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基(Eric Migicovsky)：人们经常问YC的一件事是：“如果我不得不把业务搬到山景城去，会发生什么？它会打断我的生产过程或什么的。”所以我们雇了几个高中生，我问我的一个朋友，我和谁一起上学，他在滑铁卢做他的硕士，只是管理和经营生产，他们会把他们运到这里，我们会在我们住的房子里完成。所以我认为我们的诀窍是，我们没有让我们不得不在山景城打断我们的实际销售过程这一事实。

Adora Cheung: So afterwards I see Pebble obviously took off and lots of great things happened.

张朵拉：所以之后，我看到鹅卵石明显地起飞了，许多伟大的事情发生了。

I mean you went through lots of ups and downs-

我是说，你经历了很多起起落落-

Eric Migicovsky: It was a year after Waterloo, it wasn't like immediately after.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：那是滑铁卢事件后的一年，而不是紧接着。

I t took a long time.

花了很长时间。

Adora Cheung: ... So what was the hardest part maybe out of your whole journey with Pebble?

张朵拉：.。那么，在你和鹅卵石的整个旅程中，最困难的部分是什么呢？

Eric Migicovsky: Looking back I think it's different because seeing it forward, it actually took us a long time to get from the initial idea to any sort of real product market fit.

Eric Migicovsky：回顾过去，我认为这是不同的，因为展望未来，我们花了很长时间才从最初的想法到任何一种真正的产品市场适合。

I t was five years. So we started the company in 2008. Built the initial prototype late 2008-2009. Didn't start shipping until 2010 and that was for our first watch and then we had a lot of lessons learned from that first production run and then we redesigned and created what would become Pebble in 2012. So that's five years. The hardest thing, I mean I would say we worked with a lot of founders, and the hardest question that I think I ever get as someone who helped start-ups is how do I know that what I'm working on is the right thing to work on? How do I know that this little pivot that I could do is not the right one, like maybe I should try that.

那是五年。所以我们在2008年创办了这家公司。2008至2009年底建造了最初的原型。直到2010年才开始发货，这是我们的第一只手表，然后我们从第一次生产中吸取了很多经验教训，然后我们重新设计并创建了将在2012年成为鹅卵石的产品。那就是五年了。最难的是，我的意思是，我们和很多创始人一起工作，而作为一个帮助创业的人，我最难回答的问题是，我怎么知道我正在做的事情是正确的？我怎么知道我能做的这个小支点不是正确的，也许我应该试试。

An d there's no answer to this.

这件事没有答案。

I t is the hardest problem. So thinking back, I think it was probably very misguided in that I just had faith and I just never gave up even though now thinking back it's insane doing something for five years. Like, what is the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing and hoping for different results.

这是最难的问题。所以回想起来，我认为这可能是非常误导，因为我只是有信心，我只是从来没有放弃，即使现在回想起来，这是疯狂的做了五年的事情。精神错乱的定义是什么？做同样的事情，希望得到不同的结果。

I was basically doing that for five years.

我已经做了五年了。

I guess we didn't know what we didn't know.

我想我们不知道什么。

We were very naïve and we had a very small amount of money and we didn't know that you're not suppose to make consumer hardware products on a budget of $40,000 thousand dollars. Most electronics that you use are made with budgets of millions of dollars.

我们非常天真，我们有一小部分钱，我们不知道你不应该在4万美元的预算中生产消费硬件产品。你使用的大多数电子产品都是用数百万美元的预算制作的。

Adora Cheung: But now that you've done it or you did do it, do you think it's possible now?

张：但是现在你已经做了或者你做了，你认为现在有可能吗？

Eric Migicovsky: Its totally possible. What I'm saying is that I think that the hardest part that we had to go through was not letting other people get us down and kind of maintaining that naivety. One of the things that I really love about that phase of the start-up was people couldn't really convince us that what we were doing was wrong because no one had really done it before and if people said, "Oh, you should look at raising more money." Or something like that we really didn't have the resources to do that.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：完全有可能。我的意思是，我认为我们必须经历的最困难的部分是不要让别人让我们失望，并保持这种天真。我最喜欢创业阶段的一件事是，人们无法真正说服我们，我们所做的是错误的，因为以前没有人真的这么做过，如果人们说，“哦，你应该考虑筹集更多的资金。”或者类似的事情，我们真的没有足够的资源去做这件事。

We were a very constrained naïve team and so we had to figure it out and I think some of the ways I could have screwed it up was, actually the ways that I did screw it up was right after YC we raised a bit of money, about $250,000 thousand dollars including this kind of large check that we got from one investor and I took all that money and invested it in inventory because I thought at the time the biggest constraint on us growing was we didn't have a reliable, we didn't have a large amount of inventory.

我们是一个非常天真的团队，所以我们必须弄清楚，我可能会搞砸的一些方法是，实际上，我搞砸它的方式是在YC之后，我们筹集了一些钱，大约25万美元，包括我们从一个投资者那里得到的这么大的支票，我把所有的钱都投入到库存中，因为当时我认为我们增长的最大限制是我们没有可靠的，我们没有大量的存货。

We were making them by hand so we only had 10 or 50 a week and I was under the mistaken impression that if we could start selling it in real time rather than saying we'll do it pre order and sale it to you in a couple of weeks, that our sales would have taken off more because then we tried this, we manufactured instead of making them by hand in our garage we went to a small contract manufacturing in San Jose and manufactured 3000 at once and spent all of our money on that.

我们是手工制作的，所以我们每周只有10到50美元，而我有一种错误的印象，如果我们能开始实时销售，而不是说我们会在几周内预先订购并出售给你，我们的销售会增长更多，因为那时我们尝试了这个，我们不是在车库里手工制造，而是在圣何塞签订了一份小合同，一次制造了3000辆，并把我们所有的钱都花在了这上面。

I 'll see that the stories going, it takes longer than you expect to bring up a new manufacturer. So it took six months or eight months instead of three months.

我会看到故事发生，比你想象中的要花更长的时间，所以花了六个月或八个月，而不是三个月。

I t cost more than we expected so the [inaudible] cost rose and then by the time that we actually manufactured them, that eight months rolled around our email list of potential customers had kind of dried up. Everyone had switched from Blackberry to using iPhones and then we were stuck with a whole bunch of inventory. So that was a really rough difficult part.

它的成本并不比我们预期的高，所以(听不见的)成本上升了，然后当我们实际生产它们的时候，我们的电子邮件列表上的潜在客户已经干涸了八个月。每个人都从黑莓转向使用iPhone，然后我们就陷入了一大堆库存。所以这是一个非常困难的部分。

Adora Cheung: It's often, not always, but in many cases people get really creative when they don't have much money and they have to get really scrappy and then when they raise a ton of money they forget how to do that.

张朵拉：这经常，但在很多情况下，当他们没有很多钱的时候，他们会变得很有创造力，他们必须变得非常暴躁，然后当他们筹集到一大笔钱时，他们就会忘记如何去做。

Eric Migicovsky: It happened to me again three years later.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：三年后又发生在我身上。

We raised a bunch of money and then started hiring and this is a big problem that even mostly the successful companies run into. So I think the moral of the story for me at least how I think about projects that I work on is that frugality is vital to me. Not everyone has the same and not every industry is exactly the same.

我们筹集了大量资金，然后开始招聘，这是一个大问题，即使是大多数成功的公司也会遇到。所以我认为这个故事的寓意-至少我是如何看待我所从事的项目-节俭对我来说是至关重要的。并不是每个人都有相同的，也不是每个行业都是完全一样的。

Th ere's a few crazy industries right now which are kind of by definition the opposite of frugal. I'm thinking of the scooter, scooter [inaudible] phase, where it's like a matter of raising as much money as physically possible but for the vast majority of people staying frugal is what actually like ...

现在有几个疯狂的行业，从定义上来说，它们与节俭是相反的。我想到的是滑板车，滑板车(听不见的)阶段，这就像在身体上筹集尽可能多的钱一样，但对于绝大多数人来说，节俭才是真正喜欢的。

Adora Cheung: Yeah.

张朵拉：是的。

I f you don't have obvious network affects or first mover advantage then usually you should get on the other path. So Pebbles' known as one of the most successful Crowdfunding Campaigns on KickStarter. A lot of people view Crowdfunding as a way in loo of fundraising to do that route. So I think there are a lot of questions on when is the right time to do it? Especially like at what point do I need a product that is real and it works do I need to align that with the Crowdfunding campaign and so forth? What is your advice on that?

如果你没有明显的网络影响或先发制人优势，那么通常你应该走上另一条道路。因此，Pebbles被称为Kickstarter上最成功的众筹活动之一。很多人认为众筹是一种融资途径。所以我认为有很多问题是关于什么时候做这件事的合适时机？特别是在什么时候，我需要一个真实的产品，它能工作吗？我需要把它和众筹运动结合起来吗？你对此有什么建议？

Eric Migicovsky: After having gone through a couple of these cycles, here's my advice.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：在经历了几次这样的循环之后，下面是我的建议。

I think Crowdfunding can be useful for two specific points, mainly useful for two specific points in start-ups. You could use Crowdfunding at the very early stage when you have an idea on the back of a napkin, maybe a render or two to raise $25 $50,000 thousand dollars that can help you get to a working prototype.

我认为众筹对两个具体点是有用的，主要是对初创企业的两个特定点有用。你可以在很早期的时候使用众筹，当你在餐巾纸的背面有了一个想法，也许一两块钱来筹集25万美元，可以帮助你得到一个工作的原型。

Th is is for people who are software engineers and are experimenting or want to work with hardware.

这是为软件工程师，并正在试验或希望与硬件工作的人。

Th is is for hardware engineers who have zero money and they just want to prove that some people want their product. So I want to be very specific.

这是给没有钱的硬件工程师的，他们只是想证明一些人想要他们的产品。所以我想说得非常具体。

Th is is an intention play. Its not trying to build a multi-million dollar campaign with super fancy CGI graphics and overproduced videos.

这是一个意图游戏。它不想用超级花哨的CGI图形和过多的视频制作数百万美元的广告。

I 'm talking about people honestly saying, "I just need a little bit of money to get this idea off the ground." And I think there's an opportunity to use Crowdfunding right there.

我指的是人们诚实地说，“我只是需要一点钱来实现这个想法。”我认为这里有一个利用众筹的机会。

I t could be as emailing a bunch of you friends and saying, "Hey, do you wanna just, do you want one of these?" This is like the best test that you can have for early product market fit is do your friends and family actually pay you money for what you're making? Do earlier customers actually pre-pay for what you're making? It's not perfect because they may want to try it first or something like that but if you are making something that people really want they're basically throwing their money at you. So that's an opportunity for kind of this early Crowdfunding.

我可以给你们一群朋友发电子邮件，说：“嘿，你想要这些吗？”这就像你在早期产品市场上所能做的最好的测试：你的朋友和家人是否真的为你赚的钱付钱？以前的顾客是否真的为你的收入预付了钱？这并不完美，因为他们可能想先试一试，或者诸如此类的东西，但如果你要做的是人们真正想要的东西，他们基本上是在向你扔钱。因此，这是一个机会，为这种早期的众筹。

I really encourage people to not try to do the marketing blow-out campaign at the start for two reasons. One is just looking back, most of those campaigns, even if they do succeed at raising money, usually fail to produce and actually ship their product.

我真的鼓励人们不要在一开始就尝试做市场推广活动，原因有二。其中之一就是回顾一下，这些活动中的大多数，即使它们确实成功地筹集到了资金，通常也无法生产和实际运送它们的产品。

An d I think the reason why is going through the cycle of having to make something and ship it to customers is really educational and you also learn what people like about your product or what they don't like as quickly as like you reduce the amount of time between you having the idea and you getting validation of do people actually want this idea. So that's the first I think opportunity for crowdfunding.

我认为，为什么要制造某种东西并将其运送给客户的循环过程是很有教育意义的，你也可以了解人们对你的产品喜欢什么，或者他们不喜欢什么，就像你减少你的想法和你得到验证之间的时间一样快，人们真的想要这个想法吗？。所以我认为这是第一次获得众筹的机会。

I think there's actually another opportunity using it more of as a marketing and sales channel, which that I think more of what we did where we had already made, most people don't know this, but when we launched out Kickstarter Campaign, we had already made and sold around 1500 of our first watch. So we had gone through all of the pain and the cycle of building that and we had a really good idea of what Pebble should look like because we had feedback from about 1500 individuals who were super eager early adopters, very open with their feedback and we tuned and tweaked the product. So I think there's a kind of like two separate Crowdfunding opportunities in a consumers products lifecycle.

我认为实际上还有另一个机会更多地利用它作为营销和销售渠道，我认为我们在我们已经做过的事情上做了更多的事情，大多数人不知道，但是当我们发起Kickstarter活动时，我们已经制作并销售了大约1500块我们的第一只手表。所以我们经历了所有的痛苦和构建的循环，我们对Peble应该是什么样子有一个很好的认识，因为我们有来自1500名非常热心的早期采用者的反馈，他们的反馈非常开放，我们调整和调整了产品。因此，我认为在消费者产品生命周期中有两种独立的众筹机会。

I think too often people blend them together or they don't know which path they're on and so they kind of screw it up. There's actually a couple of other platforms for this early Crowdfunding, there's Kickstarter and Indiegogo and that kind of thing, but there's also TenD, there's Crowdsupply, theirs like Hackaday Forums. There's a lot of really niche areas where you could, you could go to a discord server and say, "Who wants to buy ..." Like you don't have to use the big Kickstarter platforms for kind of that early phase.

我觉得人们经常把它们混在一起，或者他们不知道自己走的是哪条路，所以他们搞砸了。事实上，这个早期的众筹还有另外几个平台，有Kickstarter和Indiegogo之类的，但也有趋势，有CrowdSupply，他们的类似Hackaday论坛。有很多真正适合你的领域，你可以到一个不和谐的服务器上说，“谁想买.”就像你不需要在早期阶段使用大型的Kickstarter平台一样。

Adora Cheung: Do you suggest having a date in which I can promise you I can actually deliver this? 'Cause if I'm using Kickstarter with the first route, maybe I don't know that I can deliver it within six months.

张朵拉：你是否建议有一个约会，我可以向你保证，我可以实际交付这个？因为如果我在第一条路线上使用Kickstarter，也许我不知道我能在六个月内交付它。

I s there a certain time period in which I know I can deliver then I do that?

在一定的时间里，我知道我可以送货，然后我就这么做了？

Eric Migicovsky: Yeah.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的。

I would encourage that if you're not confident your ability to ship it, then don't use one of these Crowdfunding platforms where it's very shipping centric, there's other options. And again, I really do encourage going through that first cycle to find out things like, how long does it take me to make things? Do I have all the skills on my team or do I actual have to find people potentially in the community to help contribute software or other skills to the team? Again, too many people I see they skip that step and they try to go directly to high-powered marketing campaign and it's just such a sad time most of the time.

我想鼓励的是，如果你对你的运输能力没有信心，那就不要使用那些以航运为中心的众筹平台，还有其他的选择。再一次，我真的鼓励通过第一个周期来找出一些东西，比如，我要花多长时间才能做东西？我是否拥有团队中的所有技能，或者我是否需要在社区中找到潜在的人来帮助为团队贡献软件或其他技能？再一次，我看到太多的人，他们跳过了这一步，他们试图直接进行高效率的营销活动，而大多数时候，这只是一个悲伤的时刻。

Adora Cheung: And sometimes there's a group, we try to go after the group before the early adopters, 'cause on Kickstarter those are kind of early adopters but there's a group before that.

张阿多拉：有时候会有一个群体，我们试图在早期采用者之前追踪这个群体，因为在Kickstarter上，他们是一些早期采用者，但在那之前有一个群体。

Eric Migicovsky: Exactly. Exactly, and I think for your given industry and for your given product category you should be able to it. Sometimes it's as simple as going on a [inaudible] .

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：没错。没错，我认为对于你的特定行业和你的特定产品类别，你应该能够做到这一点。有时它就像去一个[听不到的]东西一样简单。

We've had some great companies come through YC and they do their initial sales just by earning credibility in a Facebook group or they earn credibility in Reddit group or Discord.

我们已经有一些伟大的公司通过YC，他们做他们的初始销售仅仅是通过在一个Facebook集团中获得信誉，或者他们在Reddit集团或不和中获得信誉。

Th ere's a ton of customers there.

那里有很多顾客。

Adora Cheung: So when you talked about Pebble earlier, you talked about hiring people and outsourcing things. What's the right call in terms of outsourcing the various components?

张朵拉：那么，当你之前谈到鹅卵石的时候，你谈到了雇佣人员和外包的事情。从外包各种组件的角度来看，什么才是正确的选择？

Eric Migicovsky: This is a really hard question for Hard Tech companies because more often than not, the skillsets that you'll need to build your products are actually quite varied. You may need a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, a computer engineer, some production people, OPS people, and you don't necessarily need 100% of that person all the time, you need 15% or 20% for three weeks and then your back to not needing an electrical engineer. So the best way to solve this is to have really flexible technical people on your team where you guys can just kind of incorporate everything and just do it yourself because those teams move so much faster than teams that require an external kind of process. Some of the most painful moments of my early career were not having full time co-founders and having to work with contractors or consultants who honestly like you can't pay someone enough to care.

EricMigicovsky：对于高科技公司来说，这是一个非常棘手的问题，因为通常情况下，构建产品所需的技能实际上是多种多样的。你可能需要一个机械工程师，一个电气工程师，一个计算机工程师，一些生产人员，OPS人员，你不一定总是需要100%的人，你需要15%或20%的三周，然后你的背部不需要一个电气工程师。所以解决这个问题的最好方法是在你的团队里有非常灵活的技术人员，你们可以把所有的事情都整合起来，自己去做，因为这些团队的移动速度比需要外部流程的团队要快得多。我早期职业生涯中的一些最痛苦的时刻是没有全职的联合创始人，不得不与承包商或顾问一起工作，而这些承包商或顾问就像你一样，付不起足够的钱来照顾别人。

I mean firstly because you probably don't have that much money, but also because people who are working on contract, they're just set up to not have same motivations and same alignments of someone whose working 24/7 trying to get their [inaudible 0:18:48] start-up off the ground has. You run into time commitments.

我的意思是，首先，因为你可能没有那么多的钱，但也因为那些在合同上工作的人，他们被设置成没有相同的动机和相同的立场，而那些24小时工作的人试图使他们的[听不见的0：18：48]从地面上起步。你会遇到时间上的承诺。

I just got an email the other day from a Founder who's like, "Yeah our intern went back to school." And he was developing a large portion of our company.

前几天，我收到了一封来自一位创始人的电子邮件，他说：“是的，我们的实习生回到了学校。”他正在开发我们公司的大部分股份。

Adora Cheung: Oh, no.

张朵拉：哦，不。

Eric Migicovsky: So I actually opt for in the early days and pretty much all days, trust and dependability and kind of smartness over very specific deep domain specific knowledge in who I'm looking to hire.

埃里克米基科夫斯基：所以我实际上选择在早期和几乎所有的日子，信任和可靠性，以及某种聪明，在非常具体的深入领域的具体知识，我想雇用谁。

Adora Cheung: So last question on hardware specifically, there's this common saying or adage or whatever you wanna call it, it's like, "Hardware, you can't just build hardware, you have to have a software component so the scales you could have a subscription service of it instead of just the one off type purchase." How much do you believe in that or what do you think about people who say that all the time?

张朵拉：关于硬件的最后一个问题，有句俗语或谚语，或者你想称之为“硬件，你不能只是构建硬件，你必须有一个软件组件，这样你就可以有一个订阅服务，而不仅仅是一次性的购买。你对此有多少信心，或者你对那些一直这么说的人有什么看法？

Eric Migicovsky: I've been working on, I've been doing a bit of research into this category, this really got me interested right after Pebble because that was some feedback that we often got, "Could you launch a subscription service? Could you have some sort of payment subscription?" And you've heard of product market failure, right? The idea that customers really in a particular market are going after your product.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基(Eric Migicovsky)：我一直在研究这个类别，这真的让我对鹅卵石感兴趣，因为我们经常收到这样的反馈：“你能推出订阅服务吗？你能得到某种付费订阅吗？”你听说过产品市场的失败，对吧？客户在某一特定市场上真正追求你的产品的想法。

I actually think there's something called Business Model Company Fit, where you could have the best product in the world, you could actual have product market fit, but if you have the wrong business model, you're not gonna be able to fund and grow your company over the long term. So it's kind of like an advance thing, you don't need to worry about this if you don't have a product market fit because if you don't have a product market fit you don't have a company. But we ran into a problem pretty soon after we hit product market fit of misunderstanding what was the business model that was gonna drive this company? And I think it's like seven or eight or nine different business models that kind of like lanes that hardware companies or Hard Tech companies can use. From just kind of researching and putting companies into different categories and you have the subscription companies like the Nests or the Drop cams of the world that are selling ring healthy $3 to $10 dollar subscriptions per month. But then you see other companies try to do something similar and it just does not work. So in our case we didn't struggle I think with subscriptions, we experimented with it, it wasn't really gonna work for us, but the way that we screwed it up was, we didn't understand that we were in a hits driven market. Hits driven being, you come up with a consumer product, hopefully it's a hit, it hits that product market fit and people start pulling it out of your hands. Similar to a games company, we didn't realize that we had to be super frugal, super kind of low-budget as we developed the new products and kind of tried to engineer another hit. Our first product was certainly a hit. I don't think we ever reached a stake velocity to a hit with any of our later products and I think if we had built more frugal organization, if we were able to build products cheaper and then launch them and test to see if they were successful and if they were successful, scale it up, ETC.

实际上，我认为有一种叫做商业模式公司的模式，你可以拥有世界上最好的产品，你可以真正拥有产品市场，但是如果你有错误的商业模式，你就无法长期资助和发展你的公司。所以这就像一种预先的事情，如果你没有适合的产品市场，你就不用担心，因为如果你没有适合的产品市场，你就没有公司。但是，在我们进入产品市场后不久，我们就遇到了一个问题，因为我们误解了什么商业模式会驱动这家公司？我认为这就像七八到九种不同的商业模式，类似于硬件公司或硬技术公司可以使用的通道。从一种研究，把公司分成不同的类别，你就会有一些订阅公司，比如鸟巢或世界上的滴滴摄像头，它们每月的售价从3美元到10美元不等。但你会看到其他公司试图做一些类似的事情，但这是行不通的。所以，在我们的例子中，我们没有挣扎-我想在订阅方面，我们尝试过，它并不能真正为我们工作，但是我们把它搞砸的方式是，我们不明白我们处在一个受点击率驱动的市场。点击驱动的存在，你想出一个消费产品，希望它是一个成功，它符合产品市场适合，人们开始把它从你的手中拉出来。就像一家游戏公司一样，我们没有意识到当我们开发新产品并试图设计另一个热门产品时，我们必须非常节俭，超级低成本。我们的第一批产品肯定很受欢迎。我不认为我们对后来的任何产品达到了成功的速度，我想如果我们建立了更节俭的组织，如果我们能够制造出更便宜的产品，然后推出它们，并测试它们是否成功，如果它们成功了，那么就把它们放大等等。

I think we would have had a slightly different outcome.

我想我们会有一个稍微不同的结果。

I t kind of goes back to, there are these different models for hardware companies and you need to make sure that your on the right one. You have to question yourself and be like, "Should we really be on a subscription model? Is this really what customers are gonna want? Will they want to spend $5 dollars $10 dollars a month?" And you can't force it, and if you force it like I think we tried to do, you might add extra problems on top of just building great products for your customers.

可以说，对于硬件公司来说，有这些不同的模式，您需要确保您的模式是正确的。你必须扪心自问，“我们真的应该在订阅模式上吗？这真的是顾客想要的吗？他们想每月花5美元10美元吗？”你不能强迫它，如果你像我想的那样强迫它，你可能会增加额外的问题，除了为你的客户建立伟大的产品之外。

Adora Cheung: So pivoting a little bit to Hard Tech, so we funded lots of cool Hard Tech companies lately, Quantum Computing, Self-Driving cars, [inaudible] printing in entire homes so on and so forth-

张朵拉：所以我们把重点转向硬技术，所以我们最近资助了很多酷的硬技术公司，量子计算，自动驾驶汽车，在整个家庭中印刷等等

Eric Migicovsky: Agriculture Technology, yeah.

农业技术，是的。

Adora Cheung: ... Nuclear Vision, Nuclear Fusion.

张朵拉：.。核视觉核聚变。

Eric Migicovsky: Aerospace. Space.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：航空航天。太空。

Adora Cheung: Space. Yes, rockets. Lots of satellites and rockets. So maybe we could calibrate the conversation a little bit. How do you define Hard Tech, D-Tech? What does that really involve?

空间。是的火箭。很多卫星和火箭。所以也许我们可以调整一下谈话。你怎么定义硬技术，高科技？这到底涉及到什么？

Eric Migicovsky: For me I think what I'm excited about in harder technology spaces is the, in the software world the iteration cycles are quite short. You could push code to your repo and have it go live within seconds and so you could rapidly iterate on your product and get feedback from your customers, I think Hard Tech companies can't.

EricMigicovsky：对我来说，在更困难的技术领域，我感到兴奋的是，在软件世界里，迭代周期很短。您可以将代码推送到回购程序中，并让它在几秒钟内运行，这样您就可以快速地迭代您的产品，并从您的客户那里获得反馈，我认为困难的技术公司无法做到这一点。

Th ey don't have this same rapid iteration cycle.

它没有相同的快速迭代周期。

Th ey either have hardware in the mix which kind of not at that same speed yet, though it is dramatically decreasing the amount of time that each iteration cycle takes, or you might have some sort of fundamental technology that your working on that needs to be developed in order to unlock a new business model or new use-case. Or you might be regulatory, regulatory constrained either in the medical device space, drone space, transportation space, self-driving car space.

它要么有硬件，但速度还不一样，虽然它大大减少了每一个迭代周期所需的时间，或者你可能有一些基本的技术，你的工作需要开发，以打开一个新的业务模型或新的用例。或者你可能在医疗设备空间、无人机空间、交通空间、自动驾驶汽车空间等方面受到监管和监管。

Th ese are all like there're external processes that you can't control that affect your iteration cycle time.

这就好像有一些你无法控制的外部进程会影响你的迭代周期时间。

Adora Cheung: So say I had this crazy idea, something to do with rockets or something insane to most people, normal to me of course-

张朵拉：所以说我有个疯狂的想法，跟火箭有关，或者对大多数人来说是疯狂的，当然，对我来说是正常的-

Eric Migicovsky: Except for Rocket Scientist.

除了火箭科学家。

Adora Cheung: ...

张朵拉：.。

An I have no money, where do I even start? What do I do?

A我没有钱，我从哪里开始呢？我做什么好？

Eric Migicovsky: It doesn't cost that much money to get started these days. You can do something like start-up school where they give you free money to invest in, like if you're working on AR Machine Learning you can use that to get compute credits.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：这些天开始工作不需要那么多钱。你可以做一些像创业学校，他们给你免费的钱投资，比如，如果你在AR机器学习，你可以用它来获得计算学分。

Adora Cheung: Maybe a better question is, what is an MVP?

张：也许一个更好的问题是，什么是MVP？

Eric Migicovsky: For most of these harder tech? For medical devices I think the MVP is successfully peer-reviewed science that supports what your working on, that there's some sort of opportunity here and kind of understanding of what your path to clarence is.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：对于大多数这些更难的技术？对于医疗设备，我认为MVP是成功的同行评审的科学，支持你的工作，有某种机会在这里，并对您的路径克拉伦斯是一种理解。

Th ose are in my opinion I think the best companies because there the ones who have shown that they understand which business model their in and they know what's gonna be taken of them to get to kind of sales, but they don't necessarily have to be too far along that path and I think at that stage investors start to get excited when they see the mating of science in a use-case.

在我看来，我认为是最好的公司，因为有一些公司已经证明他们了解自己所处的商业模式，而且他们知道他们会从中得到什么，以获得某种程度的销售，但他们不一定要走得太远，我认为在那个阶段，当投资者看到科学在用例中的结合时，他们开始兴奋起来。

We've had a bunch of companies that are working on rockets and satellites and propulsion, that kind of thing. For those cases it's usually some sort of sub-set scale representation of what you're working on and customers. So in all cases, even if you're working on regulatory constrained products, having customers either contributing money to you through early contracts or further along on the pilot track, the better.

我们有很多公司致力于火箭、卫星和推进，诸如此类的事情。对于这些情况，它通常是某种子集的规模表示，你正在做什么和客户。因此，在所有情况下，即使你在研发受监管约束的产品，让客户要么通过早期合同为你提供资金，要么继续试点，越好。

I think often times engineers, we love to build things, we don't as much love to sale them. So what I look for in early stage companies is are the founders technically competent and do they understand that they're gonna have to kind of reverse themselves, become sales people or not?

我想很多时候工程师，我们喜欢建造东西，我们不喜欢销售。因此，我在早期公司寻找的是，创始人在技术上是否有能力，他们是否知道，他们将不得不改变自己，成为销售人员？

Adora Cheung: What do find by Demo Day when they're in front of a lot of investors? What is it that you encourage them to accomplish by then? It sounds like there's two paths. Business if you can do sales, there's no regulatory issues to doing sales you should have some paid contracts [inaudible] maybe and then also technical validation like proof that you can actually build this.

张朵拉：当他们在很多投资者面前的时候，在演示日有什么发现？你鼓励他们在那时完成什么？听起来有两条路。如果你能做生意，那么做销售就没有监管问题-你应该有一些付费合同(听不见)-也许还有一些技术验证，比如证明你真的可以建立这样的合同。

Eric Migicovsky: Yeah, and I think too often people convolve these and they say I don't wanna sales until I have something that I can show to them.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的，我想人们经常会把这些东西交给别人，他们说我不想销售，除非我有什么东西可以展示给他们看。

Th at's just not true. Most customers, if you explain that they have a problem and you have a way to solve it, they'll get excited and if they're not excited it's probably a sign that they don't really have a problem that they want to solve.

但事实并非如此。大多数客户，如果你解释他们有问题，你有办法解决，他们会很兴奋，如果他们不兴奋，这可能是他们没有真正想要解决的问题的迹象。

An d so, often times we get companies that come in at the beginning of YC and they say, "Well, we wanna spend the first two months working on improving the prototype and getting it to the point where were proud of it and then we'll do sales in the last month." And we kind of flip that around, like do the sales, hit the pavement, like talk to customers and you'll actually build a better first product for them then if you just built it first and then showed it.

所以，我们经常会有一些公司在YC刚成立的时候就来了，他们说：“嗯，我们想花两个月的时间来改进这个原型，让它达到一个让我们为之自豪的程度，然后我们将在最后一个月进行销售。”我们把这个转变过来，比如做销售，在人行道上，和顾客交谈，你实际上会为他们制造一个更好的第一产品，如果你先建造它，然后展示它的话，你就会为他们做一个更好的第一产品。

Adora Cheung: It also gives you confidence that your going down the right track, if someone gives you-

张朵拉：如果有人给你的话，这也会给你信心，让你走在正确的轨道上-

Eric Migicovsky: And it's hard.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：这很难。

We had a company in the last batch that had been working for two years on building a prototype.

我们有一家公司，在最后一批，已经工作了两年的工作，以建立一个原型。

Th ey were commercializing some technology that they worked on in the university and it had a hardware component and I remember seeing, I think it was their second or third application to YC and they had kind of similar videos of them doing the demo with their technology and we liked their commitment, they had been coming back and their technology was getting better and they were just starting to talk to customers and we said, "Lets give them a shot." So we brought them in for an interview, accepted them in, and then basically the first week we took them aside and just said, "You need to start selling. You need to get people excited and interested." And it was almost a 180 for them because they thought that we were gonna say, "You should work on the technology and get to the point where you have working units, widgets that you can sell." And we said, "No. Start going and talking to customers." It took a little while for them to get up to speed, it's like excersizing a new muscle especially for engineers and within the span of two months they went through several roller coasters of having zero leads to having a whole bunch of leads to having them all collapse and no ones signing, and then probably six or seven weeks into YC, they were like, "We got our first contract." Then they got their second contract and then they got their third and then by Demo Day, they had already lined up four or five million dollars in sales and it all happened in the span of three months because they kind of stopped working necessarily on just building their technology.

这是他们在大学里做的一些技术的商业化，它有一个硬件组件，我记得看到过，我认为这是他们对YC的第二次或第三次应用，他们有类似的视频，他们用他们的技术做演示，我们很喜欢他们的承诺，他们已经回来了，他们的技术越来越好，他们刚刚开始和客户交谈，我们说，“让他们试试吧。”所以我们带他们来面试，接受了他们，然后第一周我们就把他们拉到一边说，“你需要开始销售，你需要让人们兴奋和感兴趣。”这对他们来说几乎是180个，因为他们认为我们会说，“你应该研究这项技术，让你的工作单元，你可以销售的小部件。”我们说：“不，开始和顾客交谈吧。”他们花了一小段时间才能跟上速度，这就像锻炼一条新的肌肉，特别是对工程师们来说。在两个月的时间里，他们经历了几次过山车-“零”-导致一整群人都崩溃了，没有人签名，然后大概在YC的6到7周里，他们就像，“我们拿到了第一份合同。”然后他们得到了他们的第二份合同，然后他们拿到了第三份合同，到了演示日，他们已经排好了四五百万美元的销售额，这一切都发生在三个月的时间里，因为他们停止了仅仅在建立他们的技术上的工作。

Th ey were still working, they had a three or four person team so they were able to split it up, but the focus, the number one goal became, "How do we get sales?"

他还在工作，他们有一个三四个人的团队，所以他们能够分开，但是重点，第一个目标变成，“我们如何获得销售？”

Adora Cheung: You do a lot of trips where you go to schools specifically you talk to scientist and engineers, [inaudible] programs. What is your advice to them to make the job? What should they consider? A lot of them are thinking about commercializing it but maybe they think, I don't know what they think actually. But what is your one-two punch on that?

张朵拉：你经常去学校旅行，特别是和科学家和工程师交谈，(听不见)。你给他们做这份工作的建议是什么？他们应该考虑什么？他们中的很多人都在考虑把它商业化，但也许他们会想，我不知道他们到底在想什么。但你的一二拳是什么？

Eric Migicovsky: Having started my company in a university town versus somewhere here like Silicon Valley, I felt very protected.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基(EricMigicovsky)：我在一个大学城创办公司，而在硅谷这样的地方，我感到非常受保护。

Th ere were a lot of government grants.

在此之前，政府给予了大量的资助。

I was able to raise non-diluted funding, and plus side we were able to to use that funding to work on the project but the down-side was there was no pressure to have some sort of product that customers would pay money for.

我能够筹集到非稀释的资金，另外，我们能够利用这些资金来完成项目，但不利的一面是，没有压力让客户花钱购买某种产品。

I t wasn't really in the DNA of the start-up kind of Eco System that I was in. Most people were in trans with working on their start-up and not necessarily getting to that next stage of building kind of a profitable longer term corp.

它并不是真正的DNA在启动的那种生态系统，我在其中。大多数人都在为自己的初创企业工作，但不一定会进入下一个阶段，即建立一家盈利的长期公司。

An d I think that that's sometimes affects people who are in universities even more because the default is raising money through grants and working on longer term projects, whereas the special case is spinning out a company and actually trying to customers to buy it and I think what I would encourage is like try getting out of your comfort zone, just as an experience or experiment. Don't say that you have to dive in head first with no parachute but if your working on some sort of technology that you think could have some sort of positive business impact like get her into the lab. Go to some conferences, not educational conferences, like corporate sales conferences. Start talking to customers and see what people think.

我认为，这有时会对上大学的人产生更大的影响，因为违约是通过赠款和长期项目筹集资金，而特例是剥离一家公司，试图让客户购买它，我认为我鼓励的是尝试走出你的舒适区，就像一种体验或实验。不要说你必须先在没有降落伞的情况下跳入头部，但是如果你在某种你认为可能会产生积极商业影响的技术上工作，比如让她进入实验室。去参加一些会议，而不是教育会议，比如公司销售会议。开始和顾客交谈，看看人们是怎么想的。

Th at's a start. Hopefully, if your lucky and things are in the right spot, again, customers will be like, "Where's this been all my life? This is amazing.

这是个开始。希望，如果你的幸运和事情在正确的位置，再次，客户会说，“这是我的生活在哪里？这是惊人的。”

Th is is exactly what we've been dreaming of, I can't believe it finally came out of the lab." And that should be the momentum that just pulls you along, but you have to get out to at least try it.

这正是我们一直梦寐以求的，我不敢相信它终于从实验室出来了。“这应该是推动你前进的动力，但你必须至少尝试一下。

Adora Cheung: Say you get to the point where you feel confident you have some amount of interest in your product, but to actually build it you need lots and lots and lots of money. What do you need to show to investors?

张爱多拉：假设你对你的产品有一定的兴趣，但要真正建造它，你需要大量的钱。你需要向投资者展示什么？

Eric Migicovsky: The best companies in my onion are the ones that don't require a ton of money to work on or at least to get to some sort of MVP stage. Kind of like all the advice that YC gives, it's usually applicable to 90% of the companies, and there's always 5% on either side that are in a special case. But even some of the best Hard Tech companies I've seen, they don't have a binary outcome where they need someone to insert $100 million dollars and that's the only thing that can develop a product.

EricMigicovsky：我的洋葱上最好的公司是那些不需要花很多钱去工作，或者至少达到某种MVP阶段的公司。就像YC给出的所有建议一样，它通常适用于90%的公司，而且双方都有5%的公司处于特殊情况下。但即使是我见过的一些最优秀的硬技术公司，他们也没有一个二元的结果，他们需要有人投入1亿美元，而这是唯一能够开发一个产品的东西。

I don't know anything about these companies other than kind of press reports but take kind of magically versus Oculus, right? Magically raised lots of money and spent 11 years working on a product, verses Oculus which raised two million dollars on Kickstarter, shipped an early development kit that was not amazing, but they iterated and they got through, and now the Oculus, the new one that's like $400 bucks doesn't need a computer, it's exactly-

除了新闻报道之外，我对这些公司一无所知，但我对Oculus的对抗有点神奇，对吧？神奇地筹到了很多钱，花了11年的时间在一款产品上工作，它在Kickstarter上募集了200万美元，它提供了一个早期的开发工具包，这并不令人惊讶，但是他们重复了下来，他们通过了，现在的Oculus，新的一款，大约400美元，不需要一台电脑，它正是-

Adora Cheung: Quest.

张朵拉：探索。

Eric Migicovsky: ... Yeah, the Quest.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：.。是的，任务。

Th at's exactly what people are dreaming of now and there gonna have it within six months and they had to go through six seven years of painful iteration but they did it.

这正是人们现在梦寐以求的，在六个月内就会有，他们不得不经历六年痛苦的反复，但他们做到了。

Adora Cheung: So, last question and then well take audience questions. What's an idea, just still curious, What's an idea that sounded so crazy to you when you heard about it, but then when you met the founder and they stepped through everything you were like, "oh, that's not so crazy, this is totally possible."?

张朵拉：最后一个问题，然后回答观众的问题。什么想法，只是仍然好奇，有什么想法听起来很疯狂，当你听到它，但当你遇到创始人，他们踩着你的一切，“哦，这不是那么疯狂，这是完全可能的。”

Eric Migicovsky: Relativity Space.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：相对论空间。

Th at was a company that went through YC four three years ago? Not very long.

这是一家四年前通过YC的公司吗？时间不长。

Th ey wanted to build a 3-D printed rockets.

他想制造3D打印火箭。

Th eir thesis was, it's not actually rocket assemble that costs a lot of money it's the testing phase of integration where if you have hundreds of different systems that have to work perfectly with each other when you assemble and build the final rocket you have to test everything. Slightly different path than SpaceX which is going for the reasonability thing. So their thesis was, if we can 3-D print the entire rocket, from the tip of the exhaust to the motor, to everything in one piece, the integration time is zero because you just printed it. So they're working on this and it was just an idea.

我们的论断是，实际上并不是火箭组装花费了很多钱-这是集成的测试阶段，如果你有数百个不同的系统，当你组装和建造最终的火箭时，它们必须彼此完美地工作，你必须测试所有的东西。与SpaceX的路径略有不同，SpaceX是为了理性的东西。所以他们的论文是，如果我们能三维打印整个火箭，从排气端到马达，再到所有的东西，积分时间是零，因为你刚打印出来。所以他们正在做这件事，这只是一个想法。

I think they did a Hot Fire during YC.

我想他们在YC的时候做了一场大火。

I think they were working on it, I don't know exactly how long they had been working on it for, but yeah, that's a pretty crazy idea and to come through YC, especially to pitch to investors that probably were not all space investors, must have taken some guts, but they did it. They showed off their first 3-D printed rocket.

我想他们是在做这件事，我不知道他们花了多久，但是的，这是一个非常疯狂的想法，通过YC，特别是向可能不是所有太空投资者的投资者推销，肯定需要一些勇气，但是他们做到了。他们展示了他们的第一个3D打印火箭。

Th ey raised early funding off of that. They started work on their larger products and raised a whole bunch more money.

为此提前筹集了资金。他们开始研究更大的产品，筹集了更多的资金。

I think they just raised their BRC just last year.

我想他们去年刚提高了BRC。

Adora Cheung: They also, they worked at previously SpaceX-

张朵拉：他们还在以前的SpaceX公司工作-

Eric Migicovsky: SpaceX.

EricMigicovsky：SpaceX。

Adora Cheung: ... Or New Origin but they didn't have many years of experience so it was kind of actually crazy in the sense also they were extremely young and for this kind of thing to-

张朵拉：.。或者“新起源”，但是他们没有很多年的经验，所以从某种意义上说，这是一种疯狂，而且他们非常年轻，对于这类事情来说-

Eric Migicovsky: Yeah, and people believed in there vision.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的，人们相信这一愿景。

Th ey demonstrated enough I think of what they were working on and I think it was actually interesting, so, I don't want to say too much incase I'm wrong, but I think they were working on the printer first and they were looking for an application for this massive metal 3-D printer that they had built and they found space, I mean it was their background and their passion, so I think that's the one that they took it in, that direction that they took it in.

这充分证明了我想到了他们在做什么，我觉得这很有趣，所以，我不想说太多，以防我错了，但我认为他们首先在研究打印机，他们在寻找他们建造的大型金属3D打印机的应用程序，并找到了空间，我的意思是，这是他们的背景和激情，所以我认为这就是他们接受它的方向。

I see this a lot with people that are working on really cool kind of fundamental technology.

我在很多人身上看到了这一点，他们正在研究一种非常酷的基础技术。

I think PG had a pretty good tweet about this a couple of weeks ago, he said, "If you're in a situation where your building something that's mindblowingly cool and revolutionary, but your finding that customers don't want to buy it, pivot your company so that your actually doing what your customers would have done and just use your pioneering technology to do what they do faster, better, or cheaper, and sale to their customers." And that's kind of I think what Relativity did, is they were building this new 3-D printer and they realized that they could just build rockets with this technology and we will be better than what everyone else is building rockets in that space.

我认为PG几周前在推特上对此做了很好的介绍，他说：“如果你处在这样一种情况下，你的建筑非常酷，很有革命性，但是你发现顾客不想买它，以你的公司为支点，让你真正做你的客户应该做的事情，并利用你的先进技术来做他们所做的更快、更好或更便宜的事情，并向他们的客户销售产品。“这就是我认为相对论所做的，他们正在建造一台新的3D打印机，他们意识到他们可以用这种技术制造火箭，我们将比其他人在那个空间里建造火箭更好。

Adora Cheung: Cool. So questions? You first.
Speaker 3: Speaking of that, we've actually sold cups of coffee for $40 bucks a piece now but were making equipment for coffee shops to eliminate bitterness. Based on the path of pending technology and how do you find those first customers? Like, you did 1500 Pebbles' before you went public, how'd you get the 1-50?

张朵拉：酷。那么问题呢？你先来。讲者3：说到这个，我们现在已经卖了一杯40美元一杯的咖啡，但是我们正在为咖啡店制造消除苦味的设备。基于待定技术的路径，您是如何找到这些第一批客户的？比如，你在上市之前做过1500鹅卵石，你是怎么得到1-50的？

Eric Migicovsky: So, the question was, how do you get your first customers? How do you get 1-50? I talked about this a little bit earlier, some of the best ways is to kind of infiltrate the community of people who you think will want your product. There are an unlimited set of places on the internet where people talk about products and they talk about services.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：那么，问题是，你是如何得到你的第一批顾客的？你怎么得到1-50？我早些时候讨论过这个问题，一些最好的方法是渗透到你认为想要你的产品的人的社区。互联网上有一套无限的场所，人们谈论产品，谈论服务。

Th ey can range from, you know where the WhatsApp guy posted his app first in back in 2009?

你知道WhatsApp的家伙在2009年第一次发布他的应用程序吗？

Adora Cheung: No.

张朵拉：不。

Eric Migicovsky: He posted it on Fire Talk Forums which is like a whole bunch of geeky business people who fly a lot and that's where he posted it.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：他把它发到了火语论坛上，就像一群飞了很多飞机的讨厌的商人，他就是在那里发布的。

Th ink about that as the first kind of usergroup for WhatsApp, it's perfect, right? Its travelers who want to talk to people all around the world who are tired of paying for overpriced SMS bills and it's 2009, so people are just starting to get smartphones and that kind of thing. Perfect. You couldn't have planned it better if you tried. So the best companies are the ones that just kind of get out there. For us we got a lot of press in the early days by talking to bloggers. So I have formed personal relationships with all of the Blackberry bloggers at the time.

作为WhatsApp的第一种用户组，它是完美的，对吧？它的旅行者想要和世界各地那些厌倦了支付价格过高的短信账单的人交谈，现在已经是2009年了，所以人们才刚刚开始买智能手机之类的东西。完美。如果你尝试的话，你不可能有更好的计划。所以，最好的公司就是那些刚刚走出去的公司。对我们来说，在最初的日子里，通过和博主交谈，我们得到了很多媒体的关注。因此，我与当时所有的黑莓博主建立了个人关系。

An yone remembers Crackberry? CrackBerry Kevin? So I would fly out to conferences on dirt cheap red-eyes and instead of buying tickets to the conference, I think we would just kind of sneak around and get into the ... Like once that CES back in 2009, we'd just walked into Ngadgets Trailer. Ngadget had this big trailer where all their reporters were working and we didn't know anyone, so we just walked in and then just started pitching to people and ended up getting his food.

Yone还记得Crackberry吗？克莱贝瑞凯文？所以我会坐着便宜的红眼睛去参加会议，而不是去买会议的门票，我想我们可以偷偷溜进去.。就像2009年CES一样，我们刚刚走进NGadget拖车。NGadget有一个很大的预告片，他们所有的记者都在那里工作，我们不认识任何人，所以我们就走了进来，然后开始向人们推销，最后得到了他的食物。

I t's like a picture of my wrist with a broken watch or it didn't even work at the time, but it's like, "So and so is working on a smartwatch." And that drove a ton of traffic in the early days, was just kind of people self identifying that this was something that I wanted.

这就像我的手腕上有一块坏了的手表，或者当时它甚至不起作用，但它就像，“那么，我的手腕在做一个智能手表。”在早期，这推动了大量的交通，只是让人们自我意识到这是我想要的东西。

Adora Cheung: It takes a lot of hustle for sure. Okay, right here.
Speaker 4: [inaudible] .

张朵拉：这肯定需要很大的努力。好的，就在这里。演讲者4：[听不见]。

Eric Migicovsky: Yeah, things are much easier. So the question is like we're a bunch of software engineers, we have an idea that includes software and hardware, how do we get started on the hardware? Well the good news is that it's easier than ever.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：是的，事情要简单得多。所以问题是，我们是一群软件工程师，我们有一个想法，包括软件和硬件，我们如何开始硬件？好消息是这比以往任何时候都容易。

I wrote a blog post that was on Tech Crunch a couple of months ago about how software engineers could kind of get started on this and the recipe pretty simple. Find an off the shelf product that kind of does what you want to do.

几个月前，我在TechCrunch上写了一篇博文，讲述了软件工程师如何才能开始这方面的工作，并且这个方法非常简单。找一个现成的产品来做你想做的事。

Th at's kind of half way there that you can actually just buy off Amazon or Alibaba or something. Because the amount of time and money and tears that you'll save just buy buying a product that's half-way to what you want to build will do a couple of things. One is it will get you within two to three days or however long shipping takes an actual physical representation of what you think you want to build and you will began to use it hopeful to solve the problem that you want to solve and you will learn like maybe I'm completely wrong an this often happens. Like the best intention product when you actually build it might not actually solve the problem that you want to solve. So getting half-way there for $200 bucks or $300 bucks plus shipping is just so much better than weeks and months of prototyping just to get to the same kind of level.

在那里，你可以买下亚马逊或者阿里巴巴之类的东西。因为你要节省的时间、金钱和眼泪，只要买一件与你想要的东西半途而废的产品，就能做几件事。一是它能在两到三天内给你带来，或者不管你认为你想建造什么东西需要一个实际的物理表示法，你会开始使用它，希望解决你想要解决的问题，你会学到，好像我完全错了，这种情况经常发生。就像最好的产品，当你实际构建的时候，它可能并不能真正解决你想要解决的问题。因此，为了达到同样的水平，半途而废只需花费200美元或300美元，再加上装船费，要比几周甚至几个月的原型制作要好得多。

Th e next step after this is to take the 50% there product or the %75 percent there product and hack it to do what you think is better. Either adding a little bit of technology on to it, and adding your software stack, modifying it could be as simple as repurposing the same technology and changing the setup. A good example of this would be kind of the scooter companies.

在此之后的下一步是，将50%的产品或75%的产品黑客化，做你认为更好的事情。要么在上面添加一点技术，然后添加您的软件栈，修改它就像重新使用相同的技术和更改设置一样简单。这方面的一个很好的例子是一些滑板车公司。

Th ey took Show-Me Scooters, nine-bot scooters and they just glued on cell modems, that's it.

他拿了Show-me滑板车，9-bot滑板车，他们只是粘在手机调制解调器上，仅此而已。

Th at's how scooter sharing starts.

分享滑板车是怎么开始的。

I ts like cell modems and GPS plus scooter.

我喜欢手机调制解调器和GPS加滑板车。

Th ey didn't build this scooter themselves they just bought it off Alibaba and they bought the modems from some company that was making modems. So that's kind of the prototype I think for the next generation of consumer hardware as well as enterprise hardware.

这辆摩托不是自己制造的，他们只是从阿里巴巴买来的，他们还从一家生产调制解调器的公司购买了调制解调器。我认为这是下一代消费硬件的原型，也是企业硬件的原型。

We had a company two batches ago that builds cameras for neighborhoods, neighborhood security, and they used a raspberry pie in a Pie Cam and a three printed case and they sold those for hundreds of thousands of dollars and the hardware cost a very small amount of money and they're just solving a real problem for end-customers and people are paying them in exchange for that. So, yeah, it's even easier than ever. You can find people on Alibaba, you could meet factories over at WeChat, just don't try to build it all yourself. Don't hire an industrial design firm to build you some new design. Don't higher an engineer firm that promises to do a custom design for you because that will cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and it will probably be the wrong product versus like $300 bucks buying something, meeting the factory that makes that current product and asking them to kind of make the changes that you want to make.
Speaker 4: Before product market fit, do you recommend families to move closer to suppliers so places like Shenzhen, you know Beijing?

两批前，我们有一家公司，为社区和社区保安制造摄像头，他们用一个馅饼和三个印刷盒制作了一个覆盆子派，卖了几十万美元，而硬件只花了很少的钱，他们只是在为最终客户解决一个真正的问题-顾客和人们都在为此付出代价。所以，是的，这比以往任何时候都容易。你可以在阿里巴巴上找到人，你可以在微信上遇到工厂，只是不要自己去建造。不要雇佣一家工业设计公司为你设计一些新的设计。不要让一家工程师公司承诺为你做定制设计，因为这将花费数百或数千美元，这可能是错误的产品，而不是300美元购买某种东西，满足制造当前产品的工厂，并要求他们做一些你想做的改变。扬声器4：在产品市场适应之前，你是否建议家庭离供应商更近一些，比如深圳，你知道北京吗？

Eric Migicovsky: So the question is, should you move closer to Chen Gin or factories when you are pre-product market fit? If your pre-product market fit and you have a product that you're iterating on, figure out a way to reduce the iteration cycles so that you get more chances to dazzle customers and to find that product market fit. So you could solve that two way.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：那么问题是，如果你的产品市场合适，你是否应该向陈健或工厂靠拢？如果你的产品前市场适合，你有一个产品，你正在迭代，想出一个方法来减少迭代周期，使你有更多的机会，使客户眼花缭乱，并找到适合的产品市场。这样你就可以用两种方式解决这个问题。

I f you think that moving to the factories will enable you to do faster iteration than you already have sales channels setup, that's cool.

如果您认为迁移到工厂将使您能够进行比您已经建立销售渠道更快的迭代，这是很酷的。

I f not and you don't really have than many customers, then move closer to your customers so that they iteration can be done in software maybe, not hardware and your just spending every minute in front of your customers. So we have a couple of companies that did that in the last batch and they were using drones to solve very specific business process problems and they basically just moved to where those businesses are. Took up a crapy motel room and turned that motel room into a drone factory where they were making ad modifying their drone and that case was probably the right call for them.
Speaker 5: Do we have to protect our products or how can we protect?

如果没有，而且你真的没有很多客户，那么就离你的客户更近一些，这样他们就可以在软件上进行迭代，而不是在硬件上，你只是在你的客户面前花费每一分钟。因此，我们有几家公司在最后一批中这样做了，他们使用无人机来解决非常具体的业务流程问题，他们基本上只是转移到了这些企业所在的地方。开了一间汽车旅馆的房间，把汽车旅馆的房间变成了一家无人机工厂，他们在那里做广告修改他们的无人机，这个案子可能是他们的正确选择。演讲者5：我们必须保护我们的产品还是如何保护我们的产品？

Eric Migicovsky: Protection.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：保护。

I P protection. Trademark protection.

I P保护。商标保护。

I s that kind of what you're interest is? Yeah, Patents that kind of thing? So this question I think kind of touches on how do you build a motte for your company? How do you make sure that once you figure out a beautiful product, figure out who to sell it to, that some other dude doesn't come along and just steal your idea. So there's a couple of ways that you can solve this.

我就是你感兴趣的那种？是啊，专利之类的东西？因此，我认为这个问题涉及到你如何为你的公司建立一个小小的公司？你如何确保一旦你找到一个漂亮的产品，找出卖给谁，其他人不会来偷你的想法。所以有几种方法可以解决这个问题。

Th e best ways in my opinion are companies that have some sort of innate motte where it's either network affect, where the more people that use your product, the better is for everyone. Or some sort of data lock-in where you use the product, you generate data today but it happens to be in one ecosystem, someone who builds a competing piece of hardware can't get that data easily.

在我看来，最好的方法是那些有某种与生俱来的杂乱无章的公司，无论是网络影响还是网络影响，使用你产品的人越多，对每个人都越好。或者某种类型的数据锁定-在你使用该产品的地方，你今天会生成数据，但它恰好在一个生态系统中，构建一个相互竞争的硬件部件的人不可能轻易地获得这些数据。

Th ose are the two best like what do you think about that?

你觉得这是最好的两个吗？

Adora Cheung: I think those are good, I also think Patents previously used to be very hard to get.

张朵拉：我认为这些都很好，我也认为以前的专利是很难获得的。

We have a company called Cognition IP, I would just use them and you just pay them some little amount of money-

我们有一家叫认知IP的公司，我会用它们，而你只付他们一点钱-

Eric Migicovsky: They use software to help you file? So the problem with Patents is that they're not, like if you're thinking about this problem specifically like how do we block other people from copying our idea, there actually really difficult tools to use versus those other two things that I described that are actually, you control all of the levers.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：他们用软件帮你归档？专利的问题在于，如果你在思考这个问题，比如我们如何阻止其他人复制我们的想法，实际上，相对于我所描述的其他两件事，你控制了所有的杠杆，这是非常困难的工具。

I f you can build a product that has built-in network affect or built-in dates you control that. You don't have to rely on lawyers, you don't have to rely on the government, you don't have to rely on the courts, to enforce your domain dominance. But if you rely on Patents or that kind of thing you're basically saying, "I'm putting this money down as an investment but I'm gonna have to invest a lot more money later in order to use unlock that first investment. So it's very rare that start-ups build a successful motte using Patents.

如果您可以构建一个具有内置网络影响或内置日期您控制的产品。你不需要依赖律师，你不需要依赖政府，你不需要依靠法院，你就可以加强你的领域支配地位。但如果你依赖专利之类的东西，你基本上是在说，“我把这笔钱作为一种投资，但我以后要投入更多的钱，才能使用第一笔投资。所以，创业公司用专利建立一个成功的模型是非常罕见的。”

Th is happens much more in Bio Tech space.

这种情况在生物技术领域发生得更多。

Adora Cheung: Yes.

张朵拉：是的。

I agree with that.

我同意这一点。

I think building really great products is just really the only way to really build the motte.

我认为建造真正伟大的产品是真正建立小东西的唯一方法。

Eric Migicovsky: I mean, again, for 5% percent of companies there might be some sort of Patents strategy but for 95% it creates problems.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：我的意思是，对5%的公司来说，可能会有某种专利策略，但对95%的公司来说，这会带来问题。

Adora Cheung: Yeah.

张朵拉：是的。

I think it's also easy to build and people just copy it, even if you get the Patent so it really doesn't matter.

我认为它也很容易构建，人们只需复制它，即使你获得了专利，所以它真的不重要。

Eric Migicovsky: Well that's the thing, you need money to enforce the Patents. You need time to enforce it and if your companies dead, it's hard to enforce Patents.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：好吧，这就是问题所在，你需要钱来执行专利。你需要时间来执行它，如果你的公司死了，就很难执行专利。

Adora Cheung: Cool. Back there?
Speaker 6: If you're building a product just trying to solve a hard vetch problem like solving social media especially with AI, how do you convince people to go on and use this when your going after [inaudible] .

张朵拉：酷。后面？演讲者6：如果你正在开发一款产品，只是想解决一个棘手的问题，比如解决社交媒体问题，尤其是使用人工智能，那么你如何说服人们在你追求[听不到]的时候继续使用它。

Eric Migicovsky: Marginal markets are great. So the question was, what happens if I'm building a Hard Tech problem trying to solve a longer term problem? That first problem that I'm solving what if it looks too small? Honestly, the best investors will want to see a small market because a small market at the beginning means you can identify who's in that market very cheaply verses having to boil the oceans. Saying there's like 2% percent of all people in the world who are interested verses 80% of this one group. So it's cheaper and easier for you to find those customers.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：边缘市场是伟大的。所以问题是，如果我在努力解决一个长期的问题，那会发生什么呢？我要解决的第一个问题如果看上去太小怎么办？老实说，最好的投资者会希望看到一个小的市场，因为一个小的市场在开始意味着你可以识别谁在这个市场非常便宜的诗句必须沸腾海洋。说世界上约有2%的人对诗句感兴趣，其中80%的人对此感兴趣。所以更便宜更容易找到那些顾客。

Th e second thing is that small group of people will tell you quicker whether you have a good product or not because they know that they have a problem and your telling them, "Hey, buy this thing, it solves your problem." They can use it and be, "Yeah, that solves it.

第二件事是，一小群人会更快地告诉你是否有好的产品，因为他们知道他们有问题，你告诉他们，“嘿，买这个东西，它能解决你的问题。”他们可以用它，“是的，这解决了它。

Th at's good. Problem solved" They'll give you feedback. Whereas if your trying to again target like a really large group with a vague product idea, it's gonna be harder to know whether that person just wasn't interested that week, maybe they didn't have enough money.

这是好事。问题解决了“他们会给你反馈。然而，如果你试图像一个有着模糊的产品理念的大群体那样再次瞄准目标，那就很难知道那个人是否对这周不感兴趣，也许他们没有足够的钱。”

Th ere's more reasons than you had a bad product if it's a really vague and large market.

如果这个市场非常模糊和大的话，这比你有一个糟糕的产品有更多的原因。

Adora Cheung: Just to add on to that.

张朵拉：只是想补充一下。

I think starting small is good but also having a roadmap to how it builds into something big is good as well for investors specifically.

我认为从小到小是好的，但也有一个路线图，如何将它建设成一个大的东西，也是好的，特别是对投资者。

Eric Migicovsky: And for yourself as well to know like keep motivated.
Speaker 7: What do you think about the term of hardware for service because now [inaudible] .

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：对你自己来说，也要知道，要保持动力。演讲者7：你对硬件服务这个术语怎么看？因为现在(听不见)。

Eric Migicovsky: So this questions related to like do I pick a recurring business model, subscription business model, hardware service, or do I just sale the product? So this kind of goes back to what I was talking about before, which is making sure that you have the right, you're pretty sure your in the right business model track for your company. So there are a lot of these different tracks.

EricMigicovsky：那么这个问题与我是选择一个重复的商业模式，订阅业务模式，硬件服务，还是我只是销售产品有关的？所以，这种情况可以追溯到我之前所说的，即确保你有权利，你很肯定你在正确的商业模式轨道上为你的公司。所以有很多不同的轨道。

Th ey're not just hardware service, they're not just consumer, there's hybrid model, there's insurance models, there's advertising driven models, there's a ton of different way that you could look at it so it's not just one or the other. Heres what I would say, on the Enterprise side, you need to figure how much money you will save your customer, or how much more money they will make and price your product accordingly. Like your product price to them will be less than either how much they're saving or how much more they're making and you should try to price it as high as possible to still let them have some savings but you should rightfully so, earn some of the profit from that innovation that you have. Sometimes that may a hardware as a service model.

这不仅仅是硬件服务，他们不仅仅是消费者，还有混合模式，还有保险模式，还有广告驱动模式，你可以用很多不同的方式来看待它，所以它不仅仅是其中一种或另一种。以下是我想说的，在企业方面，你需要计算出你能为你的客户节省多少钱，或者他们会赚多少钱，并相应地给你的产品定价。就像你对他们来说，你的产品价格会低于他们储蓄的多少，或者他们赚的钱。你应该尽可能地给他们定价，让他们有一些储蓄，但你应该这样做，从你所拥有的创新中获得一些利润。有时，这可能是作为服务模型的硬件。

I t might be upfront and it really depends on kind of your customer at that point. So it's really hard for anyone to try to give advice on that front and it's much more around talking to customers, experimenting. You could do press experiments. Most companies are so small that every time a new person hears ...

这可能是预先的，这确实取决于您的客户在这一点上。因此，任何人都很难在这方面给出建议，而更多的是与客户交谈，进行实验。你可以做新闻实验。大多数公司都很小，每次新来的人听到.

I 'm sorry, every time they do PR new people who have never heard about it, will hear about it for the first time and they won't know what the last price was. So you can afford to do that kind of experimentation, especially at the beginning of your company.
Speaker 8: Is hiring.

我很抱歉，每次他们做公关时，从未听说过的新人会第一次听说这件事，而且他们不会知道最后的价格是多少。所以你有能力做这种实验，尤其是在你的公司刚开始的时候。发言人8：招聘。

An d having access to all problem [inaudible] .

能够接触到所有的问题[听不见]。

Eric Migicovsky: How do you do hiring, especially when you're scaling? Hiring is a mode that the company's in and it's a very distracting mode, so I think the mission of a early stage start-up is to get to product market fit.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：你是怎么招人的，尤其是在你工作的时候？招聘是公司的一种模式，也是一种非常分散注意力的模式，所以我认为早期创业的任务是去适应产品市场。

An d it's definitely not to hire a team. No one gets points for hiring a team or you get a very small number of points for hiring an amazing team. You get a lot more points for finding a product that has product market fit. So hiring in general is really a touchy subject, there's no one size fits all there. Some general advise that I have is what I mentioned before which is hire for trust and hire for reliability over hiring for specific domain knowledge.

绝对不是雇一个团队。没有人会因为雇用一个团队而得到分数，或者你会因为雇用一个令人惊叹的团队而得到很少的分数。找到一个适合产品市场的产品，你会得到更多的分数。因此，一般来说，招聘是一个敏感的话题，没有一个合适的标准。一些一般的建议，我已经是我前面提到的，是雇用的信任和雇用的可靠性，而不是雇用特定的领域知识。

Th is has really benefited me because right after we kind of hit on Kickstarter we were only two people of the company, two full-time people and two interns and so we had nobody and all of a sudden we needed to hire people and we could have spent three to six months hiring a 30% team, people that we would need to hire, experts that have done it before We could have spent time doing that.

这对我真的很有好处，因为在我们对Kickstart的了解之后，我们仅仅是公司的两个人，两个全职员工和两个实习生，所以我们没有人，我们突然需要雇佣一些人，我们可以花三到六个月的时间雇佣一个30%的团队，我们需要雇佣的人，那些在我们之前就做过的专家们本可以花时间去做这件事。

We would have delayed our initial production by probably three to six months, however long it would have taken to hire that team. So what I did instead was, I jut phoned up some of my best friends from university who had been intentionally involved in the project and said, "You need to quit your job and just fly here." And I think all of them, we just hired seven people within three or four days like that and that worked because we had that momentum and we had found product market fit and so they were like, "That's cool.

我们可能会把最初的生产延迟三到六个月，不管雇用这个团队需要多长时间。所以我所做的是，我没有打电话给我大学里一些有意参与这个项目的好朋友，说：“你得辞掉你的工作，飞到这里来。”我想他们都是，我们在三到四天内雇佣了7个人，因为我们有了这种动力，我们发现产品市场适合我们，所以他们说，“这很酷。

I wanna be part of this rocket ship.

我想成为火箭飞船的一员。

I wanna take off." But we didn't have to do three to six months of hiring, we did six to three days with the hiring and I knew them, I trusted them, they were instantly part of the team because it was just like we were working on another school project again.

我想离开。“但我们不需要做三到六个月的招聘，我们做了六到三天的招聘，我认识他们，我信任他们，他们立即成为了团队的一员，因为这就像我们又在做另一个学校项目一样。”

Adora Cheung: It seems like the best source pool is either people that you met in college or from working.

张朵拉：似乎最好的资源池要么是你在大学认识的人，要么是从工作中认识的人。

Eric Migicovsky: Past jobs you've had. Yeah, like to often people overlook like someone that they worked at a job with two or three years ago. One of the coolest hacks that you can do is just look through it manually, slowly. Look through your Facebook or LinkedIn and just look at every persons name and think, "Is this person cool and technical?" And just go through that list and you'll probably find a Co-Founder, you'll probably find a first employee, like some long lost friend from high school that's actually a super cool developer. You could hire her and just bring her on to the team.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：你以前做过的工作。是的，就像人们经常忽视两三年前在工作中工作的人一样。你能做的最酷的黑客之一就是手动、缓慢地浏览它。看看你的Facebook或LinkedIn，看看每个人的名字，就会想：“这个人是不是很酷，很专业吗？”只要翻阅这份清单，你可能会找到一位共同创始人，你可能会找到第一位员工，就像某个高中失散已久的朋友，实际上是个超级酷的开发人员。你可以雇她把她带到队里。

Adora Cheung: The second step that people miss then is actually asking that person and giving a real offer.

张朵拉：那时候人们错过的第二步实际上是问那个人，并给出一个真正的提议。

Th ere's always a, people do this ambiguous dance of like, "Oh, I don't want you to say no to me, so I'm not really gonna ask you."

一直以来，人们都在跳一种模棱两可的舞蹈，比如：“哦，我不想让你对我说不，所以我不会真的问你。”

Eric Migicovsky: So there's a good book called, "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" by Ben Horowitz and he talks a lot about working with friends and the difficulties and benefits of working with friends. So I'd read that book if you do end up hiring and working with a bunch of your friends.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：有一本好书，名为“艰难的事情”，作者是本·霍洛维茨，他讲了很多关于和朋友一起工作的问题，以及和朋友一起工作的困难和好处。所以我会读那本书，如果你以雇佣和与一群朋友一起工作而结束的话。

Adora Cheung: Right back there?
Speaker 9: On one hand your like well this might be solved with a little bit of power but it would also [inaudible] .

张：就在后面？扩音器9：一方面，你喜欢的，这也许可以用一点力量解决，但它也会[听不见]。

Eric Migicovsky: Question was, For some project problems, they can be solved exclusively by software, how do you know when to involve hardware in it? When in doubt take all the hardware out, doesn't solve the problem.

EricMigicovsky：问题是，对于一些项目问题，他们可以完全通过软件解决，你怎么知道什么时候涉及硬件？当有疑问的时候，把所有的硬件都拿出来，并不能解决问题。

Th at's the best place to start.

这是最好的起点。

Th at's why I was kind of saying like how could you just buy something off the shelf and just use it. Because you may need some hardware, you may need a camera, you may need a microphone, you may need a commute platform, just buy raspberry pie and plug USB devices into it. You don't need to build anything these days. Some people that that it's not gonna be in the right form factor, or it's not going to do the exact right thing as what I think our customers need. Just try. Just build something, hack something together, and see if it at least almost solves the problem because like I was saying more often than not that initial test will prove that either you have really good problem that really needs to be solved or nobody really has that problem and you don't need to now spend three months working on custom hardware.
Speaker 10: So actually we are creating a holographic [inaudible] what is the best way to [inaudible] .

这就是为什么我会说，你怎么能买到现成的东西，然后就用它。因为你可能需要一些硬件，你可能需要一个摄像头，你可能需要一个麦克风，你可能需要一个通勤平台，只需购买覆盆子派和插入USB设备。这些天你不需要建造任何东西。有些人认为这是不正确的形式因素，或者它不会做完全正确的事情，因为我认为我们的客户需要。试试看。只需构建一些东西，一起破解一些东西，看看它是否至少解决了这个问题，因为正如我经常说的那样，最初的测试将证明，要么你有非常好的问题需要解决，要么没有人真的有这个问题，而且你现在不需要花三个月的时间在定制硬件上工作。演讲者10：实际上，我们正在创造一个全息的[听不见的]什么是最好的方法[听不见]。

Eric Migicovsky: So the question was, we have a really complex product an AI Psychotherapist or therapist that can help people. How do we demo that or how do we convey that product to people? I would hazer to guess that it's kind of a similar question to the last one, it's like are there ways that we can do this in software rather than hardware. So if I were working on a project like that I might start by actually creating the assistant as an app first or maybe like a 3-D unity character that approximates it that gets similar, close to what you want to do or use an off the shelf device like a HoloLens or Magic Leaf, or something like that, where even though it will cost way more than you think it's gonna cost for the future, this is kind of the trick. Like over spend in the early days. Spend more than you have in order to get that first test done if it's possible.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：所以问题是，我们有一个非常复杂的产品-人工智能心理治疗师或治疗师，可以帮助人们。我们如何演示该产品或如何将该产品传递给人们？我会猜测这是一个类似于最后一个问题的问题，就像我们是否有办法在软件而不是硬件上做到这一点。所以，如果我在做这样的项目，我可能会首先把助手作为应用程序来创建，或者像一个类似于它的三维统一角色，接近你想要做的事情，或者使用一个现成的设备，比如全息镜头或魔法叶，或者类似的东西，即使它的成本比你想象的要高得多，但这是一种诡计。就像早年过度消费一样。如果可能的话，花更多的钱来完成第一次测试。

I f you don't have any money then I guess you can't, but if you have a little bit of money, spend that $400 dollars to get a Oculus so that you can simulate the experience in VR before you actually go make the hardware.
Speaker 11: The thing about building a company is you have to have a product market fit from your own revenues and profits and potentially [inaudible] .

如果你没有钱，那么我想你做不到，但如果你有一点钱，花400美元买一个Oculus，这样你就可以在虚拟现实中模拟体验，然后才能真正制造硬件。演讲者11：建立一家公司的关键是，你必须拥有一个适合你自己的收入和利润的产品市场，并且有可能(听不见)。

Eric Migicovsky: I would actually go one step above that and understand why hardware companies need financing? Usually it's for inventory.

埃里克·米基科夫斯基：我真的会比这高出一步，明白为什么硬件公司需要融资？通常是为了库存。

I t's rare that a company will have to get funding for, I guess it's not rare, there's like funding for inventory and there's funding for R&D. Funding for R&D is like you need that. You can either get it through prepayments from potential customers that's harder but most people try to raise R&D funding from people like YC or other investors. Banks will not lend you money for R&D, your family might. So I would try to reduce that as much as possible. Try to spend as little money as possible hacking together, prototyping, getting to the point where you know what products you're gonna build.

一家公司很难获得资金，我想这并不罕见，就像库存资金和研发资金一样，研发资金就像你需要的那样。你可以通过潜在客户的预付来获得这一点，这很难，但大多数人都试图从YC或其他投资者那里筹集研发资金。银行不会借钱给你进行研发，你的家人可能会借钱给你。所以我会尽量减少。试着尽可能少地花金钱在一起，制作原型，达到你知道你要生产什么产品的地步。

Th en on the inventory financing side, heres the thing that I've learned.

在库存融资方面，这是我学到的东西。

I nventory sucks.

我不好受。

I nventory's' is one of the hardest things that hardware companies have to deal with because they can't make money generally until they have a rodent that they need to sale.

I nventory‘是硬件公司必须处理的最困难的事情之一，因为它们一般在有一只需要出售的啮齿动物之前是无法赚钱的。

I t costs money to build that product and it costs time to build that product. So you have what's called a cash conversion cycle where you may need to put inputs, dollars, into your product in order to get outputs down the road. Again, it is impossible, it is very difficult to manage inventory. So the better thing is to actually to rise above it and to get into a situation where you don't need to buy as much inventory.

建造那个产品需要钱，而制造那个产品也需要时间。因此，你有一个所谓的现金转换周期，你可能需要把投入，美元，你的产品，以获得输出的道路上。再一次，这是不可能的，很难管理库存。因此，更好的办法是实际上超越它，进入一个你不需要购买那么多库存的情况。

Th ere's two ways that you can do this. One is you can get customers to pre order, that's the easiest way because then you have a very perfect idea of how many units you need to build so that you can, and you can use that money from pre orders to actually fund the development, you don't need to raise money from [inaudible] , you don't need to raise money for [inaudible] .

这是两种你可以做到的方法。一个是你可以让客户预定，这是最简单的方法，因为你有一个非常完美的概念，你需要建造多少个单元，这样你就可以用预购的钱来资助开发，你不需要从(听不到的)那里筹到钱，你不需要为[听不到]而筹集资金。

Th at doesn't work always, but it does work in some crazy situations like Show-Me, up until two or three years ago sold their phones on Tuesday mornings. You couldn't go onto the website and buy Showme phones , you could only buy them Tuesday mornings. So it was like a thing, everyone would be at their computers on Tuesday mornings waiting for the latest drop of Showme phones and they had a really short production cycle, like not a week, but they knew based on these Tuesday sales, how many units that they'd need to make over the next couple of weeks. One Plus also did the same thing. So that's one way of doing it, the pre order route.

它并不总是起作用，但在一些疯狂的情况下，比如Show-me，直到两三年前的周二早上，它才开始销售手机。你不能在网站上买Showme手机，只能在周二早上购买。所以这就像一件事，每个人都会在周二早上的电脑前等待最新的Showme手机的下降，他们的生产周期很短，比如不是一周，但是他们知道根据周二的销量，他们需要在接下来的几周里生产多少部手机。One Plus也做了同样的事情。所以这是一种方法，预定路线。

Th e other way is to change your product so that it takes a short time amount of time to build.

另一种方法是改变你的产品，使它需要很短的时间来构建。

Th is is called reducing the lead times. So the secret benefit of reducing your lead times is that you have to put less of your hard earned cash into inventory that will then take months to turn into actual revenue. So interestingly enough sometimes it's in your best interest to pay more for the product, pay more for the building materials, pay more for the components if the lead times are shorter because you may not actually have a margin problem, like you actually have quite a bit of free margin but you have this cash flow problem where you can't fund new batches of products because it takes six months to turn that product into revenue. So you could take some of the margin, you could do a trade off where you earn less profit per unit, but you're taking less of a risk upfront.

这叫做缩短周转时间。因此，减少周转时间的秘密好处是，你必须将你辛苦挣来的现金中较少的投入到库存中，然后花上几个月的时间才能转化为实际收入。因此，有趣的是，有时你最感兴趣的是，为产品支付更多的钱，为建筑材料支付更多的费用，如果交货时间较短，则支付更多的费用，因为你可能实际上没有利润问题，就像你实际上有相当多的自由利润，但你有一个现金流问题，你不能资助新的产品批次，因为它需要六个月的时间将该产品转化为收入。因此，你可以拿一些保证金，你可以做一个折中，你的单位利润较少，但你是承担较少的风险前期。

Th at's kind of the general learnings that I've had around how to do hardware financing.

这是我在硬件融资方面学到的一些东西。
