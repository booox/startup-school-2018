# Michael Seibel - Building Product

#Michael Seibel-建筑产品

Geoff Ralston: Without any further delay, I will introduce to you Michael Seibel, the CEO of Y  Combinator, the founder of companies, like Justin.tv, and Twitch, and Socialcam.

Geoff Ralston: 我将向你们介绍Y Combinator的首席执行官迈克尔·塞贝尔(Michael Seibel)，他是Justin.tv、Twitc和SocialCAM等公司的创始人。

To begin what is  going to be a deep dive into product over the next several lectures, Michael.
Michael Seibel: Before I begin, kind of had a conversation with Jeff, and I wanted to say  a couple things about my experience at Justin.tv and Twitch. What I will say is  that we broke many, if not all, of the rules that I'm about to tell  you at various points during our company.

迈可，在接下来的几个讲座中，开始深入研究产品。迈克尔·塞贝尔：在我开始之前，我和杰夫谈了一谈，我想说几句关于我在Justin.tv和Twitc的经历。我要说的是，我们违反了很多，如果不是全部的话，我要告诉你的规则，在我们公司的不同时刻。

The things that allowed us to survive were  one, our founding team was extremely technical. Justin, Emmett, and Kyle all were amazing to  work with.

让我们生存下来的是一件事，我们的创始团队是极具技术性的。贾斯汀，埃米特和凯尔都很棒。

And basically, what I found amazing about them is they were not intimidated  by any technical challenge.

基本上，我发现他们的惊人之处在于他们没有被任何技术挑战所吓倒。

I think that I would not be standing here if I  wasn't privileged to work with them.

我想如果我没有特权和他们一起工作，我就不会站在这里了。

And so I think this is something that a  lot of companies, a lot of startups, a lot of startup founders, don't truly understand,  but that fact allowed us to break a lot of rules.

所以我认为这是很多公司，很多创业公司的创始人并不真正理解的事情，但是这个事实让我们打破了很多规则。

The second is we  didn't spend a lot of money. We moved out when we were 21, 22, 22,  and 23. We lived in a two bedroom apartment.

第二，我们没有花很多钱。我们在21岁、22岁、22岁和23岁时搬出去了。我们住在一间两居室的公寓里。

That apartment cost $2,500 a month.  We were each given $500 a month walking around money, which technically is against the  law, because it was below minimum wage, but who cares about laws? And that was  it.

那套公寓每月要价2500美元。我们每人每月都有500美元的钱，这在技术上是违法的，因为它低于最低工资，但谁在乎法律呢？就这样了。

That was the game. Emmett got his own bedroom. Kyle and Justin slept in  bunk beds.

这就是游戏。埃米特有自己的卧室。凯尔和贾斯汀睡在双层床上。

I slept in the living room, and sometimes on the balcony. We just  didn't spend much money. But that gave us a lot of ability to screw up  and mistakes.

https://tmt.ap-hongkong.tencentcloudapi.com/?Action=TextTranslate&Nonce=1234&ProjectId=1257710951&Region=ap-hongkong&SecretId=AKIDt9Vo18v2oQs9FAgUVMrOtEUccSIyqp3K&Source=en&SourceText=I+slept+in+the+living+room%2C+and+sometimes+on+the+balcony.+We+just++didn%27t+spend+much+money.+But+that+gave+us+a+lot+of+ability+to+screw+up++and+mistakes.&Target=zh&Timestamp=1549349400&Version=2018-03-21&Signature=TZtb2pgxa1lT5gTInYmHoH84S%2BU=

And I'd say the last thing that was kind of interesting and I  only realized later is that our ego was highly tied to our startup. We were  not doing a startup to have a cool resume item.

我想说的是，最后一件有趣的事情是，我后来才意识到，我们的自我意识与我们的创业紧密相连。我们做创业不是为了有一个很酷的简历项目。

It was really the only  thing we had done on our own.

这确实是我们自己做的唯一件事。

And so I think at various points during  the company, when it looked like we would fail, basically our startup failing was our  life failing. Right? It was like, well this is the only we've done so far,  and so if it fails, you get F on life.

所以我认为，在公司的各个阶段，当我们看起来会失败的时候，基本上我们的创业失败就是我们的人生失败。对吗？就像，这是我们迄今为止唯一做过的，如果失败了，你就会得到F。

And I think that we  all had that feeling very internally, and therefore, we just couldn't really conceive of giving  up.

我认为我们都有这种内在的感觉，因此，我们无法真正设想放弃。

I think, more than anything I'm going to say in the rest of this  presentation, those were the three things that saved our company, made our company work, and  strangely, I don't even think ...

我想，在接下来的演讲中，我要说的最重要的是，这三件事拯救了我们的公司，使我们的公司运转起来，而且奇怪的是，我甚至不认为.

If you take one of those things away, any  one of them, we would have died.

如果你拿走其中的一件，任何一件，我们都会死的。

This isn't one of those things where it's  like, "Oh, you can grab for one or two and that's pretty good." We needed  all three or else, game over.

这并不是说，“哦，你可以拿一两个，这很不错。”我们需要所有三个，否则，游戏结束。

As I get into product, I'm going to tell  stories from Justin.tv, from really early days of Twitch when I was still there, and  then also from a YC from a couple batches ago names Poppy.

当我进入产品领域的时候，我将从Justin.tv上讲述故事，从我还在那里的Twitc的早期开始，然后从几个批次前名字Poppy的YC上讲故事。

It's a company  that I've advised since and have invested in.

这是一家我从此以后就建议并投资的公司。

It's a YC, great founder named Avni.  And weirdly I just feel like I needed to do a case study outside of  my own story. Somehow it's going to help share these lessons a little better.

这是一个YC，伟大的创始人，名叫Avni。奇怪的是，我觉得我需要在我自己的故事之外做一个案例研究。不知何故，这将有助于更好地分享这些教训。

I  always like to start with what problem are you solving, because when I am pitched  by founders, most often they just want to tell me what their idea is, what  they're going to do, what their product does.

我总是喜欢从你要解决的问题开始，因为当我被创始人推介时，他们通常只是想告诉我他们的想法是什么，他们要做什么，他们的产品是做什么的。

And I think what's interesting is that  oftentimes they don't even know why.

我认为有趣的是，他们常常甚至不知道为什么。

They don't know what's the problem that they expect  to be solved at the end of what they are doing. Now I think that  for some businesses, it's totally fine, right? I think that especially if you're early on,  especially if things are still in project phase, whatever. But I think at some point  pretty early on you have to figure out what are we doing, and what do  we expect the result to be? At Justin.tv, the first thing, the problem we were  solving was entertainment. We were making TV shows. Justin was the first one to broadcast  his life 24-7.

他们不知道在他们所做的事情结束后，他们期望解决的问题是什么。现在我认为对一些企业来说，这是完全没有问题的，对吧？我认为，特别是如果你还早，特别是当事情仍然处于项目阶段，任何事情。但我认为，在相当早期的某个时候，你必须弄清楚我们在做什么，以及我们期望的结果是什么？在Justin.tv，我们要解决的第一件事就是娱乐。我们在制作电视节目。贾斯汀是第一个24小时7小时播出自己生活的人。

It was supposed to be a TV show.

本来应该是个电视节目的。

It was actually pretty  easy for us to understand whether that was working or not.

事实上，我们很容易理解这是否奏效。

Is anyone watching, right?  That's the problem we were solving. People watch TV shows. No one was watching, so  we didn't solve the problem.

有人在看吗？这就是我们要解决的问题。人们看电视节目。没有人在看，所以我们没有解决问题。

Then when we pivoted to an open platform, the problem  became can we let anyone broadcast live? That was the problem we were trying to  solve.

然后，当我们转向一个开放的平台时，问题就变成了我们能让任何人现场直播吗？这就是我们想要解决的问题。

Anyone can broadcast live on the internet.

任何人都可以在网上直播。

And once again, once we understood that,  it was very easy for us to judge whether or not someone could do it.  We had this open platform, is anyone using it? But I think though that was  key to what we were doing.

再一次，一旦我们明白了这一点，我们就很容易判断是否有人能做到这一点。我们有这个开放的平台，有人用过吗？但我认为这是我们所做工作的关键。

And then sometimes when I talk to founders, there  is something that they want to do in the world, there's a problem that they're  vaguely interested in, or there's an idea they're vaguely in, but they really haven't nailed  down what the actual problem we're solving? If you don't know the problem, you can't  know whether you've solved it.

有时候，当我和创始人交谈时，他们想在这个世界上做些什么，他们对一个问题有着模糊的兴趣，或者他们有个想法，但他们真的没有弄清楚我们要解决的实际问题是什么？如果你不知道这个问题，你就不知道你是否解决了它。

The first thing I ask founders, "Can you speak the  problem clearly in two sentences?" If you can't, you don't know the problem, right? In  fact, it should really only take you one sentence.

我第一件事是问创始人，“你能用两句话把问题说清楚吗？”如果你做不到，你就不知道问题出在哪里，对吧？事实上，它应该只需要你一句话。

If someone asks you what problem  you're solving, and you find yourself delivering an essay, you're doing it wrong.

如果有人问你要解决什么问题，而你发现自己写了一篇文章，那就是你做错了。

Two: Have  you experienced the problem yourself? This is not always required, but is certainly helpful.

第二：你自己也经历过这个问题吗？这并不总是必需的，但肯定是有帮助的。

I've  met a lot of founders who are trying to solve a problem for someone else,  who they've never met, never talked to, and don't truly know whether that person exists  in the world.

我见过很多创始人，他们试图为别人解决一个问题，他们从未见过，也从未与他们交谈过，也不知道这个人是否存在于这个世界上。

And so all things being equal, this is a great hint that  you're onto something. Well, at least one person has had this problem before.

所以，在所有条件相同的情况下，这是一个很好的提示，表明你在做一些事情。至少有一个人以前有过这个问题。

The next  one's can you define this problem narrowly? What's interesting is when you get started, you  can't really solve this problem for everyone who has it. When Justin.tv first started, we  couldn't let anyone broadcast live video, you had to have a laptop, you had to  have good internet connection, you had to have a webcam.

下一个问题你能狭义地定义这个问题吗？有趣的是，当你开始的时候，你不可能真正解决这个问题的每一个有它的人。当Justin.tv刚开始的时候，我们不能让任何人播放现场视频，你必须有一台笔记本电脑，你必须有良好的互联网连接，你必须有一个网络摄像头。

There were all these kind  of things you needed.

你需要这么多东西。

And so could we actually now talk about, all right, we  want to make live video for everyone. But let's talk about the people that we  can address first. Who can we help first? And I think oftentimes founders want to  skip that step, and they want to solve the mega problem, like, "I want to  cure cancer.

那么我们现在能不能讨论一下，好吧，我们想为每个人制作现场视频。但让我们先谈谈我们能联系到的人。我们能先帮谁？我常常认为创始人想跳过这一步，他们想解决这个巨大的问题，比如，“我想要治愈癌症。”

I'm only talking about when everyone's cured." As opposed to like, "What can  we address immediately? How do we get the first indication that this thing is working?"  And then the last one, is the problem solvable? Here's what I'll bring up with  Poppy. Poppy's a company that's essentially Uber for babysitting.

https://tmt.ap-hongkong.tencentcloudapi.com/?Action=TextTranslate&Nonce=1234&ProjectId=1257710951&Region=ap-hongkong&SecretId=AKIDt9Vo18v2oQs9FAgUVMrOtEUccSIyqp3K&Source=en&SourceText=I%27m+only+talking+about+when+everyone%27s+cured.%22+As+opposed+to+like%2C+%22What+can++we+address+immediately%3F+How+do+we+get+the+first+indication+that+this+thing+is+working%3F%22++And+then+the+last+one%2C+is+the+problem+solvable%3F+Here%27s+what+I%27ll+bring+up+with++Poppy.+Poppy%27s+a+company+that%27s+essentially+Uber+for+babysitting.&Target=zh&Timestamp=1549349408&Version=2018-03-21&Signature=YmUqnMjeLYS/CthmJ6UMWTaDc6g=

They make it really easy for  babysitters, I'm sorry, for parents who need babysitters, to get babysitters. Poppy's a very interesting  company, because you need babysitters for a lot of different types of things. Some people  need a babysitter five days weeks, while the parent's at work, right? That looks a  little bit more like a nanny. Some people need a babysitter when it's an emergency.  "Oh, I have a medical emergency and I need a babysitter right now, because I  need to go to a hospital." Some people need it because there was misplanning, "Oh,  I thought my husband was going to be here at this time, and he wasn't."  "I thought I was going to be here and wasn't.

很抱歉，对于那些需要保姆的父母来说，他们很容易找到保姆。波比是一家非常有趣的公司，因为你需要保姆来做很多不同类型的事情。有些人在父母上班的时候需要五天的保姆，对吧？看起来有点像保姆。有些人在紧急情况下需要一个保姆。“哦，我有急症，现在需要一个保姆，因为我需要去医院。”有些人需要它，因为有错误的计划，“哦，我以为我丈夫这个时候会在这里，而他没有。”“我以为我会在这里，而不是。

I need a babysitter." Some  people need a babysitter because they have an infant, right? And so this babysitter needs  to have a bunch of skills. Some people need a babysitter to watch their 15  year old and make sure they don't get out of the house. Different skills.

我需要一个保姆。“有些人需要一个保姆，因为他们有一个婴儿，对吗？所以这个保姆需要一些技能。有些人需要一个保姆来照看他们15岁的孩子，并确保他们不会走出家门。不同的技能。

And  so what's interesting is that if you just start with oh, we're going to help  people get babysitters, it's not really good enough to understand what you can address right  away. Right? Which one of those use cases do you want to address? If you  were to state the problem more narrowly though, let's say we wanted to start out  with infants, right? We want to make it easy for parents to get babysitters for  infants.

所以有趣的是，如果你只是从哦，我们要帮助人们找到保姆，这还不足以理解你可以马上解决的问题。对吗？这些用例中的哪一个是您想要处理的？如果你要把这个问题描述得更狭窄一些，比方说我们想从婴儿开始，对吗？我们想让父母更容易地为婴儿找保姆。

Then we can really ask the question, is the problem solvable? And I think  one of the things that Poppy discovered when offering their business is that the level  of skill that you need for a parent to trust you with their infant, when  they haven't met you, is very, very high.

那么我们真的可以问这个问题，这个问题是可以解决的吗？我认为波比在提供他们的生意时发现的一件事是，当他们还没见过你的时候，父母相信你和他们的孩子在一起所需要的技能水平是非常高的。

And so the idea that you're going  to have a rotating set of people you haven't met watch your little baby, hard,  very, very hard.

所以你会有一组你还没见过的人看着你的小宝宝，非常努力。

They have to be very skilled.

他们必须非常熟练。

And then on the flip side,  the Uber model only works because there's a whole bunch of basically replaceable people with  a common skill. Well, it turns out the people who've got the skills to watch  infants and make parents comfortable with that, tend to have nanny jobs where they work  lots of hours, and tend to be paid fairly well, especially in up and coming  cities.

另一方面，优步模式只起作用，因为有一大群基本可以替代的人，他们都有共同的技能。事实证明，那些有能力观察婴儿并让父母感到舒服的人倾向于在他们工作很长时间的情况下做保姆工作，而且薪水也很高，尤其是在城市里和即将到来的城市。

And so now we have this disconnect where it's like, well, we want to  solve the problem of infant watching for moms, but that talent pool who can solve  the problem, the supply of babysitters, they might not exist. Problem might not be solvable.  And so going through this exercise, in real time, with your products out in the  world, you should be thinking about these things. You should be thinking, how am I  narrowly defining the problem I want to solve first? And you should be always asking  yourself, is it actually solvable? I think a lot of founders just don't want to  think about this, because it's hard.

所以现在我们有了这样的脱节，就像，我们想要解决妈妈们照看婴儿的问题，但是那些能解决这个问题的人才库，保姆的供应，他们可能不存在。问题可能无法解决。因此，通过这个练习，实时的，随着你的产品在世界上推出，你应该考虑这些事情。你应该想，我是如何狭义地定义我想首先解决的问题？你应该一直问自己，这真的是可以解决的吗？我认为很多创始人只是不想去想这件事，因为这很难。

It's hard to think about who you want to  talk to first.

很难想象你想先和谁说话。

It's hard to understand, oh, maybe I can't solve their problem.

很难理解，哦，也许我解决不了他们的问题。

I  have to move on.

我必须向前看。

Avni as a mother of two kids.

作为两个孩子的母亲。

And she was really  pissed she couldn't solve this problem, because it was her problem. But, it's turned out  to be a very, very hard problem to solve. Young infants, on demand babysitters.

她真的很生气，她不能解决这个问题，因为这是她的问题。但是，事实证明，这是一个非常难解决的问题。婴儿，按需提供保姆。

All  right, the next question I always ask is, who is your customer? And really you  don't understand the problem you're solving until you understand who you're solving it for.

好吧，我一直问的下一个问题是，你的客户是谁？而真正的你不理解你正在解决的问题，直到你明白你要为谁解决它。

A  lot of times people just want to say everyone. Everyone's a customer, right? And that  seems like it makes sense, in some cases, right? If you're building a social network  or a search engine, right? Everyone uses those things now. What I will say is  that in almost all of the products that everyone uses now, there was a time  when almost no one used them.

很多时候人们只想说每个人。每个人都是顾客对吧？在某些情况下，这似乎是有道理的，对吧？如果你在建立一个社交网络或者搜索引擎，对吧？现在每个人都用那些东西。我要说的是，在几乎所有现在每个人都使用的产品中，有一段时间几乎没有人使用它们。

And the creators of those products had to figure  out, who was the ideal first customer? And so if you don't have a good  answer to this question, you're going to be lost. You have no idea who you  should talk to, to ask them whether this problem has been solved, you have no  idea who to talk to, to figure out who this product is for.

而这些产品的创建者必须弄清楚，谁是最理想的第一位客户？所以如果你对这个问题没有一个很好的答案，你就会迷失方向。你不知道你应该和谁交谈，问他们这个问题是否已经解决，你不知道该和谁交谈，也不知道这个产品是给谁的。

And you'd  be surprised the number of founders who are just building something as if they were  writing a creative novel, where it's just a product of their own brain, and no  interaction with anyone on the outside, and it's not even a problem that they're solve  ...

你会感到惊讶的是，有这么多的创始人只是在创作一本有创意的小说，这只是他们自己大脑的产物，没有与外界任何人的互动，他们甚至没有解决任何问题。

That they experience themselves. Don't do that. Don't be one of those founders. You  can talk to your users. You just have to figure out who they are.

他们经历了自己。别干那事别成为那些创始人之一。你可以和你的用户谈谈。你只需要弄清楚他们是谁。

The  next question I often ask is how often does your user have the problem? What's  so surprising is when you talk through startups with people, sometimes they choose problems without  quite understanding who the user is, or the frequency of the problem.

我经常问的下一个问题是，您的用户多久会遇到这个问题？令人惊讶的是，当你通过创业公司与人交谈时，他们有时会选择问题，而不完全了解用户是谁，也不知道问题的频率。

I'll give you  an example.

我给你举个例子。

A lot of people will come to YC, and a popular idea back  in the day was to build a car shopping website. Now if you guys have  been on a car shopping websites, especially about five ago, they all basically suck.

很多人会来YC，当时流行的想法是建立一个汽车购物网站。现在，如果你们在一个汽车购物网站上，特别是在五年前，他们基本上都很糟糕。

They're  hard to use.

很难用。

They're not very transparent. You kind of want to have this almost  Tesla experience of just buying a car, but they never actually work out that way.  And what's interesting is that a lot of founders come back to this problem over  and over and over again.

它们不太透明。你有点想要这样的特斯拉经验，只是买一辆车，但他们从来没有这样做。有趣的是，很多创始人一次又一次地回到这个问题上。

And they always think that their customer is the person  buying a car. Now, the reality is, is that when you go buy a car,  assuming it's not a complete lemon, you typically keep that car for seven years. What  happens if I told you I'm going to create a startup and if I home  run with my customer, if my fucking customer loves me, they're going to come back  seven years from now.

他们总是认为他们的顾客是买车的人。现在，现实是，当你去买一辆车，假设它不是一个完全的柠檬，你通常保留这辆车七年。如果我告诉你我要创建一家创业公司，如果我和我的客户一起在家跑步，如果我的客户爱我，那么七年后他们就会回来。

That's hard.

这很难。

It's very hard.

这很难。

It turns out a lot of  the car buying website are not built for the person who's shopping for a car,  because that person doesn't have a problem very often.

事实证明，很多购车网站都不是为买车的人而建的，因为这个人通常不会有问题。

They're actually built for the person  who's selling a car.

它们实际上是为卖车的人设计的。

That person has a problem every day. Every day the dealership  has to hit their numbers.

那个人每天都有问题。经销商每天都要打他们的号码。

And so you don't see, as a customer, how that  product helps the real customer, the person who's trying to sell cars.

所以你没有看到，作为一个客户，这种产品是如何帮助真正的客户，试图销售汽车的人。

And so by  doing this analysis, I really try to push founders in understanding who is getting the  most value out of this product? And it's really helpful if you're trying to help  someone with a problem they have frequently.

因此，通过做这个分析，我真的试图促使创始人了解谁从这个产品中获得最大的价值？如果你想帮助那些经常遇到问题的人，那是很有帮助的。

If you think about the products that you  use on a daily basis, they tend to be on the front screen of your  phone. You tend to use them without even thinking.

如果你想一想你每天使用的产品，它们就会出现在你手机的前屏幕上。你甚至不用思考就会使用它们。

They become almost extensions of you.  If you think about apps that you've installed and then they're kind of on the  third page in the back, or they're buried on the second page of some folder,  those tend to be the ones you don't use very often. Hopefully they don't need  you to use them very often, or else they're probably not very good businesses.

它们几乎成了你的延伸。如果你想到你已经安装的应用程序，然后它们在后面的第三页，或者它们被埋在某个文件夹的第二页，这些程序往往是你不经常使用的。希望他们不需要你经常使用，否则他们可能不是很好的生意。

The  next question I always ask is, how intense is the problem? I find a lot  of founders think they have a good idea, but they don't do this frequency and  intensity analysis.

我经常问的下一个问题是，问题有多严重？我发现很多创始人认为他们有一个好主意，但他们不做这种频率和强度分析。

And so if you have both an infrequent and low intensity problem that  you're trying to solve, you're going to have a problem getting a lot of customers  even interested in talking to you.

因此，如果你有一个不常见的和低强度的问题，你试图解决，你会遇到一个问题，让许多客户甚至有兴趣与你交谈。

All things being equal, if you graph problems, it's  nicer for them to be higher intensity, higher frequency. Let's think about a company, like  Uber, for example. Usually when you are somewhere and you need to go somewhere else,  it's a pretty intense problem. "I have to go to work." "I have to go  to the doctor." "I have to go pick up my kids." They're so intense you  might have bought a $20,000 car to help you do those things, right? It's an  intense problem.

在所有条件相同的情况下，如果你绘制问题，它们的强度越高，频率越高。让我们想想像优步这样的公司。通常，当你在某个地方，你需要去其他地方，这是一个相当严重的问题。“我得去上班了。”“我得去看医生。”“我得去接我的孩子”他们太紧张了，你可能买了一辆两万美元的车来帮你做这些事，对吧？这是个严重的问题。

And then when you think about frequency, how often do you move more  than a mile, more than walking distance every day? Happens a lot.

然后当你想到频率时，你每天移动超过一英里，超过步行距离的频率是多少？经常发生。

And so if  you think about that, even though you look at the taxi market and you say,  "Oh, taxis are before Uber." Taxis, that's not that big of a market.

因此，如果你想一想，即使你看看出租车市场，你会说，“哦，出租车在优步之前。”出租车，那不是那么大的市场。

If you  just look at the customer, you say, "High intensity problem that happens very often.

如果你只看客户，你就会说：“高强度的问题经常发生。

There's  probably a good business here." The last one is are they willing to pay? So  many founders who come into YC, their first thought is completely wrong on this front.  Their first thought is, I need to give it away for free, because that's the  only way I'm going to get users. One of the things that I always push  them to do is think about is this way.

这里可能有很好的生意。“最后一个是他们愿意付钱吗？太多的创始人来到YC，他们的第一个想法在这方面是完全错误的。他们的第一个想法是，我需要免费提供它，因为这是我获得用户的唯一途径。我一直催促他们做的事情之一就是这样想。

If you want to know whether  you have a good product, it's a lot easier to make it a little bit  harder for your users to use up.

如果你想知道你是否有一个好的产品，那么让你的用户更难使用它就容易多了。

And then see if they use it anyways.  Because if I have an extremely intense problem and you say, "Well, it's going to  cost $100," for the person with an extremely intense problem, they're going to think that's  a deal.

然后看看他们有没有用过它。因为如果我有一个非常严重的问题，你会说，“嗯，它将花费100美元，”对于一个非常严重的问题的人，他们会认为这是一个交易。

If you don't have an extremely intense problem, you charge zero dollars. You  need a bunch of users who come in, who don't really have the problem, but  they're just trying something out.

如果你没有一个非常严重的问题，你收取零美元。你需要一群进来的用户，他们其实没有问题，但他们只是在尝试一些东西。

If you try to learn from them on how to  improve your product, oftentimes they'll lead you astray. So strangely, starting with a higher price  or a price is almost always better than starting free.

如果你试图向他们学习如何改进你的产品，他们往往会让你误入歧途。所以奇怪的是，从更高的价格或价格开始几乎总是比免费的好。

Almost always better.

几乎总是更好。

And if  you have to start free, you need to do this analysis of how do you  talk with users where the problem is actually intense? How do you talk to the  users who are using your product frequently in production, for real world purposes? As opposed  to the hobbyists? Talking to your customers is good.

如果你必须开始免费，你需要做这个分析，你是如何与用户交谈的问题实际上是严重的？你如何与那些在生产中经常使用你的产品的用户交谈，以达到真实世界的目的？而不是狂热者？和你的顾客交谈是件好事。

The talking to the wrong customers,  very, very, very bad.

和错误的顾客交谈，非常糟糕。

I've seen a lot of companies that are basically hijacked by  bad customers. Especially companies where there's real world costs. For example, if you have a  company like Poppy, there's real world cost in recruiting, managing, and working with all of  these babysitters.

我见过很多被坏客户劫持的公司。尤其是那些有真实世界成本的公司。例如，如果你有一家像Poppy这样的公司，那么招聘、管理和与所有这些保姆一起工作都需要付出很大的代价。

And if you have a customer who's trying to basically take advantage of  that system, being late, being non-responsive, being rude to the babysitters, that's not going to  help you run your business.

如果你有一个客户试图利用这个系统，迟到，反应迟钝，对保姆无礼，那对你的生意没有帮助。

And you'd be surprised at how many hijack customers there  are out there.

你会惊讶于那里有这么多劫机顾客。

The last question I always ask people is how easy is it  for your customers to find? Because inevitably you're going to need to reach them.

我一直问人们的最后一个问题是，你的客户找到它有多容易？因为不可避免的是你需要联系他们。

And  what's interesting, I look at the last batch, there were two B2B companies. One B2B  company was here in America, and it was very easy for them to find customers.  They could basically go to LinkedIn, find their customers on LinkedIn, find their email addresses,  email them.

有趣的是，我看了最后一批，有两家B2B公司。美国有一家B2B公司，他们很容易找到客户。他们基本上可以去LinkedIn，在LinkedIn上找到他们的客户，找到他们的电子邮件地址，给他们发电子邮件。

They could email 1,000 customers a week.

他们每周可以给1000名顾客发电子邮件。

The other company doing B2B was  in China.

另一家做B2B的公司是在中国。

And interestingly enough, reaching out over email on a B2B context in China  just isn't a well done practice. Getting access to those email addresses is actually not  very hard, not very easy.

有趣的是，在中国，通过电子邮件联系B2B环境并不是一个很好的实践。访问这些电子邮件地址并不是很难，也不是很容易。

And so strangely, they had this challenge of a relatively  simple business to explain, a real intense problem that happened often, yet they had no  way to reach their customers.

奇怪的是，他们面临着一个相对简单的企业所面临的挑战，这是一个经常发生的真正严重的问题，但他们却无法接触到他们的客户。

And they had to basically invent new ways to do  it.

他们必须发明新的方法来做到这一点。

And so I often want to ask those questions, because if your customers are  ridiculously hard to find, you better have a solution for that up front. You can't  build the whole thing and expect them to find you.

所以我经常想问这些问题，因为如果你的客户很难找到，你最好有个解决方案。你不能指望他们能找到你。

And so, oftentimes you've got  a situation where someone's trying to build a product for either an imaginary customer, or  a customer who can't really hope to use the product. "I'm trying to get water  to people in the middle of the desert, in the Sahara, all they need to  do is download my app, and go online, and then they can put their GPS  location, and then we'll go deliver water to them." That's not going to work. But  you'd be surprised at how many people just don't think through those logical steps.

因此，你经常会遇到这样一种情况：有人试图为一个想象中的客户，或者是一个无法真正希望使用该产品的客户，打造一款产品。“我试图给沙漠中的撒哈拉地区的人们送水，他们只需要下载我的应用，上网，然后他们就可以把GPS定位到那里，然后我们就可以给他们送水了。”那是行不通的。但你会惊讶于有多少人没有仔细考虑这些合乎逻辑的步骤。

All  right, next step. Does your MVP actually solve the problem that you want to solve?  This one is so hilarious how often it comes up. Because in the process of  building an MVP, things just go weird and swirly. So you have this problem and  then you started building it, and then you talk to other users, and then before  long, you're launching something.

好了下一步。你的MVP真的解决了你想要解决的问题吗？这个太搞笑了，它每隔一段时间就会出现一次。因为在建立MVP的过程中，事情就会变得奇怪和混乱。所以你有了这个问题，然后你开始构建它，然后你和其他用户交谈，然后不久，你就启动了一些东西。

And then you realize it doesn't actually do the thing that  you promised, or even the thing that you want to do. Part of your process  of building the MVP, it's really helpful to do these pre steps first.

然后你意识到它并没有做你承诺的事情，甚至你想做的事情。在构建MVP的过程中，首先做这些预先步骤是非常有帮助的。

It's really,  really, really helpful. Because then you can always gut check yourself on am I actually  solving the problem? The other thing is that it's really helpful to build your MVP  quickly.

真的，真的很有帮助。因为那样的话，你就可以检查自己了，我真的解决了问题吗？另外一件事是，快速构建MVP是非常有帮助的。

Typically the longer it takes, the more you're going to have MVP and problem  drift, or customer drift.

通常情况下，时间越长，MVP和问题漂移(或客户漂移)就会越多。

If you decide to only build your MVP in two weeks,  it's a lot easier to stay on task and make sure you're actually solving that  problem for that customer.

如果你决定只在两周内建立你的MVP，那就更容易留在任务上，并确保你真的在为客户解决这个问题。

The way you test this, by the way, is you give  your product to customers. You have to do that.

顺便说一句，你测试这个的方法是把你的产品交给客户。你必须这么做。

That is a required step. What  I find interesting is that a lot of people think of their product as a  painting, as something that could be appreciated as a piece of art, as something that,  even if it's appreciated by one person, is special.

这是必需的步骤。我发现有趣的是，很多人认为他们的产品是一幅画，可以作为一件艺术品来欣赏，即使是被一个人欣赏，也是一种特殊的东西。

That's not what you're making. Products  are not paintings.

这不是你要做的。产品不是绘画。

They're not art.

它们不是艺术。

If users don't find products useful, then the products,  by definition, not useful, and they're a waste of your time to build.

如果用户不认为产品有用，那么这些产品，从定义上来说，是没有用的，而且是在浪费您的时间来构建。

And I  think a lot of people want to be artists. Startup world is very unforgiving to  artists.

我想很多人都想成为艺术家。创业世界对艺术家是非常无情的。

And I think that interestingly, after the fact a lot of people are painted  as artists, right? Like Steve Jobs is painted as this magical artist, right? At the  end of the day, you get to figure out how to make a phone that  millions of people would buy.

我认为有趣的是，在这个事实之后，很多人被描绘成艺术家，对吗？就像史蒂夫·乔布斯被描绘成这位神奇的艺术家，对吧？在一天结束的时候，你要想办法制造出一部数以百万计的人都会买的手机。

If only one person bought the iPhone, he would be  seen as a failure.

如果只有一个人买了iPhone，他就会被视为失败。

The definition of art is it only has to be appreciated  by one, or maybe even none.

艺术的定义是，它只需要被一个人欣赏，甚至没有一个。

That's not the appreciate ... Maybe just the creator.  That's not the definition of a successful product.

这不是感激.。也许只有创造者。这不是成功产品的定义。

This is what you should always be  gut checking. Does your MVP solve a problem? The number one problem with this question  is that it hurts, the answer hurts. You're going to find that a lot in  startups, where the answer hurts. You know it doesn't solve the problem, but as long  as we don't talk about it, maybe nobody knows it doesn't solve the problem.

这就是你应该经常检查的东西。你的MVP解决问题了吗？这个问题的首要问题是它很痛，答案也很痛。在创业公司，你会发现很多这样的问题，答案会让你很伤心。你知道它不能解决问题，但只要我们不谈，也许没人知道它解决不了问题。

A  lot of the answers inside of startups feel that way. Which customer should you go  after first? A lot of founders are very confused by this question. What I find  interesting is just like the instinct is to go after customers by making the product  free, for some reason I find a lot of people think that their instincts should  be to go after the hardest customers first.

很多创业公司内部的答案都是这样的。你应该先找哪个顾客？很多创始人都被这个问题弄糊涂了。我发现有趣的是，我的直觉是通过免费的产品来追求顾客，出于某种原因，我发现很多人认为他们的本能应该是先去找最难的顾客。

Almost as if it's like a proof,  like if I can get this impossible person to use something, then it'll be easier  ...

就像一个证据，就像我能让这个不可能的人用什么东西，那就更容易了.

I know that I've made something good.

我知道我做了些好事。

I like to start from a different  point.

我喜欢从另一个角度开始。

It's an MVP. You know you've made something bad.

是MVP。你知道你做了坏事。

That's the definition of MVP,  it's bad.

这是MVP的定义，很糟糕。

The real question is how do you find people who are willing to  use a bad product? Right? They have to be the most desperate, the most desperate.  And so a lot of times when I talk to founders I really push them  towards who are the most desperate customers, and how do you talk to them first?  That's what I define as easy, desperate.

真正的问题是你如何找到愿意使用劣质产品的人？对吗？他们必须是最绝望的，最绝望的。因此，很多时候，当我和创始人交谈时，我真的把他们逼向谁是最绝望的客户，你是如何首先与他们交谈的？这就是我定义的简单绝望。

If you're having a ...

如果你有.。

If you're trying  to sell a simple piece of software to someone, $1,000 a month, and you're engaged  in a six month conversation with the company, that's not a desperate company. Move on.  In fact, when you're doing enterprise sales early as a startup, you're looking for even  more desperate customers, just because it literally takes so long to sell them.

如果你想把一个简单的软件卖给某个人，每月1000美元，而且你和公司进行了6个月的谈话，那就不是一个绝望的公司。往前走事实上，当你在创业初期做企业销售的时候，你就在寻找更多绝望的客户，仅仅是因为你花了那么长时间才能把他们卖出去。

If you  don't feel like you're dealing with desperate people, if you feel like you don't ...  you are trying to get impressive customers who aren't desperate, you're probably doing it wrong.  Literally the number one thing I often tell founders, just like, whose business is going  to go out of business without using you? Which people out there are not going  to be able to get to work, or to watch their kids? How do you  find the people who are just literally screaming for something like this? And then how  do you talk to them, and not talk to your friends? I had a whole  bunch of friends who were using Socialcam, right? My company was doing a video for  sharing with friends.

如果你不觉得你在和绝望的人打交道，如果你觉得你不.你正在努力吸引那些不绝望的令人印象深刻的客户，你可能做错了。实际上，我经常对创始人说的第一件事就是，谁的公司会在不使用你的情况下倒闭？哪些人不能上班，或者不能照看他们的孩子？你怎么能找到那些真的在为这样的事情尖叫的人呢？然后你怎么和他们说话，而不是和你的朋友说话？我有很多朋友都在用社交摄像头，对吧？我的公司做了一个视频和朋友分享。

And they weren't really using it, they were using it because it  was my app and they were friends with me.

他们没有真正使用它，他们使用它是因为这是我的应用程序，他们是我的朋友。

I literally have one friend was  super honest about this. Steve, the CEO of Reddit. When we sold Socialcam, he literally  said, "Thank, god. Now I can delete this app from my phone." The perfect definition  of someone you should be trying to get product feedback from, right? And so he  didn't have the problem we were solving. Many of your friends won't have the problem  that you're solving. Make sure you find the ...

我真的有一个朋友对这件事非常诚实。史蒂夫，Reddit的首席执行官。当我们出售Social摄像头时，他直截了当地说：“谢天谢地，现在我可以从手机上删除这个应用程序了。”完美定义的人，你应该试图从产品反馈，对吗？所以他没有我们要解决的问题。你的许多朋友不会有你正在解决的问题。确保你找到.。

And by the way, the kind  of community of startup people, and/or investors, usually don't have the problem that you're solving.  So if you're using investors as a trigger for am I solving the right problem,  or do they find this useful? It's almost never the case.

顺便说一句，创业人士和/或投资者的社区通常没有你要解决的问题。所以，如果你利用投资者作为触发因素，我是在解决正确的问题，还是他们认为这是有用的？几乎从来都不是这样的。

It's almost never the  user of a product that comes into YC.

它几乎从来不是一个产品的用户进入YC。

And so ignore your investors, ignore your  friends.

所以忽略你的投资者，忽略你的朋友。

They will lead you 100% astray. Out of good intentions, they'll try to be  helpful. Well like, "I've never lived in the Sahara.

他们会使你100%误入歧途。出于好意，他们会尽力提供帮助。就像，“我从没住过撒哈拉沙漠。

I've never been thirsty. But maybe  it should would like this," right? But it's horrible. Run away. Run away. Once you  start having customers, I think it's a very helpful exercise to try early to identify  bad customers.

我从来没口渴过。但是也许它应该会喜欢这个，“是吗？但这太可怕了。逃跑。一旦你开始有顾客，我认为这是一个非常有益的练习，尝试及早发现坏顾客。

These are people who are blasting your support.

这些人在炮轰你的支持。

These are people who are  constantly complaining. My co-founder, Justin, he had a company that was basically on-demand personal assistant.  And he was the first who I met who actively fired a customer.

这些人经常抱怨。我的联合创始人贾斯汀，他有一家基本上是按需个人助理的公司。他是我认识的第一个主动解雇顾客的人。

It was  basically like Uber for personal assistants.

这基本上就像是私人助理的优步(Uber)。

It was called Exec.

它叫做Exec。

And literally, a customer would  have the Exec do something like crazy, like something you couldn't do, right? Like, "Reorganize  my house the way I want things organized, and I'm not going to tell you  how I want them organized", or, "Go shopping for me, but I'm going to critique  every single piece of fruit and vegetable that you picked out." It was like completely  unrealistic expectations.

从字面上讲，客户会让Exec做一些疯狂的事情，比如你做不到的事情，对吗？比如，“以我想要的方式整理我的房子，我不会告诉你我希望它们是如何组织起来的”，或者，“去给我买东西，但是我要批评你挑选的每一块水果和蔬菜。”这就像是完全不切实际的期望。

And so after refunding the person four times, four different tasks, the person  did a fifth task on the product, right? Because he's getting a bunch of value  for free.

所以在给这个人四次，四次不同的任务之后，这个人在这个产品上做了第五个任务，对吗？因为他免费得到了一堆价值。

And Justin calls him and says, "You're fired. You can't ever use the  product again." Look for those people, because if you are delivering anything of value, there  will be people trying to exploit that value.

贾斯汀打电话给他说：“你被解雇了，你再也不能使用这种产品了。”寻找那些人，因为如果你提供任何有价值的东西，就会有人试图利用这些价值。

And some might be doing it not  out of the goodness of their heart. So don't let these people lead you astray.  We already talked about this, don't discount. Now, here's a caveat on discounting. Parker for  Zenefits came to YC a couple years ago, and he gave this great talk about  enterprise sales.

有些人这样做可能不是出于他们内心的善良。所以别让这些人让你误入歧途。我们已经谈过了，别打折扣。现在，这里有一个贴现的警告。Zenefits的帕克几年前来到YC，他做了关于企业销售的精彩演讲。

And Zenefits, his product, is given away for free.

他的产品Zenefits是免费赠送的。

It's actually kind of  an interesting enterprise sale.

这实际上是一种有趣的企业销售。

And one of the things he said that really got to  me was that there are ways to convince organizations, basically you can structure discounts and  incentives into your sales pitch, if you basically understand what value you're getting back. So  his example was he would try to sell to a company to switch on to  Zenefits for their healthcare.

他说的其中一件事真正打动了我，那就是有办法说服组织，基本上你可以在你的销售推销中安排折扣和激励，如果你基本上知道你得到的是什么价值的话。因此，他的例子是，他会试图出售给一家公司，转而购买Zenefits的医疗保健服务。

And he would say, "Look, because of this third party," let's  just say AWS, "has given us a discount," who know why, right? "We just bought  Dedicated Instances, so now we 40% lower AWS bills, so we can actually pass on  some benefit to you. But only for the next 30 days. Now, I feel horrible  even telling you this, because I want you to take as much time as you  need to buy my product.

他会说，“因为这个第三方，”我们就说AWS，“给了我们一个折扣，”谁知道为什么，对吧？“我们刚刚购买了专门的例子，所以现在我们降低了40%的AWS账单，这样我们就可以把一些好处转嫁给你。但只在接下来的30天。现在，我甚至告诉你这件事，我都觉得很可怕，因为我希望你花足够多的时间来购买我的产品。”

I would just hate if you bought it on the  31st day and I couldn't give you this discount." Now, this isn't a let me  give this away free, because I'm afraid people won't use it.

我讨厌你在第31天买的，但我不能给你这个折扣。“现在，这不是让我免费赠送它，因为我怕人们不会使用它。

This is a very  structured process that he did. He basically incorporated a deadline, based on some third party  providing a benefit to the customer.

这是他所做的一个非常有条理的过程。他基本上采用了一个最后期限，基于某个第三方为客户提供的利益。

And he know that when he said this to  the customer, every time that this was talked about internally, the deadline would be brought  up, and the discount would be brought up.

他知道，当他对客户说这句话的时候，每一次内部讨论的时候，最后期限都会被提出来，折扣也会被提出来。

And suddenly this is now become, not  a way to be afraid, right, to, "Oh, I'm not sure if I'm going to  get customers.

突然之间，这就变成了，不是一种害怕的方式，对吧，“哦，我不确定我是否会得到顾客。”

I'm going to just make it free," it became a way to speed  up the process.

我要让它自由，“它成为了一种加快进程的方式。

And his discount was just baked in. He just priced the product  15% higher.

而且他的折扣也刚刚到期。他刚给这个产品定价高了15%。

It's literally like that is the way to do it.

从字面上说，这就是做这件事的方法。

The way not  to do it is, "I'm afraid no one's going to use and so I have  to not charge any money." Okay.

不这样做的方法是，“恐怕没有人要用，所以我必须不收任何钱。”好的。

The next is how to set up metrics. How  many of you are using Google Analytics as your primary metrics spot? Raise your hands.  Okay. You are doing it wrong. Yes. Setting a metrics is something that's super important  very early in your company, because it's how you know whether your product is being  used or not.

下一个是如何设置度量。你们中有多少人使用GoogleAnalytics作为主要的度量点？举手。好的。你做错了。是在您的公司早期，设置度量是非常重要的事情，因为它是如何知道您的产品是否被使用的。

And it's one of the number one sources of new product ideas  and inspiration. Google Analytics, I would say, is a great product for knowing how many  people came to your website today, and how many pages they viewed, which used to  be relevant, but it's not really relevant anymore, and where they came from. What it's  not a great product for is identifying what people's actions were when they were using  your product. Did they click this button? Did they see this screen? How long were  they on the page for before they did something else? Did they leave something in  their cart? For all of those things you want an events based metrics product. Mixpanel,  Amplitude, Heap.

它是新产品创意和灵感的主要来源之一。我想说的是，Google Analytics是一个很好的产品，可以知道今天有多少人访问了你的网站，他们浏览了多少页面，这些页面过去都是相关的，但现在已经不相关了，他们从哪里来的。它并不是一个伟大的产品，因为它能识别人们在使用你的产品时的行为。他们按了这个按钮吗？他们看到这个屏幕了吗？在做其他事情之前，他们在页面上呆了多久？他们在车里留了什么东西吗？对于所有这些事情，您需要一个基于事件的度量产品。混合面板，振幅，堆。

I think we funded like 50 of them.

我想我们资助了他们中的50人。

There are like 100 of  them out there. You should be using one of them.

大约有100人在那里。你应该使用其中之一。

If you're not, you can't  be sophisticated at building your product.

如果你不是，你就不可能在制造你的产品方面变得老练。

It's just kind of a prerequisite. So get on  it.

这只是个先决条件。那就开始吧。

And this goes back to the early thing that I mentioned, which is technical  teams. For a technical team, implementing Mixpanel is ridiculously easy. For a non-technical team, it's  basically impossible.

这可以追溯到我提到的早期的事情，也就是技术团队。对于一个技术团队来说，实现MixPanel非常容易。对于非技术团队来说，这基本上是不可能的。

This is just one of the many advantages of having a highly technical  team. You actually know what your users are doing. Without this, you're just missing a  huge part of what you need to know.

这只是拥有一支高技术团队的众多优势之一。你其实知道你的用户在做什么。如果没有这个，你就会失去你需要知道的大部分。

The next thing, and Suhail from Mixpanel  gave a great talk about how do you setup Mixpanel? One of the challenges of  setting up Mixpanel is the second that you're sitting there saying I want to track  what my users are doing, you can up with 150 things your users can use  do with your product, and you want to track all of them.

接下来，来自MixPanel的Suhael给出了一个很棒的演讲，您是如何设置MixPanel的？设置MixPanel的挑战之一是，第二个你坐在那里说我想跟踪我的用户在做什么，你可以用150件你的用户可以用你的产品做的事情，你想要追踪他们的全部。

That's often a  mistake.

这经常是个错误。

If your analytics product has got too many analytics sitting in it in the  beginning, it will be hard to use.

如果你的分析产品在一开始就有太多的分析方法，那就很难使用了。

And part of what you're doing, if you've  never used product like Mixpanel before, is learning how to use it.

如果您以前从未使用过像MixPanel这样的产品，那么您所做的部分工作就是学习如何使用它。

And most importantly,  teaching your employees and your co-founders how to use it. Because this product should be  a product that everyone in your company understands how to use. Because everyone in your  company should understand how the product is functioning.

最重要的是，教你的员工和联合创始人如何使用它。因为这个产品应该是你公司里每个人都知道如何使用的产品。因为你们公司的每个人都应该了解产品是如何运作的。

This is not something that the CTO  used and creates reports from.

这不是CTO使用和创建报告的东西。

This is an interactive product that everyone can use.

这是一个互动的产品，每个人都可以使用。

To  start, pick five to ten simple stats. Let's take Instagram as an example, right? If  I went to pick five to ten simple stats for Instagram, let's say open the  app, creating an account, took a photo, applied an effects, shared the photo.

首先，选择五到十个简单的统计数据。让我们以Instagram为例，对吧？如果我为Instagram选择5到10个简单的统计数据，比如说打开应用程序，创建一个帐户，拍照，应用效果，分享照片。

That's probably  all I need in the beginning. Right? I mean, the number one mechanism for Instagram  is taking a photo and sharing it.

这可能是我刚开始所需要的。对吗？我的意思是，Instagram的首要机制是拍照并分享。

I can track that, I'm pretty happy.

我能追踪到，我很高兴。

The  other thing that I will warn you about is that if your product is good,  the naming conventions for these stats are going to become very important, because one day  there will be 100, or even 1,000 stats you track.

我要提醒大家的另一件事是，如果你的产品是好的，这些统计数据的命名约定将变得非常重要，因为总有一天你会跟踪100个，甚至1000个统计数据。

Think a little bit ahead  of time, and don't name something, something that only you'll understand. Make sure that you  ...

提前思考，不要说出一些只有你才能理解的东西。确保你.。

If your company's good, many, many people will have to look at these stats.  Make measurement a part of your product spec. Oftentimes when I talk to founders they  say, "We built it on this release and we'll add the measurement some point in  the future." I don't understand how that works. You built something you want people to  use, but you're not incorporating the measurement that tells you whether people are using it.  That doesn't work. Building measurement is part of product spec. When you spec out a  product, you better spec the stats you expect to be tracking, and you should also  spec the stats that you think are going to improve when you're building that product.  That should be part of the spec, which should be part of the first release.  Otherwise, you're flying blind.

如果你的公司很好，很多人将不得不看这些数据。将测量作为产品规格的一部分。通常，当我和创始人交谈时，他们会说：“我们是在这个版本上建立的，将来我们会在某个点上添加测量值。”我不明白那是怎么回事。你构建了一些你想让人们使用的东西，但是你并没有把这个度量方法结合起来，来告诉你人们是否在使用它。那不管用。建筑测量是产品规范的一部分。当您指定一个产品时，您最好说明您期望跟踪的统计数据，并且您还应该说明您认为在构建该产品时会改进的统计数据。这应该是规范的一部分，而规范应该是第一个版本的一部分。否则你就瞎飞了。

And this is just countless times at Justin.tv this has screwed  us. Okay. Product development cycle. Justin.tv was and Twitch was three Yale kids and one  MIT kid.

这在Justin.tv上已经无数次了，这已经把我们搞砸了。好的。产品开发周期Justin.tv和Twitc是耶鲁的三个孩子和麻省理工学院的一个孩子。

At Yale probably the most productive skill you are taught is how to  argue with other Yale kids.

在耶鲁，你所学到的最有效率的技能可能是如何与其他耶鲁孩子争论。

And so the number one way to get product developed  at Justin.tv was to win an argument with the three Yale kids. Kyle disliked this  so much that he actually switched his sleeping schedule so that he wouldn't have to  be involved in those arguments. So we were awake from about 8:00 AM to about  12:00 midnight. He would wake up around 11:00, midnight and write code all night, and  then go to sleep in the morning so he wouldn't have to argue with us  on what stupid thing that failed. One of the classic arguments at Justin.tv that lasted  approximately three months was the background color for the original site.

因此，在Justin.tv开发产品的首要方法是赢得与耶鲁三个孩子的争论。凯尔非常不喜欢这样，所以他实际上改变了他的睡眠时间，这样他就不必卷入这些争论了。所以我们从早上8点到午夜12点都醒了。他会在11：00，午夜左右醒来，写一整晚的代码，然后在早上睡觉，这样他就不用和我们争论什么愚蠢的事情失败了。Justin.tv持续了大约三个月的经典论点之一是原址的背景颜色。

The original site's just  one page. Justin wanted a black background.

原来的网站只有一页。贾斯汀想要一个黑色背景。

I wanted a wood grain background.

我想要一个木纹背景。

Three months  debate, we settled on changeable backgrounds. So there were five background options. Clearly idiotic. Like  I said, we make many of these mistakes. We didn't actually really learn how to  product development cycle until we failed at it for about five or so years.

三个月的辩论，我们决定了多变的背景。所以有五种背景选择。很明显是白痴。就像我说的，我们犯了很多错误。我们实际上并没有真正学会如何产品开发周期，直到我们在这方面失败了大约五年左右。

And  during that time, this is what bad product development cycle looks like. One, we would  release every three months. For a web only product that is horrible. Second, we would  have a product meeting, and we wouldn't write anything down, right? It was just four  of us. Can't you remember? You're an idiot if you can't remember a conversation four  people had, right? And if you forget something, just ask one of the other four  people in the room, right? No. So as a result, during the first month of  the dev cycle, we'd all go off working on slightly different versions of the thing  we wanted to develop, because we didn't write down the spec.

在这段时间里，这就是糟糕的产品开发周期。第一，我们每三个月释放一次。对于一个只有网络的产品是可怕的。第二，我们将举行一个产品会议，我们不会写下任何东西，对吗？只有我们四个人。你不记得了吗？如果你记不起四个人的谈话，你就是个白痴，对吧？如果你忘了什么，就问问房间里其他四个人中的一个，对吧？否因此，在开发周期的第一个月，我们都会停止开发我们想要开发的东西的稍微不同的版本，因为我们没有编写规范。

Then at the end  of that month, we'd come together and we'd be like, "Oh, wait.

然后在那个月底，我们走到一起，我们会说，“哦，等等。

This isn't ...  We're not really building all the same thing." And then we'd have another product meeting,  where we didn't write anything down, and go off and build again for another month.  At this point, right, two months in, we probably have about three weeks of productivity,  and about five weeks of just stuff that's going to have to be thrown away.  At this point in, we come back together and realize that we're not two thirds  of the way done through this sprint, we're less than one third of the way  done.

这不是.。我们并不是真的在建造同样的东西。“然后我们会举行另一次产品会议，在会上我们什么都没写，然后再开个月再建一次。在这一点上，是的，两个月后，我们可能有大约三个星期的生产力，和大约五个星期的仅仅是要扔掉的东西。在这一点上，我们回到一起，并意识到，我们不是三分之二的方式通过这个冲刺，我们不到三分之一的方式完成。

And we're starting to get sick and tired of this feature that we're building.  So then we basically say, "All right, slash and burn. Let's just make a shitty  version of it." And we take another month to do that. Now we've worked on  this product for three months.

我们开始对我们正在构建的这个功能感到厌倦了。所以我们基本上是说，“好吧，切一下，烧了。让我们做一个糟糕的版本吧。”我们还需要一个月的时间。现在我们已经在这个产品上做了三个月了。

If you had any good, or new, or interesting ideas  during that three month period of time, you were told, "We're already working on something  else, so your ideas are worthless. Just write it down somewhere. Whatever. We're working on  this thing right now." At the end of the three months, instead of wanting to  iterate, we were sick of the god damn feature we just spent three months building  poorly. So we would launch it and if it wasn't used right away, we would  come up with some new brainstorm on brand new feature that would rescue the company.  This is the wrong way to run a company.

如果你在这三个月的时间里有任何好的，新的，有趣的想法，你会被告知，“我们已经在做其他的事情了，所以你的想法是毫无价值的。只要把它写下来。随便吧。我们现在正在研究这件事。”在这三个月的最后，我们不想迭代，而是厌倦了我们刚刚花了三个月时间来构建的那个该死的特性。因此，我们将推出它，如果它不立即使用，我们会想出一些新的头脑风暴的全新功能，以拯救公司。这是经营公司的错误方式。

It was absolutely horrible.

太可怕了。

I was  talking to Jeff earlier, the major product decisions that Justin.tv made, that carried through to  Twitch to today, was chat on the right video on the left. We decided that  in 2006.

我之前和Jeff谈过，Justin.tv做出的主要产品决定，一直延续到今天，就是在左边的右边视频上聊天。我们在2006年决定。

It the same way in 2018.

2018年也是如此。

The vast majority of the product decisions  we made were horrible and never saw the light of day, because they went through  a process like this.

我们所做的绝大多数产品决策都是可怕的，从未见过光明，因为他们经历了这样一个过程。

If your process revolves around arguing, revolves around not writing spec,  revolves around long dev cycles, you are doing it wrong. You are 100% doing it  wrong. What I'm going to give you is a model of how we figured out  how to solve the problem. Steal as much or as little of this as you  want, but understand that if you have any of the symptoms I'm talking about, you  need to solve them, or else your company is just going to be much less  productive than it could have been. First, you need to actually have a number that  you track that reflects how good your company is doing.

如果您的过程是围绕争论，围绕不编写规范，围绕着长开发周期，那么您做错了。你是百分之百地做错了。我要给你们的是一个我们如何解决这个问题的模型。想偷多少就偷多少，但是要明白，如果你有我所说的任何症状，你就需要解决它们，否则你的公司就会变得比它本来的效率低得多。首先，你需要有一个能反映你的公司业绩的数字。

Almost always, if you ever  are going to charge money to your customers, this number should be revenue.

几乎总是，如果你要向你的客户收取钱，这个数字应该是收入。

Almost always.  If you are never going to charge your customers money, like Facebook, then maybe it  should be a usage base metric, like how often do your customers come back every  day, like DAUs.

几乎总是。如果你永远不会像Facebook那样向客户收费，那么也许它应该是一个使用基准指标，就像你的客户每天回来的频率一样，比如DAU。

It is almost always one of those two. Usage if you will  never charge the customers. Money if you will charge the customers. Many people will invest  reasons why these two metrics don't apply to their business. 1% of them might be  right, and 99% of them are probably wrong. Whatever this KPI goal is, make sure  that you're measuring it, make sure that everyone in your company knows what this goal  is every day. Helpful to put it on some screen somewhere.

它几乎总是这两种中的一种。如果你永远不会向顾客收费的话，就使用它。如果你要向顾客收费的话。许多人会为这两种指标不适用于他们的业务而进行投资。他们中的1%可能是对的，99%的人可能是错的。不管这个KPI目标是什么，确保你在测量它，确保你公司里的每个人每天都知道这个目标是什么。把它放在某个屏幕上很有帮助。

If an investor asks  you what your KPI is, you not only should be able to way what it  is, you should be able to say what the metric is, but say where the  metric is now, where it was three months ago, where it was when you started.  This is table stakes.

如果一个投资者问你的KPI是什么，你不仅应该知道它是什么，你还应该能够说出这个指标是什么，还应该说出这个指标现在哪里，三个月前在哪里，你开始的时候在哪里。这是桌子上的木桩。

The next thing that we would do is, as a product  person, I would come into the meeting, and I would say, this is the KPI  we're looking to improve this cycle.

接下来我们要做的是，作为一个产品人员，我会参加会议，我会说，这就是我们希望改善这个周期的KPI。

At Socialcam, the top level KPI was DAUs.

在SocialCAM，最高级别的KPI是DAU。

And  the three ways that we thought we contributed to DAUs was either new users, retention  of users, new content created.

我们认为我们为DAU做出贡献的三种方式要么是新用户，要么是保留用户，要么是创建新内容。

Those three things. Every cycle we ran, one of those  three numbers, moving that number to the right direction, was the goal.

这三件事。我们运行的每一个周期，这三个数字中的一个，将这个数字推向正确的方向，是我们的目标。

And we'd run  an open brainstorm. Brainstorm for us would take a couple hours.

我们会组织一个公开的头脑风暴。头脑风暴对我们来说需要几个小时。

And it was a  real brainstorm.

这是一场真正的头脑风暴。

It wasn't a brainstorm where you say, "What about this", and your co-founder  says, "That's a dumb idea." That's not a brainstorm. Real brainstorm is that any idea  that's stated is written on the board.

这不是一个头脑风暴，你说，“这是什么”，你的共同创始人说，“这是一个愚蠢的想法。”那不是头脑风暴。真正的头脑风暴是，任何陈述的想法都写在董事会上。

The cool thing about these brainstorms is that  everyone's computers were always open to Mixpanel. So if you had an idea or you  had a thought, you could always just go in and check the metrics and see  like, "Oh, is that right, or is that wrong?" You'd be surprised at how much  value there in seeing your idea on the board. Not everyone's going to get to  have built what they want to have built, but the fact that your idea was  considered and added to the board, actually makes people feel a lot better than otherwise.  People feel horrible when their ideas are shot down. CEOs, their job is to make  their employees not feel horrible all the time. Sometimes I think CEOs think their job  is to shoot down ideas.

这些头脑风暴的酷之处在于，每个人的电脑都向MixPanel开放。所以，如果你有一个想法或者你有一个想法，你总是可以进去检查指标，然后看到，“哦，这是对的，还是错的？”你会惊讶于在董事会上看到你的想法有多大的价值。并不是每个人都能建造他们想要建造的东西，但是事实上，你的想法被考虑并加入董事会，实际上让人们感觉好多了。当他们的想法被否决时，人们感到很可怕。CEO们，他们的工作就是让他们的员工不会一直感觉糟糕。有时候，我认为首席执行官们的工作就是将想法付诸实践。

It's not.

不是的。

It's not going to help you at all.  And everyone, by the way, in our company participated in this brainstorm.

对你一点帮助都没有。顺便说一句，我们公司里的每个人都参加了这次头脑风暴。

At that point,  that was four people, so easy to do.

在那个时候，那是四个人，所以很容易做。

The next thing was we did what's  called easy, medium, hard. Our brainstorm was actually typically split up into three categories: new  features or iterations on existing ones, bug fixes and/or other maintenance, and tests, AV test  we wanted to run. We would have a whole board filled out with ideas on  these three categories.

第二件事是我们做了一件所谓的简单，中等，艰难的事情。我们的头脑风暴通常分为三类：新特性或现有特性的迭代、bug修复和/或其他维护，以及我们想要运行的测试、AV测试。我们将有一个完整的董事会对这三个类别的想法。

And then we'd go through and do what's called easy, medium, hard.  For us, hard meant it would take one engineer most of the dev cycle to  develop. Medium typically meant it would take a day, two days. Easy means we could  do multiple in a day.

然后我们会做一件所谓的简单，中等，艰难的事情。对我们来说，艰难意味着开发周期的大部分时间都需要一个工程师。中等标准意味着它需要一天，两天。简单就意味着我们一天可以做多次。

This is extremely important. How many of you in this  room do not know how to write code? Raise their hands.

这是非常重要的。在座有多少人不知道怎么写代码？举起手来。

There we go.

开始吧。

I  am one of you.

我是你们中的一员。

It's extremely hard if you don't know how to write code  to figure out whether your idea is easy to build or hard to build.

如果您不知道如何编写代码来确定您的想法是易于构建还是很难构建，这是非常困难的。

That's  something that you actually learn as a skill over time.

随着时间的推移，这是你真正学到的技能。

And this process basically is  the process that can help educate you.

这个过程基本上是一个可以帮助你教育你的过程。

It turns out that easy ideas get built  way faster, way more quickly, than hard ideas.

事实证明，简单的想法比硬想法更快，更快。

And it turns out that most hard  ideas can be restated as an easy idea if you just understand what bits of  your hard idea are both useless and hard.

事实证明，大多数困难的想法都可以被重新表述为一个简单的想法，如果你只知道你的艰难想法中的哪些部分是无用的和困难的。

And most of the time there are  useless and hard bits in hard ideas that can just be removed.

在大多数情况下，硬想法中有一些无用的和困难的部分，它们可以被移除。

And so for  us, this was educating everyone on the team, and for us being a cross functional  team, so someone might not realize that this is really hard on the video system.  It might be an easy web feature, but hard for the video system, or vice  versa. So this is basically educating everyone on the team on what's easy, medium, hard.  It also created an objective standard by which to start thinking about these ideas.

对我们来说，这是在教育团队中的每一个人，对我们来说是一个跨功能的团队，所以有人可能不会意识到这在视频系统中真的很难。这可能是一个简单的网页功能，但对视频系统来说很难，反之亦然。所以这基本上是在教育团队中的每一个人什么是容易的，中等的，困难的。它还创造了一个客观的标准来开始思考这些想法。

Instead  of just based on the argument ability of the person delivering them, it was like,  "Well, your idea is like really fricking hard and it seems like it wouldn't move  the numbers that much based on Mixpanel. Whereas, this other person's idea is super easy  and probably can move numbers a lot." The next thing we would do is we'd  decide hard first. So we'd look at all the hards, and we'd say, "Which hard  is going to impact the KPI the most?" And then we'd move to easys, and  then we'd move to ...

而不是仅仅基于发送者的论证能力，而是说，“你的想法就像真的很难，而且它似乎不会在混合面板上移动那么多的数字。然而，另一个人的想法非常容易，而且很可能可以移动很多数字。”下一件我们要做的事就是先做艰难的决定。所以我们会看看所有的硬汉，我们会说，“哪种力量会对KPI产生最大的影响？”然后我们搬到舒适的地方，然后搬到.

I'm sorry, then we'd move to mediums, and then we'd  move to easys. What was interesting is that just with the ideas on the board,  and with easy, medium, hard, a lot of the ego was removed from the debate.  Because one, you knew your idea had been considered.

对不起，那我们就搬到灵媒那里去，然后再搬到轻松的地方去。有趣的是，仅仅有了董事会上的想法，加上简单、中等、艰难，很多自我都从辩论中消失了。因为第一，你知道你的想法已经被考虑过了。

And two, you saw someone object  and measure about how hard is was.

第二，你看到有人反对和衡量有多难。

And three, because the board has a bunch  of ideas on it now.

第三，因为董事会现在有很多想法。

It's probably pretty easy for you to find an easy  idea that you really like.

对你来说，很容易找到一个你真正喜欢的简单的想法。

And so you're just going to be excited that that's  probably going to get in and your really hard idea, that's fine if it doesn't.  The next step is you have to write the spec.

所以你会很兴奋，因为这很可能会出现，你的想法很难，如果没有的话，那也没关系。下一步是您必须编写规范。

This is where everyone fucks  up.

这是每个人都搞砸的地方。

The meeting might be going on for four hours now, and this is the  step no one likes. You actually go through and you actually write down what do  we mean by we're adding video filters to Socialcam? What do we mean by we're  allowing people in Justin.tv and Twitch to chat with one another? What does that actually  mean? How is it going to work? This is really important.

会议可能会持续四个小时，这是没有人喜欢的步骤。你真的通过了，你写下来了，这是什么意思，我们给Social摄像头增加了视频过滤器？我们允许Justin.tv和Twite上的人互相聊天是什么意思？那到底是什么意思？它会怎样工作？这真的很重要。

And once this is  done, you can distribute tasks to the team. Now, we would run these cycles every  two weeks at Socialcam, because back then submitting to the App Store took longer.

一旦完成了这个任务，您就可以将任务分发给团队。现在，我们将每两周在SocialCAM运行这些周期，因为那时提交应用商店花费的时间更长。

If  you're doing a pure web product, you can run these cycles once a week.

如果您正在做一个纯Web产品，您可以每周运行这些循环一次。

The  rule that we had to make the team not hate these really long meetings ...  This was the only meeting we had.

我们必须让球队不要讨厌这么长时间的会议.这是我们唯一的会面。

This is the only meeting.

这是唯一的会议。

And so it  might take two hours, it might take six, but for that two week period of  time, there were no other meetings.

所以它可能需要两个小时，可能需要六个小时，但是在这两个星期的时间里，没有其他的会议。

In fact, for me, being a non-coder, my number  one job was to shut the fuck up, because I could create a problem, right?  We're busy working, we have this written spec, everyone knows what they're doing.

事实上，对我来说，作为一个非编码者，我的首要工作就是闭嘴，因为我可能会制造问题，对吗？我们正忙着工作，我们有一个书面的规范，每个人都知道他们在做什么。

If I  some brilliant idea during that two weeks, right, that'll throw the whole thing into chaos.  Suddenly, written spec's not important. We're back to the drawing board, or we're changing things,  yada, yada, yada. What I had to realize is that every two weeks we do  this over again. So remember that burning idea? Just fucking wait two weeks, and we're  going to have the meeting again.

如果我在那两周里有个绝妙的主意，对，那会把整件事搞得一团糟。突然间，书面规范就不重要了。我们又回到了画板上，或者我们正在改变一些东西，Yada，Yada。我不得不意识到每隔两周我们就会重蹈覆辙。还记得那个燃烧的想法吗？他妈的等两个星期，我们又要开会了。

And then you can get it in.

然后你就可以进去了。

And it  turns out, your burning idea's probably wrong. So it's totally fine to wait two weeks  to try to convince people to do something wrong.

事实证明，你的想法可能是错误的。所以等两周试着说服别人做错事是完全可以的。

It's totally fine.

完全没问题。

As opposed to  having this cadence met every two weeks, we had success. Every two weeks if we  built what we said we were going to build, we felt good.

与每两周举行一次这种节奏会议不同，我们取得了成功。如果我们每两周建一次我们说要建的房子，我们就会感觉很好。

And then that  cadence meant that we'd go into the next cycle and do even more.

然后，这种节奏意味着我们将进入下一个周期，做更多的事情。

This cadence  is extremely important, because it's going to take you guys a long time to find  product market fit. You'll be trying a lot of things.

这种节奏非常重要，因为你们需要很长时间才能找到合适的产品市场。你会尝试很多事情。

I mean, iterating a lot.  And if that process doesn't feel fun, you're going to be very frustrated.

我是说，重复了很多次。如果这个过程不好玩，你会很沮丧的。

This made  the process feel fun, because we had goals, and we accomplished them. Pivot versus iterate.  A lot of YC companies, a lot of founders in general, will tell me, "Our  thing isn't working.

这让我们觉得这个过程很有趣，因为我们有目标，我们完成了目标。枢轴和迭代。很多YC公司，很多创始人都会告诉我，“我们的计划不管用。

It's been two months.

https://tmt.ap-hongkong.tencentcloudapi.com/?Action=TextTranslate&Nonce=1234&ProjectId=1257710951&Region=ap-hongkong&SecretId=AKIDt9Vo18v2oQs9FAgUVMrOtEUccSIyqp3K&Source=en&SourceText=It%27s+been+two+months.&Target=zh&Timestamp=1549349462&Version=2018-03-21&Signature=Yq96is0pajERPdczR1QoJKeTpNs=

It's time to pivot." When I think about  that statement, it blows my mind, right? You're building a new product for a customer  who might not of ever used the product before. You're oftentimes exploring that you only  know to some degree, or you only experienced it personally. What makes you think two  months is enough time to know whether you've figured something out? What impressive thing only  took two months to build? If you're not thinking that the process of coming up  with a solution for this problem is probably a little more like a two year  process, you're doing it wrong.

是时候转向了。“当我想到那句话的时候，我就会大吃一惊，对吧？您正在为可能从未使用过该产品的客户构建新产品。你经常在探索，你只知道某种程度，或者你只是亲身经历过。你凭什么认为两个月的时间足以知道你是否想出了什么？什么令人印象深刻的东西只用了两个月就建成了？如果你不认为这个问题找到一个解决方案的过程可能更像是一个两年的过程，你就错了。

If you are unsatisfied with significant progress in under two  years, you're probably doing it wrong.

如果你对两年内的重大进步不满意，你可能做错了。

It's going to take time. You're doing something hard.  If it was really easy, someone else would have done it.

这需要时间。你在做些艰难的事。如果真的很容易的话，别人也会这么做的。

I define pivot as  changing the customer or changing the problem.

我将枢轴定义为改变客户或改变问题。

This should be rare.

这应该是罕见的。

This should happen infrequently.  Many times this means you should start a new company.

这种情况不应该经常发生。很多时候，这意味着你应该创办一家新公司。

I define iterate as changing  the solution.

我将迭代定义为更改解决方案。

It turns out, you had the right customer, you had the right problem,  your MVP was shitty and it didn't work. We need a new solution.

事实证明，你有正确的客户，你有正确的问题，你的MVP是糟糕的，它没有工作。我们需要一个新的解决方案。

It turns  out maybe your MVP was great, but it didn't solve the problem. You need a  new solution.

结果可能你的MVP很棒，但没能解决问题。你需要一个新的解决方案。

It turns out you showed the product to your customers, and they didn't  want to use it, even though they have burning problems. We need a new solution.  Oftentimes I see this in reverse. People think solution first, and when the customers they  thought didn't like their product, they try to find some other random customer who does,  who might even have a completely different problem.

结果发现你把产品展示给你的客户，他们不想使用它，尽管他们有烧焦的问题。我们需要一个新的解决方案。我经常看到相反的情况。人们首先想到解决方案，当他们认为不喜欢他们的产品的客户时，他们试图找到其他随机的客户，他们甚至可能有一个完全不同的问题。

And they try shopping around their solution,  because they think their solution is the genius part.

他们试图围绕他们的解决方案购物，因为他们认为他们的解决方案是天才的一部分。

I think the problem is the  genius part.

我认为问题在于天才。

I think identifying a problem that other people haven't figured out is worth  working on is the genius part. Right? Facebook wasn't first at social networking, and Google  wasn't first at search engines.

我认为找出其他人还没有解决的问题是很有价值的。对吗？Facebook并不是社交网络领域的第一名，谷歌也不是搜索引擎领域的第一名。

Their genius was understanding that the people who came before  them hadn't solved the problem.

他们的天才在于认识到，先于他们的人并没有解决这个问题。

And if they could solve the problem better, they'd build  huge companies.

如果他们能更好地解决问题，他们就会建立大公司。

Their genius wasn't, "Oh, we built this cool thing. Let's just figure out  who might want to use it." Wrapping up a little bit here, I like to  tell a story about fake Steve Jobs versus real Steve Jobs.

他们的天才不是，“哦，我们造了这个很酷的东西。让我们找出谁会想要用它。”在这里总结一下，我喜欢讲述一个关于假史蒂夫·乔布斯和真实的史蒂夫·乔布斯的故事。

A lot of people  think that Steve Jobs is this person they should emulate, but they have a false  picture in their heads of what Steve Jobs was.

很多人认为史蒂夫·乔布斯是他们应该效仿的人，但在他们的脑海中，他们对史蒂夫·乔布斯是个错误的形象。

They think that he dreamed perfect  ideas out of his head and into the world.

他们认为他从脑子里想出了完美的想法，进入了世界。

And what's funny is that I  think oftentimes people look at the iPhone as a perfect example of this. But they  look at their iPhone today. Your iPhone today is fucking magical.

有趣的是，我认为人们经常把iPhone看作是一个完美的例子。但是他们今天看他们的iPhone。你今天的iPhone真他妈的神奇。

The first iPhone sucked  in almost every way.

第一部iPhone几乎在各个方面都很吸引人。

And they don't realize that Steve Jobs wasn't somebody who was  just not iterating, who just imagined near perfection minute one. Steve Jobs was iterating at  every step. So I like to remind people what the first iPhone did. First iPhone,  no 3G, back when 3G was a standard feature. So oh, you have this great  internet browser, but you can only use it on Edge, which means it fucking sucks,  right? One carrier. Oh, you don't have this carrier, sorry. Switch carriers. Figure that out.  Horrible battery life. Screen cracked all the time. No App Store. You can't even download  other apps.

他们没有意识到史蒂夫·乔布斯并不是一个不重复的人，他只是想象着几乎完美的一分钟。史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)在每一步都在迭代。所以我想提醒人们第一部iPhone做了什么。第一部iPhone没有3G，那时3G是一个标准功能。哦，你有一个很棒的网络浏览器，但是你只能在Edge上使用它，这意味着它他妈的糟透了，对吧？一艘航母。哦，你没有这个航母，抱歉。交换载波。想办法解决这个问题。可怕的电池寿命。屏幕一直都裂开。没有应用商店。你甚至不能下载其他的应用程序。

That was the first iPhone. Everyone forgets that iPhone. So if you are  the person in your company who is being fake Steve Jobs, is saying, "The product  has to be this way, because it's what I said, fuck the customers, fuck everyone  else, fuck you. Make the product the way I want it to be." You're being  fake Steve Jobs. Real Steve Jobs released a shitty MVP that was revolutionary, but still  fairly shitty, and every year iterated it, until you have that thing in your pocket  right now, which is pretty damn good. Real Steve Jobs iterates and talks to customers.  Fake Steve Jobs just dreams and creates art. Don't be fake Steve Jobs. Okay. So  with all of this, I want to go back to the beginning. What I said  in the beginning still holds. Justin.tv ...

那是第一部iPhone。每个人都忘了那部iPhone。所以如果你是公司里假冒史蒂夫·乔布斯的人，你就会说，“产品必须是这样的，因为我是这么说的，去他妈的顾客，去其他人，去你的。让产品按照我想要的样子做。”你在假装史蒂夫·乔布斯。真正的史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)发布了一款破烂的MVP，这是革命性的，但仍然相当糟糕，而且每年都会重复一遍，直到你现在口袋里有了那个东西，这真是太棒了。真正的史蒂夫·乔布斯(SteveJobs)反复与客户交谈。假史蒂夫乔布斯只是梦想和创造艺术。别假装史蒂夫·乔布斯。好的。所以，在这一切之后，我想回到起点。我一开始说的话仍然有效。Justin.tv.。

The only reason why I actually even know  any of these rules is because we broke all of them.

我之所以真正知道这些规则的唯一原因是因为我们违反了所有这些规则。

The one thing that  Justin.tv and Twitch had was a really strong technical team with high ego in the  product and low burn. When we started figuring things out with Twitch it was very  interesting. Gamers had been on our product the whole time. Gamers had been streaming on  Justin.tv since almost the beginning.

Justin.tv和Twitc拥有一支非常强大的技术团队，他们在产品中表现出很高的自尊心和较低的烧伤率。当我们开始和特维奇一起解决问题的时候，这是非常有趣的。游戏玩家一直在使用我们的产品。游戏玩家几乎从一开始就在Justin.tv上播放。

At any given time, they were 20% of our traffic  for years. We ignored them. We ignored them. We ignored them. We ignored them.

在任何时候，他们都是我们交通流量的20%，多年来。我们忽略了他们。我们忽略了他们。我们忽略了他们。我们忽略了他们。

They  still used the product. We didn't build features for them.

他们还在用这个产品。我们没有为他们建立功能。

They still used the product.  They must have been pretty fucking desperate, because they still used the product year after  year.

他们还在用这个产品。他们一定非常绝望，因为他们年复一年地使用这个产品。

The number one thing that changed when we started working on Twitch was we  started talking to them.

当我们开始研究Twitc时，最重要的改变是我们开始和他们交谈。

And what's weird was it's not like we were talking to  other users.

奇怪的是，我们并没有和其他用户交谈。

In the early days of Justin.tv we didn't talk to any users. We  had these crazy product development cycles. We couldn't do that with talking to users, too.  So what we did in the beginning was we literally just sat down with these  gamers and we said, "What did you want?" And what's funny is we didn't build  them anything very special.

在Justin.tv的早期，我们没有与任何用户交谈。我们有过疯狂的产品开发周期。我们也不能和用户交谈。我们刚开始做的就是和这些游戏玩家坐下来，然后我们说：“你想要什么？”有趣的是我们没有给他们做什么特别的东西。

They were like, "Oh, like lag sucks," and a couple ...  They wanted little things. What was great about them was they realized we were now  going to build something for them.

他们说，“哦，就像滞后太糟了，”还有几个.他们想要些小东西。最棒的是他们意识到我们现在要为他们建造一些东西。

And no one on the internet was building things  for these gamers.

而互联网上没有人为这些游戏玩家造东西。

And they realized that when we said we were going to build  something, it came out. When was the last time that you talked to someone building  a product that you like, and you said, "Can you do this?" and they did  it? When was the last time you suggested a feature to Mark at Facebook and  then the feature came out? Never! It's one of the magical things you can deliver  as a startup is you can talk to a passionate user and then you can  build what they want.

他们意识到，当我们说我们要建什么东西的时候，它就出来了。你最后一次和你喜欢的产品的开发人员交谈是什么时候，你说：“你能做到这一点吗？”他们就这么做了？你上一次向Facebook的Mark推荐一个功能是什么时候，然后这个功能出现了？绝不可能这是一个神奇的事情，你可以作为一个创业公司，是你可以与一个充满激情的用户，然后你可以建立他们想要的。

And then you can say, "Here it is." And they will  fall in love with you, even if those features are relatively mundane, because let's ...  Twitter, Twitch today, chat on the right, video no the left. Same product. What was  great about this process was by talking to them, they realized that we were on  their side, realized they were building something for them so they told their friends.

然后你可以说，“在这里”他们会爱上你，即使这些特征是相对平淡无奇的，因为让我们.推特，今天推特，在右边聊天，视频没有左边。同样的产品。这个过程最棒的地方是通过和他们交谈，他们意识到我们是站在他们一边的，意识到他们在为他们建造一些东西，于是他们告诉了他们的朋友们。

That  was the major change.

这是主要的改变。

If we didn't have technical team, if we weren't cheap, if  our ego wasn't involved, never would have gotten to that point.

如果我们没有技术团队，如果我们不是廉价的，如果我们的自我没有参与，就永远不会达到这个地步。

And if you look  at the history of Justin.tv, in the first five years, it went from being worth  nothing to being worth about $24,000,000.

如果你看看Justin.tv的历史，在最初的五年里，它从一无所有变成了价值2400万美元。

And the next three years it went from being  worth $24,000,000 to being worth a billion.

在接下来的三年里，它的价值从2400万美元变成了10亿美元。

That's what software can do when hit the  right customer. Let's do a couple questions.

这是软件可以做的，当击中正确的客户。我们来问几个问题。

In the back.
Speaker 3: So you mentioned that you should try to charge early [inaudible] discounts early, but if  you make or bought a product without having to make it afraid out and monetize  with some premium content, what should you do?
Michael Seibel: So the question is put it more generally. Should you be going free if your  final idea for a product is to be free? What I would say is this.  If your users are users who you never plan to charge, then it's totally fine  for you to be free. But if you do plan to charge them in some  way, it's really helpful to charge them as soon as possible, because you want to  know whether or not they're willing to pay.

在后面。演讲者3：所以你说过你应该尽早收取(听不见的)折扣，但是如果你制造或购买了一个产品，而不必让它害怕，然后用一些优质的内容来赚钱，你该怎么办？迈克尔·塞贝尔：所以问题是更笼统地提出来。如果你对一个产品的最终想法是免费的，你应该免费吗？我要说的是这个。如果你的用户是你从来不打算收费的用户，那么你完全可以免费。但如果你真的计划以某种方式向他们收费，尽快向他们收费是很有帮助的，因为你想知道他们是否愿意付钱。

And certainly if their business depends on  it, it's especially helpful to charge them. So that's the measure that I would use.  And they're all kinds of little tweaks and so and so forth, but at a  high level, do you ever plan to charge them? I'd charge them.

当然，如果他们的生意依赖于此，向他们收费尤其有帮助。所以这就是我要用的方法。他们是各种各样的小调整，等等，但在一个高水平，你有没有计划对他们收费？我会起诉他们。

If you never  plan to charge them, you can plan to monetize based on ads, which is really  usually the way you never plan to charge, is you monetize with ads.

如果你从来没有计划向他们收费，你可以计划通过广告赚钱，这通常是你从来不打算收费的方式，那就是你用广告赚钱。

If you're  not going to monetize with ads, you probably should start charging them.

如果你不打算用广告赚钱，你应该开始收费。

All right, next  question. Front.
Speaker 4: Thank you for sharing all this. You mentioned that the ...

好的下一个问题。前面演讲者4：谢谢你分享这一切。你说过.。

Almost always the best  revenue or the best cake adding cash is revenue.
Michael Seibel: Yep.
Speaker 4: Let's say I'm launched.

几乎总是最好的收入或最好的蛋糕增加现金是收入。迈克尔·塞贝尔：是的。演讲者4：假设我被发射了。

I'm early based and I'm trying to get that first sale.  I know for a few weeks it's going to be hard to get that to  go from zero to anything. Should I still be writing revenue down, or should I  try something-
Michael Seibel: Revenue.

我很早就开始做生意了，我正试着拿到第一笔生意。我知道在几个星期内，从零到任何东西都是很难的。我应该继续记下来收入，还是应该尝试一下-迈克尔·塞贝尔：收入。

If your metric ...

如果你的指标.。

If your KPI is metric. Yeah, yeah, yeah [inaudible] do  that.

如果你的KPI是公制的。是的，是的(听不到)。

If your KPI is revenue and the number is zero, should you still be  tracking that as your top line KPI? The short answer is yes. You should be  depressed looking at that number every week and to ...

如果你的KPI是收入，而这个数字是零，你应该继续跟踪它作为你的第一行KPI吗？简短的回答是肯定的。你应该每周看着这个数字沮丧然后.

That's the answer.

这就是答案。

I want  to be clear, like I said with Socialcam, right, there are contributing numbers to that,  right? And so whereas, DAUs was our top line metric, right? We also ...

我想说清楚，就像我说过的，对吧，这是有贡献的，对吧？因此，DAU是我们的最高指标，对吗？我们也.。

The  things we thought contributed to that: new content, new users, retained users, those numbers we  can move. So if you're in a sales type business, your KPI number one revenue,  if it's zero, that should fuck you in the face. Zero. Zero. Zero. Horrible. But  then you should ask yourself maybe your three other metrics are how many conversations did  we have this week? How many people are in contracting? How many people are in  onboarding? Right? And those can be your three numbers that will ...

我们所想的一切都促成了这一点：新的内容，新的用户，保留的用户，我们可以移动的数字。因此，如果你从事销售型业务，你的KPI第一收入，如果是零，这应该会让你的脸。零。零。零。太可怕了。但是你应该问问自己，也许你的另外三个指标是我们这周有多少次谈话？有多少人在订约？有多少人在登机？对吗？这些可以是你的三个数字.

If those numbers  move, you expect the revenue number to move.

如果这些数字移动，您预计收入号会移动。

And they can keep you motivated. But  your top line KPIs, no bullshit.

他们可以让你保持动力。但你的底线KPI别胡说八道。

Absolutely no bullshit. Okay.
Speaker 4: Thank you.
Speaker 5: We're a hardware company, pre-launch, and so our users, our target market, experience our problem  five to 900 times a day, and the intensity is can we pay our rent  or not? But we'd like to offer pre-sales as a way of getting the product  to market. Do you guys have any tips on doing that?
Michael Seibel: Do we have any tips on pre-sales? What I would say is that there are  many, many tips on pre-sales.

绝对不要胡说八道。好的。演讲者4：谢谢。演讲者5：我们是一家硬件公司，推出前，所以我们的用户，我们的目标市场，体验我们的问题五到九百次一天，强度是我们能支付我们的租金或不？但我们希望提供售前服务，作为产品推向市场的一种方式。你们对此有什么建议吗？迈克尔·塞贝尔：我们对售前有什么建议吗？我想说的是，在售前有很多窍门。

I would email some founders who've done it before.

我会给一些以前做过这件事的创始人发电子邮件。

That's  one of my best tip is to email them and ask them what they did.  The number one mistake I see with pre-sales is discounting.

这是我最好的建议之一，就是给他们发电子邮件，问他们做了什么。我在预售前看到的第一个错误是打折。

The number one mistake is  that basically, especially hardware founders, will misunderstand how much they need to charge, so they  don't lose money.

第一个错误是，基本上，特别是硬件创建者，他们会误解他们需要收取多少钱，这样他们就不会赔钱。

And so their presale becomes their death. So I'd avoid that.

所以他们的预售变成了他们的死亡。所以我会避免那样做。

All  right, two more quickly.

好吧，再快点。

In the way back.
Speaker 6: Okay, you mentioned having a slow burn. What was the hardest part of that? And  how did you-
Michael Seibel: What was the hardest part of having a slow burn. Well, we were young, so  it wasn't hard at all. We were living like we lived in dorms.

在回来的路上。演讲者6：好吧，你说过烧得很慢。其中最难的部分是什么？你是怎么做到的-迈克尔·塞贝尔：慢烧最难的部分是什么？嗯，我们那时还年轻，所以一点也不难。我们就像住在宿舍一样。

I think  it's a lot harder now, right, I've a kid, I've got a wife, got an  apartment, got a car.

我觉得现在更难了，对吧，我有了孩子，我有了妻子，有了公寓，有了车。

It'd be really hard now.

现在会很难的。

And so I think really the  hard part about slow burn is can you adjust your lifestyle if you've already leveled  it up? And if you haven't leveled up your lifestyle yet, and you're still working  ...

所以我认为慢速烧伤的困难之处在于，如果你已经调整了你的生活方式，你能调整它吗？如果你还没有改善你的生活方式，你还在工作.

If you're young and you're still working at a company that's paying you well,  not leveling up your lifestyle is a big way to stay ready to do a  startup.

如果你还年轻，你还在一家薪水很高的公司工作，不改变你的生活方式是你准备创业的一个重要方式。

Adding on the mortgages and the cars and the vacations makes it a lot  harder.

加上抵押贷款、汽车和假期，这会让事情变得更加困难。

I just know a lot of people how never could come back from that.  Absolutely never.

我只知道很多人怎么可能永远也不会回来。绝对不会。

In the back.
Speaker 7: Yeah, can you talk a little bit about going from beta to early MVP when  you know you're sort of there?
Michael Seibel: How do you go from beta to early MVP? I don't really know what those  distinctions are.

在后面。演讲者7：是的，当你知道你在那里的时候，你能谈谈从测试到早期的MVP吗？迈克尔·塞贝尔：你是如何从贝塔到早期的MVP的？我真的不知道这些区别是什么。

All I know is are people using your product? Yes. No.

我只知道有人在用你的产品？是否

If people  are not using your product, get to the point where people are using your product  extremely quickly. Once people are using your product, there's all different labels for it, beta,  pre-launch, alpha, blah, blah, blah, who cares. Right? It's just that's the dividing line. Like  are people using your product? The next question is are you actually solving their problem?  That's the next question, not are we following this line of launching things? Most YC  companies will launch many, many, many times. So that progression isn't really that important.

如果人们没有使用你的产品，那就达到人们使用你产品的速度非常快的程度。一旦人们开始使用你的产品，就会有各种各样的标签，测试版，预发布版，alpha，诸如此类，谁在乎呢。对吗？只是这是分界线。就像人们在用你的产品吗？下一个问题是你真的解决了他们的问题吗？这是下一个问题，难道我们不遵循这条启动的路线吗？大多数YC公司都会推出很多次。所以这种进展并不是很重要。

Are  people using your product?
Speaker 7: Yeah, they are.
Michael Seibel: Great. Bam. You're launched. Congratulations. Call it whatever you want.

有人在用你的产品吗？演讲者7：是的，他们是。迈克尔·塞贝尔：太好了。砰的一声。你被发射了。祝贺你!你想叫什么就叫什么。

All right, one more.
Speaker 8: Here you go.
Speaker 9: Yeah.

好吧，再来一次。演讲者8：给你。演讲者9：是的。

I have a question regarding how to select [inaudible] . You already mentioned an  app that we should follow the metrics, but I think that we have a pool  of two or three [inaudible] , but each one wants something different. What will it  be [inaudible] which one will in fact [inaudible] ?
Michael Seibel: This is a great question.

我有一个关于如何选择[听不见]的问题。您已经提到了一个应用程序，我们应该遵循度量标准，但我认为我们有两个或三个(听不见的)池，但是每个程序都想要一些不同的东西。它将是什么[听不见的]哪一个人将实际上[听不到]？迈克尔·塞贝尔：这是一个很好的问题。

And I'll have an unsatisfying answer.

我会得到一个不满意的答案。

The question is basically  how do we figure out what to build next? Here's my answer.

问题基本上是我们如何确定下一步要建什么？这是我的答案。

The reason why  you have a product development cycle is so that you can work on multiple things.  Usually there isn't a right answer. Usually all of the things that you want to  build won't work. So what you need to do is you need to create a  process in your company to build things quickly, so that you can actually see whether  they'll work or not, and then you can iterate them from there. So it's far  more important to have a technically talented team that can build MVPs quickly in a  non-frustrating way, and then measure the results, then it is to be a super genius  who can imagine what's going to happen in the future without actually knowing. Now, in  the big picture you have to have that imagination. For your vision for where it's  going to be 10 years from now, you have to have that imagination. For the  little technical, tactical move in the next three months, it's really hard to nail those.  If you have a process that can rip out things quickly, and then only iterate  the things that are working, that'll serve you far better. Our mistake was that at  Justin.tv.

您之所以有一个产品开发周期，是因为您可以在多个方面进行工作。通常没有正确的答案。通常，你想要构建的所有东西都不能工作。所以你需要做的是你需要在你的公司中创建一个过程来快速地构建东西，这样你就可以真正地看到它们是否能工作，然后你可以在那里迭代它们。所以，更重要的是拥有一支技术精湛的团队，能够以一种不让人沮丧的方式快速建立MVP，然后衡量结果，然后是一个超级天才，能够想象未来会发生什么，而不需要实际知道。现在，从总体上看，你必须要有这样的想象力。对于你10年后的愿景，你必须要有那样的想象力。在接下来的三个月里，在技术上和战术上的小动作，都是很难做到的。如果你有一个过程可以快速地撕开东西，然后只迭代正在工作的东西，那将为你提供更好的服务。我们的错误是在Justin.tv。

It was thinking every time we've got the home run. Let's only swing for  home runs.

每次我们有本垒打的时候都在想。我们只打全垒打。

And of course, it would take three months to do it, because we've  got to make it perfect, right? And then the whole spiral of death.

当然，这需要三个月的时间，因为我们必须让它变得完美，对吗？然后是死亡的螺旋。

All right,  the last I'll say is my email address is mmichael@ycombinator.com. Strangely I tell people that  I answer every email, and people mostly don't believe me.

好的，最后我要说的是我的电子邮件地址是mmichael@y合ator.com。奇怪的是，我告诉人们，我回复每一封电子邮件，人们大多不相信我。

And the ones who do,  email me, and I reply.

有的人发邮件给我，然后我回复。

And so everyone I talk to, and everyone online, there's  really only two categories of people, the people who don't believe me, in which case  great, continue your lives, and the people who will believe me, and if you need  help, they'll email, and I will try to help you the best I can.

所以和我交谈的每个人，和网上的每个人，只有两类人，不相信我的人，在这种情况下，伟大的人，继续你的生活，和那些相信我的人，如果你需要帮助，他们会发电子邮件，我会尽我所能帮助你。

It's  really that simple. You don't need to have networked with me. Y Combinator is fairly  easy to spell and so is Michael, so you should be able to figure that  out.

就这么简单。你不需要和我联网。YCombinator很容易拼写，Michael也很容易拼写，所以您应该能够理解这一点。

Thank you.


谢谢。
