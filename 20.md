# Fundraising Fundamentals By Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: We're gonna have two lectures on fundraising. This one, which is going to be a  high level overview, which I'll do. Then next week, my partner Kirstie, will do a  deep dive into the mechanics of fundraising which are really fun, so you wouldn't wanna  miss that. Before I start, I will say we have an amazing set of resources  in our library on fundraising. You should look at them. You should read Paul Graham's  essays on fundraising. They have aged really well and they will help you a lot.  I wrote a guide to seed fundraising as well that I think is pretty useful,  but there are lots of other resources. Videos from last year's start up school, from  2014, How to Start Up a Start Up. One of which I'll reference later which  will be massively helpful when you go out and raise money in early rounds and  in later rounds. Start ups are hard. Fundraising can be one of the hardest parts  even though fun is right in the word. It's really not that fun. It's a  weird marketplace when you get out there. It seems like kind of an open market,  but it's not rational. It's seldom fair. Yeah, you will hear of founders who tell  you "Ah, fundraising was easy. I started walking down Sandhill Road and people showered me  with cash." That's the exception rather than the rule. While you're fundraising, you're going to  hear "no" a lot, most of you. You will hear reasons why your start up  will not succeed, why your product is not a good one, why the opportunity you're  talking about is not real. Sometimes they'll be right, too, but you should never believe  that because you will survive. The way you will survive the multiple times you're gonna  go fundraise is by being tough and resilient, and above all, by believing. No matter  what you hear, no matter how many times you hear "no" or reasons why your  start up won't succeed, you need to believe. I promised I'd go fast, but I'm  gonna go so fast ... I'm gonna give you a complete overview of everything you  need to know about fundraising in about a minute or less. Then I'll go deeper  after that. Anyone who wants to leave after this minute, because you got everything that  you needed, I won't feel bad. Just walk out. Okay? So, in less than a  minute. Figure out the story of your start up. This means figure out why you're  going to matter in the future. What is it about your product, your opportunity that's  gonna tell a story about the future, that a venture capitalist would care about? This  might mean getting product market fit. It might mean growth. It could mean a lot  of things. Then find the right investors. Do research. Talk to other founders. This is  where organizations like YC can be a ton of help. Get organized. You do your  homework, you create your spreadsheet, and you get a list of everyone you're going to  talk to and you're going to reach out to, or you're going to get introductions  to. Then you begin. You will pitch again and again and again. You will refine  your story again and again and you will get better at it as you iterate.  Eventually, you'll meet the right investors. Sometimes the right investors will be the investor with  whom you resonate the best and who you think is gonna be the best added  value. Sometimes the right investor will be the person who is willing to write you  a check first. Then you agree on a price. We'll talk about negotiations more later.  Then you get the money in the bank. Lastly, you get back to work. That's  it. Simple, right? I think that was less than a minute. Now you can leave.  Okay, so let's get a little perspective first. Why does VC even exist? Well, there's  a market for it, right? You guys need the money, most of you. Most of  you want the money. There's sort of another reason, too, which is the returns can  be really big. It wasn't always that way. Many people tracked the beginning of Silicon  Valley to Bill and Dave starting Hewlett-Packard around 1957. They started with $583 of their  own money and never raised venture. It's possible to do that, but it turns out  to do a high growth start up you usually do need money. About the same  time, this French guy named Georges Doriot kind of kicked off the whole thing by  investing $70,000 in this, what was to become epic company, Digital Equipment Corporation. He turned  that $70,000 into $35,000,000 which as you might imagine, got some people interested. That kicked  off an entire industry. But why raise money? What do you need it for? Well,  you need it to pay for stuff, to hire people, to rent offices. You need  it to grow, right? Start up equals growth as Paul Graham wrote a long time  ago. To grow, you almost always need start up capital. It's possible to bootstrap. Some  companies do, but it is really hard. You should keep in mind it's also true  that having money can be a competitive advantage, so most start ups, most of the  time, will raise money. When should you raise money? Now the obvious answer is when  you need it. That's when you're gonna raise money, when you need the money. Unfortunately,  it's actually the opposite that's true. The best time to raise money is when you  don't need it. This isn't always possible, but when you don't need money, investors see  the biggest opportunity. So throughout the lifetime of your start up, if you can arrange  to be in a position where you have lots of money and lots of prospects,  the money will come flowing in. If you're profitable, it helps a lot. If you're  desperate, VCs can smell that a mile away. How much should you raise? One rule  of thumb ... And I'll give you another one in a second. One thought process  to go through is assume when you raise money that this is the last time  you'll ever be able to raise, so raise enough so you won't need more, so  you can get to profitability. Now obviously this is not always possible. It depends on  the kind of start up you have. You should at least know what you're gonna  spend the money on, so do some math. Figure out what the average employee is  going to cost. An engineer, for example, might be $15,000. We usually use a rule  of thumb that a seed run of about 18 months, whatever time frame that you  need to where you can raise more money. You have to hit milestones that will  be persuasive then, or you have to get to profitability, and then the number of  folks you're gonna hire. So, how to raise. There could be a whole lecture on  this. Rather than doing a whole lecture, I'm just gonna make a couple of points  on this. First, what you know. Investors invest in you. So ask yourself, if you  were an investor, would you invest in you? Are you formidable enough? Are you the  kind of person who can take an idea and turn it into a reality that  matters, into a big company? Yeah, I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm gonna go  into a little more detail and I'm gonna repeat a little bit of what I  said in that very first lecture. The other thing that investors are going to invest  in is the story of your start up. What product are you building for what  opportunity, for what customers? Is this story interesting, believable? Does it resonate? Does it tell  a future that they can believe in? Think about that. It has to tell a  future about a company that you guys are building that has hundreds of thousands of  employees. Like those CTOs you saw sitting up here. At one point, they were exactly  where you are, with nothing. Now they have tens of millions or more in revenue,  hundreds of employees. Can the investor you're talking to believe that about what you're going  to build? What components of the story are there? It has to represent a large  opportunity. By the way, if that's confusing, why do you need a large opportunity? Google  venture math and understand what the venture capitalist cares about. What sort of returns they  need to make things worthwhile. Is there a compelling product attraction and is the storyteller  impressive? What if you don't have these things? You're telling a story. A story is  more persuasive if you actually have product in traction, but it doesn't mean you can't  raise money just with a good story. Look at Magic Leap. If you've heard of  Magic Leap, they've raised billions on just a story. It's the story that matters. Everything  else is just how persuasive you are. Sure, if you have millions of users and  growing like crazy, that's pretty persuasive. That's the easy case. Interestingly, the very best investors  wanna get you before you have all that stuff because you're expensive by then. The  greatest, best investors are Airbnb before they were Airbnb, before they have traction. So remember,  to build your story, I went through this earlier, spend time on this. Build the  vertebrae. Define the vertebrae of your story, the key points that are the most memorable,  most important. Build a story, a pitch, a sales pitch, around that. Remember everything you're  doing as a founder is being a salesperson. You're selling to investors here, or to  yourself to get up in the morning after you've heard "no' 25 times in a  row, to your partners, to your customers. What valuation should you choose? This again you  could do a whole lecture on. It's complicated what valuation you should choose. It's somewhat  of a market, but it's a very strange market. I would really recommend you look  at the video of Sam Altman talking to Ron Conway, Marc Andreessen, Parker Conrad from  Zenefits at the time Ripley Now when they talk about what valuation you should choose.  Around the 22nd or 23rd minute, Parker starts talking about his experience raising money. It  is really dangerous to choose too high a valuation. In fact, it can kill your  fundraising because it's quite difficult to go to an investor who might kind of be  interested, and you say, "I'm gonna raise a $12,000,000 cap on my SAFE." They're like,  "I was gonna invest, but that's really expensive." Then to go back to them and  say, "Actually we're a lot cheaper." "You're cheaper? You mean you're not as good? No,  I'm not interested in investing." I have seen companies actually fail fundraising because they chose  too high evaluation. You don't wanna choose too low evaluation either because you can overdo  the dilution. We'll talk about dilution in a second. The most important thing is to  get the money in the bank and get back to work. That's why we talk  a lot ... You'll see it again and again ... About not over-optimizing fundraising. As  I mentioned, Kirstie's gonna go over the mechanics of raising money in detail later, so  I'm gonna go very quickly here about the mechanics of raising convertibles or equity very  briefly. Oh, and yes, I'll mention ICOs. There are other ways of raising money nowadays  that have little to do with equity. There's also debt of various kinds, but we're  gonna talk more about this. A convertible note is a kind of debt as well,  although we don't recommend you use convertible notes anymore. Convertibles are strange. It is strange.  You go to an investor and say, "Do you believe in the future of my  company? Would you like to buy a piece of it?" And they say, "Yes. I  wanna buy a piece of your company." You say, "Okay, not really. I'm gonna sell  you a promise of a piece of my company." , which is what a convertible  is. It's not actually equity in your company. It represents equity and it represents dilution,  it's just not actually dilution right at the time. The great thing ... So why  does this even exist? Why do investors agree to this? Well, because partly YC demanded  that they agree to it. Partly because it's really good for companies. It's fast and  simple. The average document here is three to five pages. When you do equity, it  will be three or four documents representing hundreds of pages, lots of legalese. You don't  need a lawyer for this. It's super cheap. It can cost hundreds of dollars or  less. You can do it almost automatically using tools like Clerky. Still read the fine  print. You should read every fundraising document you ever have to deal with, every last  word. You really need to. There are many, many stories of nightmares of people agreeing  to things they didn't know they were agreeing to. Equity, when you actually issue new  shares to a shareholder, is slow, almost always expensive. You almost always need lawyers. You're  gonna be giving those investors rights that you don't have to give when you do  a convertible. Those rights are important and important to understand. They're usually called preferred provisions.  So again, read everything. I'm sure you guys all understand dilution. Dilution's dead simple, right?  You're a shareholder in your company. If you sell 20 percent of your company, you  now own 20 percent less. If you raise $1,000,000 on a $4,000,000 post valuation, post-money  valuation, you've just sold 20 percent of your company, 1,000,000 over five, 20 percent. If  you owned 50 percent of your company ... Everyone with me? ... You've just sold  10 percent of that 50 percent, 20 percent times 50 percent. Now you own 40  percent. That's dilution. Simple, right? Convertibles actually made that complicated to figure out because you  actually haven't sold yet. So there's a representative dilution, but not an actual dilution. As  it turns out, when you do a pre-money convertible, the actual dilution that you're selling  is difficult to know. It depends on how much extra money, how much other money,  you raise besides on that convertible. If you raise lots of money on lots of  different convertible notes understanding the actual dilution is complicated. I actually wrote a tool called  Angelcalc that helps you figure it out. It's more complicated than I'm actually letting on  because how you calculate the price that you actually get when you convert includes things  you might not expect, like future option pools for pre-money SAFEs. We've changed that and  now the standard YC document that Kirstie will go into more detail, is a post-money  SAFE. A post-money SAFE is dead simple, mostly. It's dead simple in that if you  invest $1,000,000 on that $4,000,000 post-money SAFE, you own 25 percent. You can be pretty  sure that at that moment in time, you're really buying about 25 percent. So it's  good for investors because they understand. It's equally good for founders because you guys understand.  You guys have a good feeling for what your cap table looks like. I'm gonna  go through this pretty quickly. You guys probably know all this. There's angels and VCs.  Angels are usually wealthy people that invest their own money. They usually invest for similar  reasons to VCs, but they also invest because they're passionate about things. So, different sort  of conversation when you're talking to someone who's gonna invest their own money and how  they close and what their decision process is than a VC. Sorry. Than a VC  who is a professional investing someone else's money, limited partners. They have a very different  approach, different process for closing. There's also other ways of raising. I'm not gonna spend  a lot of time. There's Kickstarter, there's AngelList, there's Wefunder. There's all sorts of crowdfunding  mechanisms out there now that usually don't play the major role in your fundraising, but  often will play an ancillary role. They might help you fill out a round or  fill out the amount of money that you're trying to raise. All right, everyone's heard  of an ICO, right? An initial coin offering. I had a conversation earlier in the  class with Andy Bromberg, the president of CoinList, which helps companies do ICOs. The vast  majority of you probably wanna do an ICO, but shouldn't. ICOs are complicated. You need  usually a certain kind of network for which having a cryptocurrency is a smart thing  to do. You have to know SCC regulations backwards and forwards. It's a moving target.  Even though there's big dollars associated with it, you should approach this whole topic with  a lot of caution and educate yourself a ton. Just again, part of the ecosystem.  Usually, we talk in terms of rounds. There's a lot of fuzziness in this now,  but usually you might start your company by putting money on a credit card. Then  you might get some friends and family money. Usually, this is sort of debt. You  don't usually give out equity here, but sometimes you will. Then you raise a seed  round. We don't recommend you do equity in a seed round. Usually it'll be on  some sort of convertible. Then you get into your equity rounds. Bigger rounds. Usually this  is smaller amounts of money to great amounts of money. You can do a Series  A, B, C, D. I've seen Series F. Then eventually, if things go well and  you don't get acquired, which could be things going well, you can do an IPO.  Let's talk a little bit about meeting investors. I know I'm repeating myself here, but  it bears repeating. If you want to meet investors, do your homework. Know what they've  invested in. Know what the particular person you're talking about cares about. If you don't,  you're at a disadvantage immediately or you're certainly not putting yourself in the advantageous position  that you can. Simplify your pitch. Work on this all the time. You wanna capture  their attention in the first minute or two you're talking to them. I know this  is a hard thing to say, but don't be boring. I say it's a hard  thing to say because you guys all probably think that what you're working on is  the most fascinating thing in the world, but it might not be fascinating the way  you tell it. You might tell it backwards. You might come at it from the  wrong way, which like every detail is fascinating to you, but you need to capture  someone's attention. You need to build a story that's compelling from the beginning. The simplest  way to tell your story is usually the best way to tell it. If you  can, bring a demo. If you can't, fake it. Bring a prototype. It's so fast,  especially if you have a software product, it's so fast to build things. Even if  you're building hardware, bring a prototype of your hardware. Steve Jobs used to demand prototypes  in wood. The first tablet, the first iPad, was in wood. Anything to get a  feel for what it's going to be. Also remember, you're trying to convince the investor  that you can actually build what you're talking about, so coming completely empty handed, well,  you better be a really good storyteller, if you come empty handed. Often forgotten, is  that you should listen. You're not there to monologue. You're there to have a conversation,  to listen to what they have to say in terms of feedback. It can be  incredibly useful even if they say no. Also, the good sign that an investor meeting  is going well is when they talk at least as much or more than you  do. When you're pitching investors, you will suck in the beginning. One of the marks  of a successful fundraiser is they get better and better every meeting they have. So,  yes, you should practice. Probably the first investor meetings you have, it's not necessarily your  highest target investors unless you're positive you have it nailed. If any of you are  golfers, you know that you can hit a lot of golf swings and never improve  unless you get feedback and take in that feedback. It's the same thing with pitching.  Pay attention to what happens. Pay attention to how interested they are. Pay attention to  how the meeting went and what the feedback was and improve every time. Do not  leave an investor meeting without some sort of conclusion. Now the best conclusion is a  check or an agreement for a check. We have something called a handshake protocol that  you can look up as well. Getting a handshake for a deal, getting someone to  agree to give you money, that's awesome. If you don't get that, try to understand  whether it's a firm 'no' or whether there's next steps so that you can work  towards getting that. For most VCs, including angels, there's a process. Most people won't give  you money on the first meeting. Some will, but most won't. For raising seed, I  think decks are not that useful. As an angel investor myself, I almost never even  look at the deck. I just wanna look at the founder and here their story  and see how they tell it. Many of you won't be comfortable telling it without  a deck and some investors actually want a deck. They're more comfortable, too. So you  should probably have some short pitch deck. In A Guide to Seed Fundraising, I outlined  the 12 items that are important to have in such a deck. Don't create a  story around the deck, create a story around your story, and your product, and your  future. Figure out how to tell it without a deck because if you can't, well,  you can, right? So you're going to be able to. A word on negotiations, a  very brief word. First, I hope you don't have to. Hopefully, you'll meet an investor,  you'll tell your story. "We're building this awesome product. We have this traction. It's great.  We're raising $1,500,000 on an $8,000,000 cap." And they say, "I'm in for $100,000." Done.  No negotiation. No problem. Usually the most likely thing you might negotiate around is that  cap. Sometimes it's okay to state firmly what it is. Sometimes, if it's too high,  they might negotiate down. If you're not sure really what you're raising on, you haven't  raised any money on, you're just talking to investors, it's okay to start talking to  them about what they think is reasonable and try to zero in on what the  right number is. If you do enter into negotiations, just a few things to keep  in mind. What do I mean by empathy? Understand what they care about. Investors are  different, each one. If you're talking to an angel, they don't wanna seem like an  idiot. If you're talking a venture capitalist, they want to own a certain percentage of  your company. There's this trade off between how much money they put in and how  high the valuation is. Understand the person you're negotiating with. If you don't, you're probability  of getting it right and optimizing your negotiation is pretty low. Try to have options.  If I'm negotiating with you and I'm an investor and I'm the only person there  putting in money, I'm in a pretty strong position vis-a-vis you. Sometimes you'll be in  that position. That's okay as long as you get the money. This is what they  do. They're almost certainly better than you at negotiation. So if you do get into  a negotiation, a deep negotiation, the one thing you have on your side is you  can delay. You can say, "I don't know, I need to talk to my co-founder,  or my mother, or someone." Don't try to go toe to toe with the pros  in negotiating, especially with the VCs, because that's what they do. And I've said this  a few times, read everything. Okay, coming to the end here. What's gonna go wrong?  I've mentioned over-optimizing. This merely means that the most important thing that you guys can  do is build great products that customers love. That has little to do with fundraising,  except as an enabler of that. Trying to get the last dime out of fundraising  is taking away from that. It's usually counterproductive. Now there are fundraising ninjas, people who  can do anything. You look at them and say they raised $40,000,000 valuation, it was  incredible. Again, it was like people were showering them with money. You should not use  them, most of you, as your model. Figure out who the right investors are. Meet  lots of them and then get a deal done. Please don't be a bad actor.  Don't break deals. Be responsive. Don't be a jerk. It is a really small community  and that stuff gets around. This might not be the last start up you do.  Even if you've raised 90 percent of what you wanna raise, it's not likely to  be the last time you're gonna raise. Oh, and when you get your money ...  and this happened. Don't go to Vegas and gamble it. Think about ... This is  a weird thing ... For a second. Think about what you're asking investors to do,  especially when you're raising a seed round. You're asking them to write a check, a  lot of money, to you that you're gonna have control of that money based on  a promise of something in the future. That's it. There's a lot of trust built  in there. Which is why, by the way, you shouldn't exaggerate or pretend to know  things you don't know. Who's gonna trust someone who's not being quite frank, who I  don't get that feeling for, with that kind of ... You know, "Here's the money.  See you in a couple years." This is what they do, by the way. If  you think you can get away with something here, you usually won't. If there's one  thing ... VCs aren't all brilliant, they're not all actually all that good at being  a VC. What they are good at is sniffing this stuff out, so don't try.  It's actually not a good way to go through life anyway. Tell it straight. Tell  your story straight. Don't bullshit. There's very little win. Now there are people, we know  of them, we can name names, who are masters of bullshit, and it seems to  work. Don't try to be those people. When you get a "no", which you will  get, almost all of you, don't take it personally. They're probably right. Anyway, all you're  saying is that their vision of the future is different than your vision of the  future. It's really hard to have an accurate crystal ball. I think you'll all agree  with that. So don't take it personally, except maybe internalize that you didn't do a  good enough job in telling your story of the future. Take this one in. Fundraising  is not the goal. You go and you raise $2,000,000 in your seed round and  you high five everyone and it's great and you have gotten to the starting line.  You're building a business. You're building a product that people want. You're trying to build  something that's sustainable over the long term. Fundraising is just one small step on the  way to that. By the way, that's another reason not to be competitive about it.  Dropbox raised their first round at like a two or three million dollar valuation. It  worked out okay for Drew and team, right? They went IPO this year. Fundraising's not  winning. A company that raises the most at the highest valuation will not necessarily, or  even usually, be the biggest, most successful company at the end of the day. Investors  actually do matter. At some point, especially at seed, you need the money, but the  better you can do at choosing your investors wisely, investors who will make great connections  for you, who will help you build your product, and who won't be a pain  later, the happier you'll be. You'll hear this again and again. You'll hear Ron say  it several times if you look at that video I mentioned. The important thing, the  most important thing about fundraising is to get it done and get back to work,  get back to the real work on the real goal which is building your great  company. Good luck. I'm done. I'll take some questions. Yeah.

Speaker 2: I appreciate your thoughts [inaudible] What advice would you give me for fundraising [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: The question is, about if you're an international entities in London, what advice would I  give to fundraise? That's always a tough one, because it kind of depends. Built into  that question, should I become a US entity, et cetera. Most US based, exclusively US  based venture capitalists will not invest in an overseas entity. Or they'll do it with  a lot of hesitation, so it's certainly ... We require that everyone become a Delaware  corporation at YC. It's pretty cheap and easy to do. So if you do intend  to raise in Silicon Valley or elsewhere in the States, I strongly recommend you do  create a US entity. If you're building your business in London or in the UK  or overseas, there is a venture community there. A lot of times, they'll understand your  business better than a US market, so you have to make that trade off as  you figure out what the right target investors are. It's a complex equation and it's  a little hard to answer in too much detail in this context. Sure, yeah.

Speaker 3: What's typical for [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: The question is, look for investment and then incorporate or incorporate ... Incorporation, you can  do an incorporation using Atlas, if you're international from Stripe sort of instantly. I think  that's the wrong way to think about it. If you're gonna fundraise, you should incorporate  because a lot of you'll be LLCs or you are not even LLC yet. People  won't invest in that stuff. Incorporate so that's not a barrier, so you don't have  to say, "Oh, yeah, we're doing this and we're LLC." It just doesn't seem right.  Incorporation is dead simple now, so I would incorporate. Yes. In the back there.

Speaker 4: You mentioned two possibilities [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: The question is, when is equity preferable to convertible? There are companies that raise up  to $30,000,000 on convertibles. Convertibles are fast and simple, so when fast and simple is  your priority, convertibles are great. From an investor perspective, equity is often preferable because, like  I said, you're just buying this promise and you have no rights. Usually, when you  raise larger amounts of money, equity works better all around because there's a little more  fiduciary management. If you raise five to 10 million dollars, you tend to form a  board. You have people you have to talk to about how you're spending that money.  Hopefully, they're experienced and can help you through a lot of the issues that you'll  run into because they've seen it a lot of times. Generally, when you're raising seed  and you wanna go fast, and you're just building and trying to get product market  fit, and you don't have time, and you don't wanna spend $25,000 with lawyers, convertibles.  But when you're raising a huge amount and the company's getting serious, usually equity is  preferable all around.

Speaker 5: Yeah, so on one of the slides you talk about exaggeration. Do not exaggerate. I  was trying to understand how do we draw a line between not exaggerating but still  sharing our vision. If you're talking about the future of the company, so ...

Geoff Ralston: It's actually a good question. One of my slides said, "Don't exaggerate." The question is,  but what about your vision? A vision by definition is an exaggeration. I wouldn't even  look at it that way. Don't exaggerate the facts on the ground. Don't try to  hide something that's a problem by either lying about or obscuring the data. However, when  you're telling your story about how you're gonna take over the world, tell your story.  Take over the world. The caveat there is don't tell something stupid. Don't tell a  story that beggars belief. Remember, in the end, it has to be believable. So tell  a story that is credible, yet impressive. Yeah.

Speaker 6: If you've saved up money from consolidating [inaudible] or whatever to fund doing a start  up, what's the right way to put it in when it's your money but it's  ... Most of it is seed round funding?

Geoff Ralston: The question is, if you're putting your own money into the company, what's the right  way to do that? I'm not a lawyer, or an accountant, so you might wanna  ... If you're here, save that question for Kirstie. Generally, I will say that you  should just buy equity in your company. There's a lot of ways to do that.  You can do a convertible. You can just buy the equity. Probably in the beginning,  especially because you don't need a lawyer to negotiate with yourself. If you do, that's  a separate issue. You can probably just buy the stock in the company at the  right price and just ... You might wanna get a little legal advice to get  that right, or at least do your research, but-

Speaker 6: Like doing a SAFE or something yourself, that's not [crosstalk]

Geoff Ralston: I've seen people do that. It works.

Speaker 6: I was wondering how you do it.

Geoff Ralston: How you do it is you just write the SAFE and give yourself the money.  That's the thing about this. You guys are managing the money. You literally, when you  do a SAFE, you write this thing, you sign it, you give them your bank  account, and they wire you the money. Then you spend it, but you spend it  keeping in mind that you are now a fiduciary for that money. You have responsibilities.  That's just not your money, it's the company's money. Yeah.

Speaker 7: I know that [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: You said YC invests on a SAFE. That's true, but what's your question?

Speaker 7: I thought YC [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Actually in the future, our investment's gonna be entirely on a post-money SAFE.

Speaker 7: Post-money SAFE. Okay. Thank you.

Geoff Ralston: We just announced our new deal and that's what we announced. $150,000 for seven percent  on a post-money SAFE. Yeah.

Speaker 8: What's the definition of traction for a pre-SAFE start up? Everyone talks about traction, but  there's no definition for it.

Geoff Ralston: The question is, what's the definition of traction, indeed for a presale start up. If  no one's using your product, you have no traction. The definition of traction is usage  of some kind. It can be any kind of usage. It can be free usage  or it can be paid customers. Now you might ask a better question, which is  what's the definition of good traction? The answer is unfortunately, it depends. Usually, the one  thing to look at with traction is growth. How fast are you growing? Because you  can go to a VC and say, "I have $1,000,000 in sales." That might sound  really good. $1,000,000 in annual recurring revenue. If five years ago, you had $1,000,000 in  annual recurring revenue and now you still have $1,000,000 in revenue, they would much rather  see someone with $100,000 in revenue that grew that over the past month. So growth.  Yeah.

Speaker 9: I guess two questions. The first one is-

Geoff Ralston: One question at a time, please. Ask the most important one.

Speaker 9: Other than referrals from other people you know are sort of founders or other investors,  what would you recommend are best practices to connect with investors, other than just cold  email or something?

Geoff Ralston: The question is, what are the best practices for connecting with investors. I think you  said other a lot of the things I'm gonna say, but I'm gonna say them  anyway. Clearly, the best way to connect with an investor is via someone who knows  that investor. The absolute ultimate best way to connect with an investor is via an  investor who invests in your company who will connect you to another investor. That is  the best possible introduction. In fact, it's a pretty bad introduction to have an investor  introduce you to someone if they passed on your company. Think about it. It doesn't  really scan very well. The other way I'd say is find other founders who have  investors and get them to introduce you. Other than that, yeah, you have to cold  email, but that's what they do. They look for cold emails. You have to pound  the pavement. There's no way of escaping that. Yeah?

Speaker 10: [inaudible] funding for building out our product. Along those lines, I'm wondering if certain money  needs to be allocated to our developers and some other staff that may be required.  Do you itemize that when you're raising seed money?

Geoff Ralston: I think the question is, how do you explain the use of funds when you  raise your seed? I don't think there's any formula for that. I wouldn't get into  the weeds too much. If you're gonna raise $1,000,000, you say, "Look, with $1,000,000, we  get here. We achieve this milestone. We get to this level of revenue. The way  we're going to do that is by hiring three engineers, two salespersons, and three support  people. That staff is going to cost us this much money. That's why we're raising  this much money." Yeah.

Speaker 11: The new post-money SAFE, it seems like if you use that in, let's say the  pre-seed stage, or even seed stage, it could cause problems for [inaudible] seed, maybe like  a post-seed or something [inaudible] would force you to a price [inaudible] Has that been  a problem if, especially-

Geoff Ralston: The question is, is there an unintended consequence of the post-money SAFE that it will  force founders to do an equity round sooner because the definition of a post-money SAFE  is that future convertibles also get diluted by that post-money SAFE because it's post-money and  it is what it is? The answer is no, we haven't seen that because we  just launched it. I don't think that's that likely. Here's the reason. The nice thing  about a post-money SAFE is it's clear. It's not ambiguous. You know what percentage that  was sold. If they have a percent of the company, they have a percent. By  the way, if you do a post-money SAFE after ... If I invest $50,000 at  a $5,000,000, I have a percent. If later, you invest $100,000 at a $10,000,000 SAFE  after me, and it's a post-money SAFE, you own one percent. It's clear, so I  suspect that your concern will not become reality. Yes.

Speaker 12: Financials. Five year projections. Just from-

Geoff Ralston: What sort of financial projections should you have? If you run into an investor who's  asking for five year projections at seed, you've run into what we colloquially, call a  newb. They don't know what they're ... Who has five year projections at this point?  In fact, if you can tell what you're gonna do about for 12 or 18  months, that's great. When you raise future rounds, Series A's and B's, you're going to  start to say like okay, so you have 12 months of revenue or two years  of revenue experience. What are the next two or three years look like? You'll be  wrong, but at least you can do that. Now you're just so guaranteed to have  error bars that are 50 or 100 percent, why bother?. I would actually de-prioritize any  investor who asked for that sort of revenue projection. Yeah.

Speaker 13: How effective ... If you're doing a B2B pitch, how effective are customer testimonials? If  you got into the [inaudible] and replicated the process the business would have, how effective  is that feedback to an investor? So you've demonstrated attraction and demand-

Geoff Ralston: The question is, how effective are customer testimonials? I would generally say, not very. One  of the most common slides we get rid of in demo day is "Our customers  love us." That's great, but do they pay you? If they love you enough to  pay you, that's interesting. If they just love you, well, of course you're gonna find  the customers that say they love you. Now it is true that sometimes what you're  doing is so radical or changes their life so much that having customers who are  willing to talk to venture capitalists, who serve as references ... Venture capitalists, less at  seed, more at later rounds, will check customer references. Those matter a lot. Yes.

Speaker 14: How important is it to mention when you're showing somebody your captive or snapshot of  equity whether you're dynamic or static equity splitting [inaudible] Does that even matter? Because it's  gonna-

Geoff Ralston: What does that mean, dynamic or statically-

Speaker 14: Dynamic equity split like a slice of the pie versus just a static, hey one  founder has 50 percent, one founder has 40 percent-

Geoff Ralston: I've never seen this dynamic thing. People should know what they have. You mean dynamic  based on performance or something?

Speaker 14: No, it's based on how much time you're putting in versus your fair market value  as an-

Geoff Ralston: Oh, so you're sort of vesting into your ... If you have a vesting schedule,  that's fine. You can show them that. I don't think it matters. The math is  the same in the end, right? Yes.

Speaker 15: Common splits for ... How much equity do people generally sell off at say, A,  B, and C?

Geoff Ralston: The question is, what sort of dilution should you expect at each stage in the  company? There's just very general rules of thumb for that. We usually say 10 percent  to maybe 20 percent at seed. If you sell as much as 30 percent, we  start to get a little squirrelly. It happens sometimes. 20, 25 percent, sometimes 30 percent  at Series A. After that, it's too variable to talk about. It depends on how  well the company's going. Series B's are usually 20 percent or less, but again, it  really depends.

Speaker 15: Thanks so much.

Geoff Ralston: Sure. Yes.

Speaker 16: What's a good way to research angels and VCs [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: The question is, what's the best way to research angels and VCs? Of course, the  best way is to get into YC, so should try; because we have a database.  There is lots of information online that you can look up, but I would also  ... I think the very best thing to do is to talk to as many  founders as you can, who are familiar ... You can look up what their portfolio  company is and see if you know anyone in that portfolio company. Try to get  connected to someone who has some knowledge of how that investor was. Yeah.

Speaker 17: Hi, there. I have a blockchain company. How do I address traditional VCs that are  a bit cautious when it comes to blockchain? On the other hand, how do I  address blockchain VCs or investors that expect cryptocurrencies and programs which I do not provide?  Incredible , 10X, 100X, [inaudible] How do I address both of these worlds?

Geoff Ralston: This is an individual question for his company which is ... It seems like it's  a blockchain company without crypto. I'm not really sure I know what that means, but  ... The question was, how do I address conventional VCs that are afraid of blockchain  and non-conventional blockchain investors who expect him to be more crypto-y or something? I don't  know. You have to tell a really good story to each. A lot of conventional  investors just won’t go there for good reason. There's so much fraud and so much  uncertainty outside of the fraud in that space, in the ICO space, especially, that a  lot of people run away. I would tend to just stay with the investors who  are familiar with it and then explain why whatever strange configuration of your company makes  sense for you.

Speaker 18: I wanna come back to the $150,000 new deal from YC.

Geoff Ralston: The new deal?

Speaker 18: Yes. I'm trying to understand because generally companies can raise their seed or post-seed after  YC or maybe a few months after and $150,000 suggests to me [inaudible] . Is  that where companies are gonna raise money or how does that work [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: The question is, does YC's $150,000 investment handicap the companies that do YC because the  imputed value of the company is too low. It's not a problem. Look, we don't  even actually have a cap on our investment because we don't think it's appropriate to  think of it that way. We've been investing at this level for many years now  and the vast majority of companies that go through YC raise seed and the average  cap tends to be over $8,000,000 now; so it's clearly not a handicap. The reason  you do YC is because it increases your value and increases your probability of success.  Investors get that, so they don't look at that ... They look at that as  sort of the cost of doing business with YC.

Speaker 18: So YC is not that [inaudible] add more money [inaudible] to invest at a [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Correct. Yes. This is gonna be the last question, so hopefully it's a good one.

Speaker 19: I just [inaudible] prediction [inaudible] because one of the way to reach the investor that  at some point your company will [inaudible] company. That's some advice I got from [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: I'm not sure I understand, the question is something to do with, how can you  square the fact that we're supposed to be $1,000,000,000 company and yet we don't make  financial projections? Do I have that right?

Speaker 19: Yeah, when you sort of discouraged making long term financial predictions-

Geoff Ralston: You shouldn't make long term financial projections that are complete and utter bullshit. The vast  majority of you who try to make a long term financial projection pre-product or when  you have one or two customers, it's a joke. You can't do that. If an  investor asks you to do that, they're not very smart. Or they're not very good  investors. However, that doesn't mean you can't talk about your opportunity. You can't talk about  the fact that look, this business opportunity is enormous. We have these customers who have  started using our product in a very fundamental, very deep way and they're gonna be  our customers forever. It shows the customer need. There's many, many, many thousands of those  customers. If I just get five percent of that customer base, I'll have $100,000,000 in  revenue and then I'm a billion dollar company. That's different than making a financial projection.  You're not actually projecting the time frame to get to five percent, you're just saying,  "Imagine if we got those customers". Thanks very much guys. We'll see you next week.
