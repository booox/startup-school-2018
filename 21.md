# A Conversation on Hard Tech with Eric Migicovsky

- Welcome. We have Eric here today, so Eric is a YC partner. He was previously the CEO and founder of Pebble, which went through the YC batch, in all the way winter of 2011.

- A long, long time ago.

-You're an old man, Eric.

- It was back in, so now we have the other building on the other side, but my YC batch was one of the last ones in the small building.

- Yeah. You actually, it was called Alerta when you applied.

- Yep, and our product was called Impulse.

- Impulse.

- Yes, we had a whole bunch of complicated names.

-How did you...? I mean Pebble's a great name. How did you end up on that?

- How did we get to a much better name?

- Yeah

- You go through a lot of worse names on the way. I think the original names were found using a thesaurus or some sort of, like we just scanned through a book for words that were related to alerting, Alerta. That was how we got to it.

- Yeah.

- Originally. Pebble was a much better name. I actually thought of it while lying on a beach and it was like two years before we actually made Pebble. I just like wrote it down in Evernote, on a list of good names.

- Nice

- You have no idea when you're gonna use another name, so if you get any good ones, just write 'em down.

-So today, I wanna spend a little time talking about hardware startups, given you ran one, especially one that was one of the larger hardware startups in the past few years, but then spend the bulk of the time talking about hard tech. Because you spend a lot of time working with hard tech, or deep tech, whatever we wanna call it.

- Here at YC.

- Here at YC.
And there are a lot of unknowns still out there, and we obviously want to fund more of those kind of startups. So starting with Pebble, so can you take us through the quick story of when you came to YC how big were you? What did you do in YC? Like, that's actually a common question of what hardware startups actually do at YC in a few months.

- So we applied to YC, started the company in 2008. Started working on it while I was still a student at Waterloo. Kept working on it through 2010. We hadn't actually shipped, or we were just starting to ship the product to first customers, this is before Pebble, back in mid 2010, and I'd been on Hacker News forever, but I had never really understood what Y Combinator was. I just thought it was like a domain name for Hacker News, and one day someone said, hey, you should check out YC, and so just on a whim, we applied.
The video we recorded, if I look back at it, was during Octoberfest in Kitchener, Waterloo, where I was living, and we were wearing Octoberfest hats in the video. We applied. For some crazy reason, Paul Graham, Jessica, and the gang decided to accept us, even though I think we were the third hardware company that got through. We started YC in 2011, in the winter, and the company, the stage of the company was we had shipped maybe, I think, 2 or 300 of our very first watch, the watch that was called the Impulse that worked with Blackberry smart phones, and we had some early customers. We were getting money, or we were earning some money. Hadn't raised much. I think I borrowed 15,000 bucks from my parents, got some government grants in Canada, which was quite easy, but we hadn't raised any money from investors. YC was the first investor.

- So 15,000 dollars let you manufacture you said the first 100 units?

- We ended up making them one by one, actually, so the first watches, for this first watch, they were manufactured, we bought the circuit boards from China. We had the metal, the kind of metal casing of the watch made at a small metal shop. A guy had a 5 axis CNC printer, or a mill, and he actually just like, he read about us in the school newspaper, or something like that, and offered to be our first shop for making the actual metal cases, so metal case would get made, just a couple blocks away. We'd get the circuit boards shipped in from China. We also made the plastic watch straps in China, and then we would do the final assembly one by one in the garage, and I think that early process of making everything one by one was perfect for us, because we screwed up everything you could possibly screw up in the first 10 watches. We had a lot of problems, but we had a problem with our app. We couldn't get the signal out of the watch, because it's like a Faraday cage sitting on your wrist, and so we said, well maybe let's change the metal back for a plastic back, and so we had a whole bunch of laser cut acrylic sheet plastic cut to the same size as the back of the watch and we kind of jammed it in, and then we shipped the first 10 of them out by FedEx, and on something like 7 out of the 10 the electronics just exploded out the back of the plastic, and people would show us pictures of this watch that they just bought with the guts just everywhere, and so we adjusted the thing. We started putting a piece of foam rubber inside the watch, so when we shipped it, the backs wouldn't explode. But it was a really good thing that we were making them one by one or else we could have potentially made hundreds with that same problem, right? At the beginning, and had lost basically everything, so we, I think we iterated really quickly and when we screwed up it was only a maximum of like a pretty small screw up.

- Got it.
And how many units had you sold before you actually went through the entire manufacturing process?

- We continued to manufacture one by one by hand up until around 700, 800 units.

- Wow.

- So even when, so one of the things that people ask often about YC is like well what happens if I have to move my business to Mountain View? It's gonna interrupt my production process or whatever, so what we did was I hired a couple high school students and I asked one of my friends who I went to school with, who was doing his master's back at Waterloo to just kind of like manage and run the production thing, and they would ship 'em down here and we would finish it in our house that we were all living at, and so I think the trick there was we didn't let the fact that we had to be here in Mountain View interrupt our actual sales process.

- And so after YC, Pebble obviously took off, and lots of great things happened. What were the, I mean you went through lots of ups and downs.

- It was a year after YC. It wasn't like immediately after. It took a long time.

- Yeah, so what was the hardest part, maybe? Out of your whole journey with Pebble?

- Looking back, I think it's different, because, you know, seeing it forward, it actually took us a long time to get from the initial idea to any sort of real product/market fit. It was five years. So we started the company in 2008, built the initial prototype late 2008, 2009, didn't start shipping until 2010, and that was for our first watch, and then we had a lot of lessons learned from that first production run, and then we redesigned and created what would become Pebble in 2012. So that's five years, and the hardest thing, like I would say we've worked with a lot of founders, and the hardest question that I think I ever get as someone who helps startups is how do I know that what I'm working on is the right thing to work on? How do I know that this little pivot that I could do is not the right one? Like, maybe I should try that.
And there's no answer to this. It is the hardest problem.
And so I, thinking back, I think it was probably very misguided in that I just had faith, and I just never gave up, even though now thinking back it's insane doing something for five years. Like what's the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing, and hoping for different results? Like I was basically doing that for five years, like we were just, I guess we didn't know what we didn't know. Like we were very naive, and we had a very small amount of money, and we didn't know that you're not supposed to make consumer hardware products on a budget of 40,000 dollars. Like most electronics that you use are made with budgets of millions of dollars.

- I mean, but now that you've done it, or you did do it, do you think it's possible now?

- Oh, it's totally possible. No, what I'm saying is I think like the hardest part that we had to go through was not letting other people get us down, and kind of like maintaining that naivet√©. One of the things that I really love about that phase of the startup was people couldn't really convince us that what we were doing was wrong, because no one had really done it before, and if people said, like, oh, you should look at raising more money or something like that, we didn't really have the resources to do that. Like we were a very constrained, naive team, and so we had to figure it out, and I think some of the ways that I could have screwed it up was actually the ways that I did screw it up was right after YC, we raised a bit of money, about 250,000 dollars, including this large check that we got from one investor, and I took all that money and invested it in inventory, because I thought at the time the biggest constraint on us growing was we didn't have a reliable, like we didn't have a large amount of inventory. We were making them by hand. So we only had like 10 or 50 a week.
And I was under the mistaken impression that if we could start selling it in real time rather than saying we'll do a pre order and sell it to you in a couple weeks, that our sales would have taken off more, because then we tried this. We manufactured, instead of making them by hand, in our garage, we went to a small contract manufacturer in San Jose and manufactured 3,000 at once, and spent all of our money on that, and you can all see where this story is going, it takes longer than you expect to bring up a new manufacturer, so it took six months or eight months instead of three months. It cost more than we expected, so the BOM cost rose, and then by the time we actually manufactured them, that eight months rolled around, our email list of potential customers had kind of dried up. Everyone had switched from Blackberry to using iPhones, and then we were stuck with a whole bunch of inventory, so yeah, that was a really rough, difficult part.

- Yeah, it's often, not always, but in many cases people get really creative when they don't have much money, and they have to get really scrappy, and then when they raise a ton of money, they forget how to do that.

- And it happened to me again, like three years later. Like we raised a bunch of money and then started hiring, and this is a big problem, that even mostly the successful companies run into, and so I think the moral of the story for me at least is how I think about projects that I work on, is like, that frugality is vital to me. Not everyone has the same, and not every industry is exactly the same.
There's a few crazy industries right now which are kind of by definition the opposite of frugal. I'm thinking of the scooter share companies, where it's a matter of raising as much money as physically possible, but for the vast majority of people, like staying frugal is what actually...

- Yeah, if you don't have network, like obvious network effects, or first mover advantage, then usually you should go down the other path. So Pebble is known as one of the most, you did one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter, and so a lot of people view crowdfunding as a way in lieu of fundraising, to do that route. So I think there are a lot of questions on when is the right time to do it, especially like at what point do I need a product that is real and works? Do I need to align that with the crowdfunding campaign? And so forth, so what's your advice on that?

- I have a, after having gone through a couple of these cycles, here's my advice. I think crowdfunding can be useful for two specific points. Mainly useful for two specific points in a startup's life. You could use crowdfunding at the very early stage, when you have an idea on the back of a napkin, maybe a render or two, to raise 25, 50,000 dollars that can help you get to a working prototype. This is for people who are software engineers, and are experimenting or want to work with hardware. This is for hardware engineers who have zero money and they just wanna prove that some people want their product. So I wanna be very specific. This is an intention play. It's not trying to build like a multi million dollar campaign with super fancy CGI graphics, and overproduced videos. I'm talking about people honestly saying I just need a little bit of money to get this idea off the ground.
And I think there's an opportunity to use crowdfunding right there. It can be as simple as just emailing a bunch of your friends and saying, hey, do you wanna just, do you want one of these? This is like the best test that you can have for early product/market fit, is do your friends and family actually wanna pay you money for what you're making? Or do early customers actually wanna pre pay for what you're making? It's not perfect, because, you know, they may wanna try it first or something like that, but if you are making something that people really want, they're basically throwing their money at you, so that's an opportunity for this early crowdfunding. I really encourage people to not try to do the marketing blowout campaign at the start for two reasons. One is just looking back, most of those campaigns, even if they do succeed at raising money, usually fail to produce and actually ship their product, and I think the reason why is going through the cycle of having to make something and ship it to customers is really educational, and you also learn what people like about your product, and what they don't like, as quickly as, like you reduce the amount of time between you having the idea and you getting validation of do people actually want this idea? So that's the first I think opportunity for crowdfunding. I think there's actually another opportunity using it more as like a marketing and sales channel, which is I think more of what we did, where we had already made, most people don't know this, but when we launched our Kickstarter campaign, we had already made and sold around 1,500 of our first watch, and so we had gone through all the pain and the cycle of building that, and we had a really good idea of what Pebble should look like, because we had feedback from about 1,500 individuals who were like super eager early adopters, very open with their feedback, and we tuned and tweaked the product, so I think there's kind of like two separate crowdfunding opportunities in a consumer product's life cycle. I think too often people blend them together, or they don't know which path they're on, and so they kind of screw it up.
They, there's actually a couple other platforms for this early crowdfunding.
There's Kickstarter and Indiegogo and that kind of thing, but there's also There's Crowd Supply.
There's like Hack a Day forums.
There's a lot of really niche areas where you could, you could go to a Discord server and say, like, who wants to buy? You don't have to use the big Kickstarter platforms for that early phase.

- Do you suggest having a date in which I can promise you I can actually deliver this? 'Cause if I'm using Kickstarter with the first route, maybe I don't know that I can deliver within six months. Is there like a certain time period in which I know I can deliver then I do that?

- Yeah, and if you're not, like I would encourage, if you're not confident in your ability to ship it, then don't use one of these crowdfunding platforms where it's very shipping centric.
There's other options.
And again, I really do encourage going through that first cycle to find out things like, how long does it take me to make things? Do I have all the skills on my team? Or do I actually have to find people potentially in the community, to help contribute software? Or other skills to the team? Again, too many people I see they skip that step and they try to go directly to the high powered marketing campaign, and it's just such a sad time most of the time.

- Yeah, and sometimes there's like a group, you're trying to go after the group before the early adopters, 'cause on Kickstarter, those are kind of early adopters.

- Yeah.

- But there's a group before that.

- Exactly, exactly, and I think for your given industry and for your given product category, you should be able to find it. Like sometimes it's as simple as going on a sub Reddit. Like we've had some great companies come through YC, and they do their initial sales just by earning credibility in a Facebook group, or they earn credibility in a Reddit group, or Discord, like there's a ton of customers there.

- Cool. So when you talked about Pebble earlier, you talked about hiring people and outsourcing things. What's the right call in terms of outsourcing the various components?

- So this is a really hard question for hard tech companies, because more often than not, the skill sets that you'll need to build your products are actually quite varied. You may need a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, a computer engineer, some production people, office people, and you don't necessarily need 100% of that person all the time. You need like 15% or 20% for three weeks, and then you're back to not needing an electrical engineer, so the best way to solve this is to have really flexible technical people on your team, where you guys can just kind of incorporate everything and just do it yourself, because those teams move so much faster than teams that require an external process. Some of the most painful moments of my early career were not having full time cofounders, and having to work with contractors or consultants who honestly like, you can't pay someone enough to care. I mean, firstly because you probably don't have that much money, but also because people who are working on contract, they're just set up to not have the same motivations, the same alignments as someone who's working 24/7 trying to get their fledgling startup off the ground has. You run into time commitments. I just had an email the other day from a founder who's like, yeah, our intern went back to school.
And he was developing a large portion of our company.

- Oh

- And so yeah, so like I actually opt for in the early days, and pretty much all days, trust and dependability and kind of smartness over very specific deep domain specific knowledge in who I'm looking to hire.

- So last question on hardware specifically, there's this common saying or adage or whatever you wanna call it that's like, hardware, you can't just build hardware. You have to have a software component so that it scales, so you can have a subscription service on top of it, instead of just the one off type purchase. How much do you believe in that? Or what do you think about people who say that all the time?

- So I've been working on, I've been doing a bit of research into this category. This really got me interested right after Pebble, because that was some feedback that we often got. Could you launch a subscription service? Could you have some sort of payment subscription? And you've heard of product/market fit, right? The idea that customers really in a particular market are going after your product. I actually think there's something called business model/company fit, where you could have the best product on the world. You could actually have product/market fit, but if you have the wrong business model, you're not gonna be able to fund and grow your company over the long term. So it's kind of like an advanced thing, like you don't need to worry about this if you don't have product/market fit because if you don't have product/market fit, you don't have a company. But we ran into a problem pretty soon after we hit product/market fit, misunderstanding what was the business model that was gonna drive this company? And I think there's actually seven or eight or nine different business models that are lanes that hardware companies or hard tech companies can use. I've been working on just researching and putting companies into different categories and you have the subscription companies, like the Nests or the Dropcams of the world that are selling, Ring, healthy 3 to 10 dollar subscriptions per month, but then you see other companies that try to do something similar, and it just does not work, and I think that's because, so in our case we didn't struggle I think with subscriptions. We experimented with it. It wasn't really gonna work for us, but the way that we screwed it up was we didn't understand that we were in a hits driven market. Hits driven being you come out with a consumer product, hopefully it's a hit. It hits that product/market fit, and people start pulling it out of your hands. Similar to a game company, we didn't realize that we had to be super frugal, super low budget as we developed the new products and kind of tried to engineer another hit. Our first product was certainly a hit. I don't think we ever reached escape velocity to a hit with any of our later products, and I think if we had built a more frugal organization. If we were able to build products cheaper, and then launch them and test to see if they were successful, and if they were successful, scale it up, et cetera, I think we might have had a slightly different outcome. I mean, it kind of goes back to like there are these different models for hardware companies, and you need to make sure that you are on the right one. You have to question yourself, and be like, should we really be on a subscription model? Is this really what customers are gonna want? Would they want to spend 5 dollars, 10 dollars a month, and you can't force it.
And if you force it, like I think we tried to do, you might add extra problems like on top of just building great products for your customers.

- So pivoting a little bit to hard tech, so we've funded lots of cool hard tech companies lately, quantum computing, self driving cars, 3D printing entire homes, so on and so forth.

- Agriculture technology.

- Yeah, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion.

- Aerospace, space.

- Space, yes, rockets. Lots of satellites and rockets. So maybe we can calibrate the conversation a little bit. How do you define hard tech, deep tech, what does that really involve?

- For me, I think what I'm excited about in harder technology spaces is the, in the software world, the iteration cycles are quite short. You can push code to your repo and have it go live within seconds, and so you can rapidly iterate on your product, can get feedback from your customers. I think hard tech companies can't.
They don't have the same rapid iteration cycle.
The either have hardware in the mix, which kind of is not at that same speed yet, though it is dramatically decreasing in the amount of time that each iteration cycle takes, or you might have some sort of fundamental technology that you're working on that needs to be developed in order to unlock a new business model or a new use case, or you might be regulatorily constrained, either in the medical device space, drone space, transportation space, self driving car space, these are all like, there's external processes that you can't control that affect your iteration cycle time.

- So say I have this crazy idea, something to do with rockets or something insane to most people, normal to me of course.

- Except a rocket scientist.

-Yeah.
And I have no money. Where do I even start? What do I do?

- It doesn't cost that much money to get started these days. You can do something like Startup School where they give you free money to invest in, like if you're working on AR and machine learning, you can use that to get compute credits.

- Well maybe a better question is what is an MVP?

- For most of these harder tech? So for medical devices, I think the MVP is successfully peer reviewed science, that supports what you're working on that there's some sort of opportunity here, and an understanding of what you're path to clearance is. Those are in my opinion I think the best companies, because they're the ones who have shown that they understand which business model they're in, and they know what it's gonna take, what's gonna be taken of them to get sales.
They don't necessarily have to be too far along that path.
And I think at that stage, investors start to get excited, when they see the mating of science and a use case. We've had a bunch of companies that are working on rockets and satellites and propulsion and that kind of thing. For those cases, it's usually some sort of subset, scaled representation of what you're working on.
And customers, so in all cases even if you're working on regulatory constrained products, having customers either contributing money to you, like through early contracts, or further along on the pilot track, the better. I think oftentimes engineers, we love to build things. We don't as much love to sell them, and so what I look for in early stage companies is are the founders technically competent? And do they understand that they're gonna have to perverse themselves to become salespeople? Or not?

- What do you find by demo day, when they're in front of lots of investors, what is it that you encourage them to accomplish by then? It sounds like there's two paths.
There's business, if you can do sales, there's no regulatory issues to doing sales. You should have some paid contracts, LOIs maybe, and then also technical validation. Like proof that you can actually build this.

- Yeah, and I think too often people convolve these and they say I don't wanna do sales until I have something that I can show to them. That's just not true. Most customers, if you explain that they have a problem, and you have a way to solve it, they'll get excited, and if they're not excited, it's probably a sign that they don't really have a problem. That they wanna solve.
And so oftentimes we get companies that come in at the beginning of YC, and they say, well we wanna spend the first two months working on improving the prototype and getting it to the point where we're proud of it.
And then we'll do sales in the last month, and we kind of flip that around. Do the sales, hit the pavement, talk to customers, and you'll actually build a better first product for them, than if you just built it first and then showed it.

- It also gives you confidence that you're going down the right track. If someone gives you...

- Yeah, and it's hard. Like we had a company in the last batch that had been working for two years on building a prototype.
They were commercializing some technology that they worked on in a university, and it had a hardware component, and I remember seeing, I think it was their third application, second or third application to YC, and they had similar videos of them doing the demo with their technology, and we liked their commitment, like they had been coming back and their technology was getting better, and they were just starting to talk to customers, and we said, let's give 'em a shot, so we brought 'em in for an interview, accepted them in, and then basically the first week we took 'em aside and just said, you need to start selling. You need to get people excited and interested, and it was almost like a 180 for them, because they thought that we were gonna say you should work on the technology and get to the point where you have working units, widgets that you can sell, and we said no. Start going and talking to customers, and it took a little while for them to get up to speed. It's like exercising a new muscle, especially for engineers, and within the span of two months, they went through several roller coasters of having zero leads to having a whole bunch of leads to having them all collapse, and no one's signing, and then probably like six or seven weeks into YC, they sent us a note, and they were like, we got our first contract, and then they got their second contract, and they got their third, and then by demo day, they had already line on four or five million dollars in sales, and it all happened in the span of three months because they stopped working necessarily on just building their technology.
They were still working, like they had a three or four person team, so they were able to split it up, but the focus, the number one goal became how do we get sales.

- So, say, I mean you do a lot of trips where you go to schools, specifically, and you talk to scientists and engineers, many in PhD programs. I guess what is your advice to them to make the jump? What should they consider? A lot of them are thinking about commercializing it, but maybe they think, I don't know what they think, actually. But what is your one-two punch on that?

- Having started my company in a university town, versus somewhere here like Silicon Valley, I felt very protected.
There were a lot of government grants. I was able to raise non diluted funding, and plus side is we were able to use that funding to work on the project, but the downside was, there was no pressure to have some sort of product that customers would pay money for. It wasn't really in the DNA of the startup ecosystem that I was in. Most people were just entranced with working on their startup, and not necessarily getting to that next stage of building a profitable, longer term corp, and I think that that sometimes affects people who are in universities even more, because the default is raising money through grants and working on longer term projects, whereas the special case is spinning out a company and actually trying to get customers to buy it.
And I think what I would encourage is try getting out of your comfort zone. Just as an experience, or experiment. Don't say that you have to dive in head first with no parachute, but if you're working on some sort of technology that you think could have some sort of positive business impact, like get out of the lab. Go to some conferences. Talk to people. Not educational conferences, like corporate, sales conferences. Start talking to customers, and see what people think.
And that's a start.
And hopefully, I mean if you're lucky and things are in the right spot, again customers will be like where has this been all my life. Like this is amazing. This is exactly what we've been dreaming of. I can't believe it finally came out of the lab, and that should be the momentum that just pulls you along, but you have to get out to at least try it.

- So say you get to the point where you feel confident you have some amount of interest in your product. But to actually build it, you need lots and lots and lots of money. What do you need to show to investors?

- So the best companies in my opinion are the ones that don't require a ton of money to work on, or at least to get to some sort of MVP stage, kind of like with all advice that YC gives, it's usually applicable to 90% of the companies, and then there's always 5% on either side that are in a special case. But even some of the best hard tech companies I've seen, they don't have a binary outcome where they need someone to insert 100 million dollars, and that's the only thing that can develop a product. Like take, I mean, I don't know anything about these companies other than press reports, but take Magic Leap versus Oculus, right? Magic Leap raised lots of money, and spent 11 years working on a product, versus Oculus which raised two million dollars on Kickstarter, shipped an early development kit that was not amazing, but they iterated, and they got through, and now the Oculus, the new one that's like 400 bucks, doesn't need a computer, it's exactly, yeah, the Quest. Like that's exactly what people are dreaming of now.
And they're gonna have it within six months, and they had to go through six, seven years of painful iteration, but they did it.
And yeah.

- So last question, then we're take audience questions. What's an idea, just so curious, what's an idea that sounded so crazy to you when you heard about it, but then when you met the founder and they stepped through everything, you were like, oh, that's not so crazy. This is totally possible.

- Relativity Space. So, that was a company that went through YC four, three years ago, not very long.
They wanted to build 3D printed rockets.
Their thesis was it's not actually rocket assembly that costs a lot of money. It's the testing phase of integration, where if you have hundreds of different systems that have to work perfectly with each other, when you assemble and build the final rocket, you have to test everything. Slightly different path than SpaceX which is going for the reusability thing. So their thesis was if we can 3D print the entire rocket, from the tip of the exhaust to the motor to everything, in one piece, the integration time is zero. Because you just print it. So they're working on this, and it was just an idea. I think they did a Hot Fire during YC. I think they were working on it, I don't know exactly how long they had been working on it for, but yeah, that's a pretty crazy idea, and to come through YC, especially to pitch to investors that probably were not all space investors, must have taken some guts, but they did it.
They showed off their first 3D printed rocket.
They raised early funding off of that.
They started work on their larger products, and raised a whole bunch more money. I think they just raisedlast year.

- They also, they worked previously at SpaceX or Blue Origin, but they didn't have many years of experience, so it was kind of actually crazy in the sense also they were extremely young, and for this kind of thing to think of this.

- Yeah, and people believed in their vision.
They had demonstrated it enough. I think, of what they were working on.
And I think it was actually interesting, so I think they, I don't wanna say to much in case I'm wrong, but I think they were working on the printer first, and they were looking for an application for this massive metal 3D printer that they had built, and they found space as the, I mean it was their background, and their passion, so I think that's the one that they took it in, that direction that they took it in. I see this a lot with people who are working on really cool, kind of fundamental technology, I think PG actually had a pretty good tweet about this a couple of weeks ago. He said, if you're in a situation where you're building something that's mindblowingly cool and revolutionary, but you're finding that customers don't wanna buy it, pivot your company so you're actually doing what your customers would have done, and just use your pioneering technology to do what they do faster, better, or cheaper.
And sell to their customers.
And that's kind of I think what Relativity did, is they were building this new 3D printer, and they realized that we could just build rockets with this technology, and will be better than everyone else who's building rockets in that space.

- Cool, so questions? You first.

- [Audience Member] Speaking of that, we've actually sold cups of coffee at 40 bucks a piece now, but we're making equipment for coffee shops to eliminate bitterness, based on the founding technology, and how do you find those first customers? You did 1,500 Pebbles before you went public, but how did you get the 1 through 50?

- So the question was, how do you get your first customers? How do you get 1 through 50? I talked about this a little bit earlier. Some of the best ways is to infiltrate the community of people who you think will want your product.
There are an unlimited set of places on the internet where people talk about products and they talk about services.
They can range from, you know where the Whatsapp guy posted his app first? Back in 2009? He posted it on Flyer Talk forums, which is like a whole bunch of geeky business people how fly a lot, and that's where he posted it, and think about that as your first, as the first user group for Whatsapp. It's perfect, right? It's travelers who wanna talk to people all around the world, who are tired of paying for overpriced SMS bills, and it's 2009, so people are just starting to get smart phones and that kind of thing. Perfect, like you couldn't have planned it better if you tried, and so the best companies are the ones that just kind of get out there. For us, we got a lot of press in the early days by talking to bloggers, so I liked formed personal relationships with all of the Blackberry bloggers at the time, if anyone remembers Crackberry, Crackberry Kevin, yeah, and so I would like fly out to conferences, on dirt cheap red eyes, and just, instead of buying tickets to the conference, I think we would just kind of sneak around and get into the press, like once at CES, back in 2009, we just walked into Engadget's trailer, like Engadget had this big trailer where all their reporters were working, and we didn't know anyone, so we just walked in, and then just started pitching to people and ended up getting, there's like a picture of my wrist with a broken watch. It didn't even work at the time, but it's like, so and so is working on a smartwatch, and that drove a ton of traffic in the early days, was just people self identifying as this was something that I wanted.

- Yeah, it takes a lot of hustle, for sure. Okay, right here.

- [Audience Member] So Eric, we are in the business of, so we are software engineers only software, but not in hardware. So that's a struggle, is should we outsource that? Or no? Things have changed since, so...

- Yeah, things are much easier. So question is like, we're a bunch of software engineers. We have an idea that includes software and hardware, how do we get started on the hardware? Well the good news is that it's easier than ever. I wrote a blog post that was on TechCrunch a couple months ago about how software engineers can get started on this, and the recipe's pretty simple. Find an off the shelf product that kind of does what you want to do, that's kind of like halfway there, that you can actually just buy off Amazon, or Alibaba or something, because the amount of time and money and tears that you'll save just by buying a product that's halfway to what you wanna build will do a couple things. One is it will get you within two or three days, or however long shipping takes, an actual physical representation of what you think you wanna build, and you will begin to use it, hopefully, to solve the problem that you wanna solve, and you will learn, like, maybe I'm completely wrong, and this often happens.
The best intentioned product when you actually build it might not actually solve the problem that you wanna solve, so getting halfway there for like 200 bucks, or 300 bucks, plus shipping, is just so much better than weeks and months of prototyping just to get to the same level.
The next step after this is to take the 50% there product, or 75% there product, and hack it to do what you think is better. Either adding a little bit of technology onto it, and adding your software stack, modifying it. It can be as simple as repurposing the same technology and like changing the set up. A good example of this would be the scooter companies.
They took Xiaomi Scooters, Ninebot scooters, and they just glued on cell modems. That's it. That's how scooter sharing started. It's like cell modems and GPS plus a scooter.
They didn't build the scooter themselves.
They just bought it off Alibaba, and they bought the modems from some company that was making modems, so that's kind of the prototype I think for the next generation of consumer hardware, as well as enterprise hardware. We had a company two batches ago that builds cameras for neighborhood security and they used a Raspberry Pi and a Pi Cam, and a 3D printed case.
And they sold those for like hundreds, thousands of dollars.
And the hardware cost a very small amount of money, and they're just solving a real problem for end customers, and people are paying them in exchange for that. So, yeah, it's easier than ever. You can find people on Alibaba. You can meet factories over WeChat. Just don't try to build it all yourself. Don't hire an industrial design firm to build you some new design. Don't hire an engineering firm that promises to do a custom design for you, because that'll cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it probably will be the wrong product versus spending 300 bucks, buying something, meeting the factory that makes that current product, and asking them to make the changes that you wanna make.

- [Audience Member] Before product/market fit, do you recommend founders to move closer to the supplier do places like Shenzhen or Beijing?

- It depends, so the question is, should you move closer to Shezhen or factories when you are pre product/market fit? If you're pre product/market fit, and you have a product that you're iterating on, like figure out a way to reduce the iteration cycles, so that you get more chances to dazzle customers, and to find that product/market fit. So you could solve that two ways. If you think that moving to the factories will enable you to do faster iteration, and you already have sales channels set up, that's cool. If not, and you don't really have that many customers, then move closer to your customers, so that the iteration can be done in software, maybe, not hardware, and you're just spending every minute in front of your customers, so we have a couple companies that did that in the last batch, and they were using drones to solve very specific business process problems, and they basically just moved to where those businesses are, took up a crappy motel room, and turned that motel room into a drone factory, where they were making and modifying their drone. In that case, it was probably the right call for them.

- Right here.

- [Audience Member] Do we have to protect our products? Or how can we protect them?

- Protection, IP protection. Trademark protection. Is that kind of what you're interested in? So yeah, patents, that kind of thing. So, this question I think touches on how do you build a moat for your company? How do you make sure that once you figure out a beautiful product, figure out who to sell it to, that some other dude doesn't come along and just steal your idea? So there's a couple ways that you can solve this.
The best ways in my opinion are companies that have some sort of innate moat where, it's either network effect, where the more people that use your product, the better it is for everyone. Or some sort of data lock in, where you use the product, you generate data.
The data happens to be within one ecosystem. Someone who builds a competing piece of hardware can't get that data easily. Those are the two best, but what do you think about that?

- I think those are good. I also think patents previously used to be very hard to get, but now, there's like, we have a company called Cognition IP. I would just use them, and just pay them some little amount of money, and then get patents.

- They use software to help you file. So the problem with patents is that they're not, like if you're thinking about this problem, specifically how do we block other people from copying our idea, they're actually really difficult tools to use. Versus those other two things that I described that are actually, like you control all of the levers. If you can build a product that has built in network effect, or build in data things, you control that. Like you don't have to rely on lawyers. You don't have to rely on the government. You don't have to rely on the courts to enforce your domain dominance, but if you rely on patents, that kind of thing, you're basically saying, I'm putting this money down as an investment, but I'm gonna have to invest a lot more money later, in order to unlock that first investment, so it's very rare that startups build a successful moat using patents. This happens much more in like biotech, space.

- Yes, yeah, I agree with that. I think building really great products is really just the only way to really build the moat.

- Again, for 5% of companies, there might be some sort of patent strategy, but for 95%, it's great products.

- Yeah, I think if it's also easy to build, people can just copy it, even if you get the patent, so it doesn't really matter.

- Well that's the thing. You need money to enforce the patents. You need time to enforce it, and if your company's dead, it's hard to enforce patents.

- Cool, back there.

- [Audience Member] If you're building a product which is trying to solve a hard, hard tech problem, like solving social media disruption with AI, how do you convince people that you can get a lot of different users when you're going after what looks like a very marginal market to?

- Marginal markets are great So the question was, what happens if I'm building a hard tech problem, trying to solve a longer term problem. That first problem that I'm solving, what if it looks too small? Honestly, the best investors will wanna see a small market. Because a small market at the beginning means you can identify who's in that market very cheaply, versus having to boil the ocean, saying well there's like 2% of all people in the world who are interested, versus like 80% of this one group. So it's cheaper and easier for you to find those customers.
The second thing is that small group of people will tell you quicker whether you have a good product or not, because they know that they have a problem, and you're telling them hey, buy this thing, it solves your problem.
They can use it and be like, oh yeah, that solves it. Good. Problem solved.
They'll give you feedback. Whereas if you're trying to again target a really large group with a vague product idea, it's gonna be harder to know whether that person just wasn't interested that week. Maybe they didn't have enough money.
There's more reasons than you had a bad product, if it's a really vague and large market.

- Yeah, just to add onto that I think starting small is good, but also having a roadmap to how it builds into something big is good as well, for investors, specifically.

- And for yourself as well, to know if like, to keep motivated.

- [Audience Member] What do you think about theof hardware service? Because now I think there's a shift between direct sells to subscription model a lot, because hardware companies can't rely only on sales.

- Yep.

- They always need to have recurring revenue. So in my company, by chance, we just are doing some electronic treatment for reducing sweating, and we are so happy that people are lined up to come to our office and to treatment for that, but will this be reliable, or will it mean that?

- So this question is related to like, do I pick a recurring business model, subscription business model? Hardware as a service? Or do I just sell the product? So this kind of goes back to what I was talking about before. Which is making sure that you have the right, you're pretty sure that you're in the right business model track for your company. So, there are a lot of these different tracks.
They're not just hardware as a service, not just consumer.
There's hybrid models.
There's insurance models.
There's advertising driven models.
There's a ton of different ways that you could look at it, so it's not just one or the other. Here's what I would say. On the enterprise side, you need to figure out how much money you will save your customer, or how much more money they will make, and price your product accordingly. Like, your product price to them will be less than either how much they're saving or how much more they're making, and you should try to price it as high as possible to still let them have some savings, but you should rightfully so earn some of the profit from that innovation that you have. Sometimes that may be a hardware as a service model. It might be up front, and it really depends on your customer at that point, so it's really hard for anyone to try to give advice on that front, and it's much more around talking to customers, experimenting, like you could do price experiments. Most companies are so small that every time a new person hears about them, or I'm sorry, every time they do PR, new people who've never heard about it will hear about it for the first time, and they won't know what the last price was, so you can afford to do that kind of experimentation, especially at the beginning of your company.

- [Audience Member] So one of the hardest problems of our space is hiring, is creating the company.

- Yep. How do you do hiring, especially when you're scaling? Hiring is a mode that the company's in, and it's a very distracting mode. So I think like the mission of an early stage startup is to get to product/market fit, and it's definitely not to hire a team. No one gets points for hiring a team, or you get a very small number of points for hiring an amazing team. You get a lot more points for finding a product that has product/market fit. So, hiring in general is really like a touchy subject because there's no one size fits all there. Some general advice that I have is what I mentioned before, just hire for trust, and hire for reliability over hiring for specific domain knowledge. This has really benefited me because right after we kind of hit on Kickstarter, we were only two people at the company, two full time people, and two interns, and so we had like nobody, and all of a sudden we needed to hire people, and we could've spent three to six months hiring a 30 person team, and people that we would need, hire experts that have done it before. We could have spent the time doing that. We would have delayed our initial production by probably three to six months, however long it would have taken to hire that team, so what I did instead was I just phoned up some of my best friends from university who had been tangentially involved in the project, and said, you need to quit your job and just fly here, and I think all of them, we just hired seven people within three or four days, like that, and that worked because we had that momentum and we had found product/market fit, and so they were like, that's cool. I wanna be part of this rocket ship. I wanna take off. But we didn't have to do like three to six months worth of hiring. We did three to six days worth of hiring, and I knew them. I trusted them.
They were instantly part of the team, because it was just like we were working on another school project again.

- It seems like the best source pool is either people you met in college, or from working.

- Past jobs you've had. Yeah, too often people overlook someone that they worked at a job with two, three years ago. One of the coolest hacks that you can do is just look through, manually, slowly, look through your Facebook or Linked In, and just look at every person's name and think, is this person cool? And technical? And just go through that list, and you're probably find a cofounder. You'll probably find a first employee, like some long lost friend from high school that's actually like a super cool developer, you could hire her and just bring her on the team. Like there's...

- The second step people miss then is actually asking that person, and giving a real offer.

- Yeah.

- There's always a, people do this ambiguous dance of like, oh, I don't want you to say no to me, and so I'm not gonna really ask you, and.

- So there's a good book called the Hard Thing about Hard Things, by Ben Horowitz, and he talks a lot about working with friends, and the difficulties and benefits of working with friends, so I'd read that book if you do end up hiring, or working with a bunch of your friends.

- Right back there. Yeah.

- [Audience Member] When you look at a problem and on one hand, you're like well, this might be solved with a, but it also can be a problem Is there any advice? Like oh you definitely need?

- Is there a, the question was, for some projects, problems can be solved exclusively by software. How do you know when to involve hardware into it? When in doubt, take all the hardware out. It doesn't solve the problem. That's the best place to start. That's why I was kind of saying like, how could you just buy something off the shelf and use it? Because you may need some hardware. You may need a camera. You may need a microphone. You may need a compute platform. Just buy a Raspberry Pi and plug USB devices into it. You don't need to build anything these days. Some people think like, but it's not gonna be in the right form factor, or it's not gonna do the exact right thing as what I think our customers need. Just try. Just build something. Hack something together, and see if it at least almost solves the problem, because like I was saying, more often than not, that initial test will prove that either you have a really good problem that really needs to be solved, or nobody really has that problem.
And you don't need to now spend three months working on custom hardware.

- [Audience Member] I think for hardware, custom hardware startup, it is very difficult to explain to investors, because the whole user experience makes a difference. So actually we are creating a holographic therapist, but it's very, theis very bad. It's made of, so it's very bad, so what is the best way toto investors? Making video or...?

- So your question was, we have a really complex product, an AI psychotherapist? Or therapist that can help people. How do we demo that? Or how do we convey that product to people? I would hazard a guess that it's kind of a similar question to the last one, that's like, are there ways that we can do this in software rather than hardware? So if I were working on a project like that, I might start by actually creating the assistant as an app first, or maybe like a 3D Unity character, that approximates it, that gets close to what you wanna do, or use an off the shelf device like a Hololens, or Magic Leap or something like that, where even though it costs way more than you think it's gonna cost in the future, this is kind of the trick. Overspend in the early days. Like spend more money that you have in order to get that first test done, if it's possible. If you don't have any money, then I guess you can't. But if you have a little bit of money, spend that 400 dollars to get an Oculus, so that you can simulate the experience in VR before you actually go and make the hardware.

- [Audience Member] If you're thinking about building the company. You have the product/market fit, from your own revenues and profits, and potentially getting loans from banks and things like that scale?

- So I think I would actually go one step above that and understand why hardware companies need financing. Usually it's for inventory. It's rare that a company will need to get funding for, I guess it's not rare, there's like funding for inventory, and there's funding for R and D. Funding for R and D is like, you need that. You can either get it through pre payments from potential customers. That's harder, but most people try to raise R and D funding from people like YC, or other investors. Banks will not lend you money for R and D. Your family might. So I would try to reduce that as much as possible. Try to spend as little money as possible, hacking together, prototyping, getting to the point where you know what product you're gonna build.
Then on the inventory financing side, here's the thing that I've learned. Inventory sucks. Inventory is one of the hardest things that hardware companies have to deal with. Because they can't make money, generally, until they have a product that they need to sell. It costs money to build that product, and it costs time to build that product, so you have what's called a cash conversion cycle where you may need to put inputs, dollars, into your product in order to get outputs down the road. Again, it is impossible, it is very difficult to manage inventory. So the better thing is actually to rise above it, and to get into a situation where you don't need to buy as much inventory.
There's two ways that you can do this. One is you can get customers to pre order. That's the easiest way, because then you have a very perfect idea of how many units you need to build. So that you can, and you can use that money from pre orders to actually fund the development. You don't need to raise money from VCs. You don't need to raise money from banks. That doesn't work always, but it does work in some crazy situations, like Xiaomi up until two or three years ago, sold their phones on Tuesday mornings. Like you couldn't go on the website and buy Xiaomi phones. You could only buy them Tuesday mornings, and so it was like a thing. Everyone would be at their computers on Tuesday mornings waiting for the latest drop of Xiaomi phones.
And they had a really short production cycle, like not a week, but they knew basically based on these Tuesday sales how many units they'd need to make over the next couple of weeks. OnePlus also did the same thing. So that's one way of doing it, the pre order route.
The other way is to change your product so that it takes a shorter amount of time to build. This is called reducing the lead times. So the benefit, the secret benefit of reducing your lead times is that you have to put less of your hard earned cash into inventory that will then take months to turn into actual revenue, so interestingly enough, sometimes it's in your best interest to pay more for the product, pay more for the BOM, the building materials. Pay more for the components, if the lead times are shorter. Because you may not actually have a margin problem. Maybe you actually have quite a bit of margin, free margin, but you have this cashflow problem, where you can't fund new batches of products because it takes six months to turn that product into revenue. So you could take some of the margin, you could do a trade off where you earn less profit per unit, but you're taking less of a risk up front. That's kind of the general learnings that I've had around how to do hardware financing.

- Great, thank you very much, Eric.

- Cool, thank you.
