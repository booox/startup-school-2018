# How to Get Meetings with Investors and Raise Money by Aaron Harris


Aaron Harris: Hi everyone. Thank you for having me. I'm gonna do more than just talk about  investor meetings. I also want to talk about who the investors are that you're gonna  be raising money from maybe one day, and what motivates them, because in order to  have a good meeting, you need to know what you're doing and how to achieve  that goal. When we think about investor meetings, there's a question of when you need  them, who you need them with, how to actually get the meetings, and actually how  to do the meetings. This might seem weird, but a meeting isn't just walking into  a room and sitting across the table from someone staring into each other's eyes. You  need to actually talk, you need to make points, and you need to know what  points to make. Kirsty just ran you through the mechanics of what fundraising actually means,  but in order to actually get the money from somebody, you usually have to know  who they are, track them down, find them, convince them to meet with you, convince  them to give you money, and then get the money in the bank. There's a  lot of steps that come up ahead of time. This talk is kind of your  magical plan to automatically raise money. If you follow these tips, no one will ever  say no to you. If they do, it's your fault. All right, so the first  thing is figuring out when you actually need to raise money, right. Not every business  needs money. Mailchimp famously has never raised a dollar in outside financing and is worth  billions of dollars. So before you think about whether or not you ... Or, before  you think about meeting with investors to raise money, you first need to answer the  question of if you actually need to raise money. There's a bunch of different steps  in this. You can raise money when you're just at the idea stage. You can  raise money if you just have a prototype. You can raise money when you have  users. In fact, it gets easier and easier as you have each of these things,  because they're demonstrations of progress. But you need money when you actually need it to  grow your business, and figuring out whether or not you need money to grow your  business is a very particular decision about your company. If you think about this, think  about raising money as a continuum, right. If you have nothing, and no understanding of  how you would spend money if you had it, don't try to raise money. It's  a waste of time. Instead, focus on building your product and building your company. If  you get a little further along, you have your idea or your prototype, you start  to see oh, if I actually had a little more money I'd be able to  do X, Y, and Z, which would make me go faster. Now flip yourself into  the mind of the investor and think about, okay, well if I'm an investor, why  am I giving this person money? I have to have a reason, right, and the  reason is because I expect it to be very very very large one day. I  also expect them to be able to use this money appropriately. There are some uses  that are good for money and some uses that I would say are bad. The  first thing people always say about why they need to raise money is they need  to hire employees. This is very attractive because companies love to talk about how many  employees they have. It's a great metric when you don't have revenue or actual progress,  but the truth is, because you are building startups which hopefully leverage software, you need  to hire far fewer people than you think you do. In fact, hiring is the  single best way to kill your company if you don't need to do it, because  people cost money. If you are already hiring, you already need money whether or not  your idea's any good, whether or not your idea is growing. Think very carefully about  whether or not the blocker between you and the next step of growth is actually  hiring. The next thing people love to say is, well we need to do user  acquisition. We need to spend money on Google ads. This is usually a very bad  way to grow your business, especially early. You start spending money on Google ads and  you start looking at your user numbers and say, "Look, our user numbers are growing  up so we need to pour more money into it." What many people don't think,  especially if it's their first startup, is whether or not they're acquiring people profitably, customers  profitably, and whether or not they're doing that profitably on a timeline that allows them  to recycle capital and keep growing. Before you start spending money on user acquisition, it  probably makes sense to start acquiring people for free. Get users who love your product  to tell their friends about how much they love the product, and then you get  them for free and you don't need to raise money. Then some of you will  need customer service. If your customers are getting angry because you're not doing enough to  make them happy, you're not answering their questions, that's actually a pretty good reason to  raise money and is actually one of the first limiting factors that a lot of  companies hit. The reason this is a good one is because you as founders will  be able to deal with customer service for quite a long time and you'll only  stop being able to do that when you have enough users and customers that you  get overwhelmed. What's interesting is that if someone's using a product that is free, their  expectation of customer service is much lower which means you can handle a lot more.  If they're paying you, your customer service level has to be higher, but you're making  more money, so you can afford to hire more people to do customer service before  you actually have to look for outside capital. Now part of the reason I'm saying  and warning so actively against fundraising before you're ready, is the earlier you raise money,  the more diluted that capital is. Right, people aren't going to give you a three  million dollar valuation, a five million dollar valuation, a ten million dollar valuation unless you  have something to show them. Every dollar raised is more of your equity in your  eventual multi-billion dollar business that you're giving away. You don't want to do that if  you don't have to. Let's talk a little bit about the types of investors in  your neighborhood. First, we have friends and family. Then, there are accelerators, there are angels,  there are seed funds, there are VC funds, and there's crowd funding. There are so  many different ways to raise money and so many different places from which to raise  it, but the important thing in figuring out who these investors are, how to get  meetings with them, and how to convince them that they should actually give you money,  is understanding a little bit about them, what motivates them, and how to get in  touch with them. First, let's talk about accelerators. Accelerators are basically investors that have education  programs attached to them. YC is an accelerator. We take you in for three months,  we work with companies, we try to make them better and better and better and  better and better by teaching them what we know and helping them avoid mistakes, and  then we launch them out into the world on Demo Day, and give them a  community on the other side. Now, there are thousands of accelerators all over the world.  We see applications from all over the world and I think the number of accelerators  is proliferating faster than the number of startups. This terrifies me because most of the  people who are advising companies in accelerators have no idea what they're doing. They've never  worked at a startup, they've never started a startup, they've never funded a startup outside  of the accelerator. You've got to ask yourself why on Earth should I take advice  from this person who's never done any of the things that they're telling me I  should do, never seen any of these things work? Actually what you notice is most  accelerators actually hurt companies, so be very careful about going to an accelerator. None of  you need an accelerator to succeed as a company. If the accelerator is helpful, that's  great, but if not, it damages your company because of the word accelerate. If you  do an accelerator, come out the other side, and you're the same or worse than  you were when you started, it didn't accelerate you very well, did it? Every other  investor that looks at you will look at you and think, "Huh, that didn't work.  What's it actually going to take to accelerate this company? It's probably not money, there  must be something wrong with the founders." And it might not be you, it might  have been the accelerator that hurt you, so be careful and think very carefully and  look at the track record that those accelerators have. Next up, friends and family. This  is probably the most common source of funding for early stage startups at the earliest,  earliest stages. Friends and family are moms, dads, rich uncles, Grammy and Pop Pop, people  who have hopefully a little bit of extra money that they can give you because  it feels good. Let's be honest, your friends and family don't usually think you're going  to build the next Google, right? They love you, they remember when you were in  diapers, and they're basically giving you money because you have conviction that you can do  something and they want to support you and be nice. Don't take advantage of that  niceness. Only take money from friends and family if you know that they can afford  to lose every single dollar that they give you, because let's be honest, you're probably  gonna lose every single dollar they give you. Let that sink in. Most startups that  raise venture capital do not produce a return. Be very thoughtful about whether or not  you take money from friends and family, and don't make the terms really really onerous.  Don't raise 50 thousand dollars from your grandma at a 50 million dollar valuation. That  doesn't make any sense. You're probably gonna get the inheritance anyway, so it just doesn't  work. But seriously, if you artificially set a very high price at this point in  your life, you can probably set the price because again, they're being nice, but that  makes every other fundraising you do increasingly difficult because the price is so high. When  you do want money from a friend or family member, treat it like a real  meeting. Treat them as if they're real investors. Be respectful of their time. Go in  with an actual pitch and an actual understanding of what you're doing, not just, "Can  you please give me money now? Thank you." Don't do that. Really treat this as  an important thing because it will help train you for the next stage of raising  money, which is usually angels. Angels are basically rich people with a little too much  time and money on their hands. They invest mostly as a sport, right. Have you  ever noticed on Twitter, angels will often say, "Oh, my billion dollar company this, my  billion dollar company that." It's basically trophy hunting. You have no idea how much money  they invested in those companies or whether or not they actually made money, or whether  or not the money that they made is meaningful to them. But, they really like  to invest in new companies, and there's actually a lot of reasons. It's actually not  just about trophy hunting. There's a lot of angels who invest because they really want  to see new technologies exist, or because when they were new founders, someone gave them  a chance and they want to pay it forward. Angels are usually pretty easy to  get in front of because they, well professional angels are easy to get in front  of. All they want to do is invest in exciting, new, interesting companies and spend  time with founders who make them feel interested and who teach them things. Email them,  and if they seem really, really busy, you can usually network to them pretty quickly,  especially if they're local. Whatever city you're in pretty much around the world, has at  least a few angels. The one last thing I would say about angels is that  you should be careful of angel groups. I forget what they're called, but there are  basically these groups of angels that like to get together for meals and grill new  founders and then not invest. It's this sport of ripping people apart because they are  successful investors or something, and they just want to show you how good they are.  Before you take money from, or before you go chase an angel down, do some  research ahead of time to figure out whether or not they actively invest. That's the  signal. Have they made an investment in the last six months, twelve months, five years,  ten years? If they haven't made an investment in a year or two, they're probably  not investing actively, so it's probably not a good idea to waste your time chasing  them down. Next up the capital stack is seed funds. Seed funds are kind of  super professional angels who have raised some amount of outside capital that they are investing.  They're usually investing on behalf of angels who maybe don't have enough money to be  LPs in really big funds. These are usually newer but professional investors who are trying  to learn the ropes. They're often great, they're often recent founders, they're probably pretty aggressive  about finding good deals. They have quick processes because they know they have to move  quickly. Do research on them. Their whole job is to meet new founders who they  want to talk to and invest in. Email them, cold emails to these people are  fine. If you can get a warm email, great, but you should just reach out  to seed funds. Their entire job is meeting with you to see if they can  invest in you. Remember, that they are investing for a return so that they can  raise their next fund, so they're not interested in things that are just gonna produce  a small return. They're not interested in lifestyle businesses, which an angel might be interested  in investing in if there's cash flow. They need you to return capital. Then there's  the VC funds. These are obviously the big deal in fundraising. VC funds run the  gamut. There are VC funds that invest million dollar checks and there are VC funds  that invest billion dollar checks. Know what you need for your stage of capital. They  all have, or almost all have multiple LPs which are limited partners who give them  money and say, "Hey, we need you to produce x percent return on an annual  basis." It's called an IRR target. These people, these LPs, are looking across all the  venture funds in the world and saying, "Where can I allocate money?" Then they're looking  at all of the different alternative asset managers and saying, "Where can I allocate money?"  Then they're looking across all of investible assets and saying, "Where can I allocate money?"  If I'm a VC partner, if I'm a GP, I have to think not only  do I have to be one of the better VCs, I have to return more  at a better risk than anything else this investor could put money into, for me  to get that LP capital. When they're looking at you, they don't just need you  to return five or ten x, they're looking at every single investment and saying, "Will  this investment return my entire fund?" As you're thinking about how to meet with these  people, you got to think about, "Oh shoot, when I walk into that meeting, I  can't just pitch a small vision of what I'm doing. I gotta do something big  here." Now VCs when they invest usually have a pretty specific structure of what they  do and how they make decisions. You might meet with a partner at first and  then two partners and five partners, and then the whole general partnership if you're raising  something like a series A. But the earlier stages, most of the biggest VC funds  can make a decision off a meeting with one single partner. If you're all thinking  about sort of that first check, probably don't even think about these guys. This comes  later in the process when you're ready to raise a lot of money. The last  kind of investor that I can think of is crowd funding websites. These are a  little bit of a strange thing to think about when it comes to say a  meeting or getting in front of them, because they split. There's crowd funding that can  be done via syndicate, where there's one person who's kind of like an angel who  has a bunch of money from other people to say, "Hey, we're gonna invest in  this thing." And then everyone follows them along. They work kind of like professional investors  do, where you'll meet with them, talk to them, then they'll say, "Hey. We're gonna  back you. Can we put you on?" There's private syndicates and public syndicates. You do  not have to meet with every member of a syndicate in order to raise money  on a crowd funding site. There's also the option on many crowd funding sites to  simply list your company, subject to a few checks to make sure you're not committing  fraud, where they'll just put you up and then people will send money your way  without you ever meeting anyone. This is a good way to raise money if you  can't figure out another way to do it, or there's no investors near you, or  you don't want to be bothered with the time. It's usually not a good way  to raise lots and lots and lots of money because one, it's usually not there  and two, if you have all these individual tiny little investors on your cap table,  they become a nightmare to manage. Think carefully about this option and think about what  it will do for you and what it can do to you. A couple of  these investors, as I mentioned, are susceptible or open to receiving cold emails. Actually, every  one is receptive to cold emails. I think I respond to pretty much every cold  email I get, if I can, but, there's good ones and bad ones. Here's a  bad cold email. "Dear Sir or Madam, I have noticed in my research on the  internet that you are an investor in technology companies. I'd like to introduce you to  an opportunity to make money in this new and exciting field. May I come to  your office for an hour to present you with this opportunity? Sincerely, Aaron." I would  not take a meeting with this person. I have no idea what they do, they  don't seem to have done any work to understand what I'm interested in, who I  am, what I've done in the past, and they're asking for an hour of my  time in person. That's a lot of time. Remember that professional investors, sure, they meet  with people all day long, but the only thing that limits them is their time.  They want to give that to the people who matter most. How do you think  about sending a good cold email? The answer is by doing research. Most investors are  very happy to tweet about things that interest them, companies they've invested in. They write  blogs about ideas that they have and companies that they want to see exist. They  have prolific profiles online based on the companies that they've started in the past. You  should go and research every single investor that you want to talk to and figure  out a way to get in front of them with a custom introduction that is  relevant to them and to you. Here's one you could send to Adora. "Adora, I'm  building a marketplace for home cleaners. I have a novel approach to this. All of  the cleaners are robots. We've launched and are just starting to grow." So let's stop  for a second, if you've done research on Adora, you know that she built a  marketplace for home services, so you know that this is relevant to her. You also  might know she thinks robots are cool, so that's another good hook. You tell her  the stage that you're at, launched and are just starting to grow. Now, launched is  great because it proves that you're actually doing things. Starting to grow is intriguing because  it makes me want to ask how much are you starting to grow? How fast?  How are you measuring growth? How do these things work? Then, "I think you'd be  a great investor for us because of your experience with Homejoy. I think we've solved  unit economics and reliability. Can we discuss this for 15 minutes? Happy to email if  that's better for you. Sincerely, Aaron." Let's think of all the different things here that  are good. You've only asked for 15 minutes of time, that's easy and can be  done by the phone. You also offered to do it over email if Adora happens  to be busy or is traveling, she can just deal with the first set of  questions over email. I love to do this, I always go to email first and  if someone really gives good email responses and is thoughtful and asks good questions, I'm  much more inclined to meet them and be happy when I'm meeting them, walk into  the meeting with a positive understanding of what they're doing and context to understand the  entire conversation. Right, that's a prepared mind for what you're thinking of doing. You reference  her past with Homejoy and you'll know if you watch some of Adora's lectures and  videos online that she thinks a lot about unit economics and reliability, so you know  that these things are important and you're saying we've solved these two key critical issues  that are important to you. This is a slam dunk. This is a cold email  that is likely to get a response, whether or not you know the person you're  emailing, because it's so specific. It's the same thing by the way, if you are  sending lots of emails to people you don't necessarily know to try to convince them  to use your service. There's a big difference between spamming people and sending them a  relevant email about a relevant service that they will find interesting. Don't spam investors, it  doesn't work. They're immune to it. Investors are not usually sitting around waiting for an  email from someone they've never met introducing them to an investment opportunity. What they are  waiting for is the company that no one else knows that is secretly amazing, that  nobody else has talked to yet, that has no connections. That is the company that  if you find it, and is actually as good as it seems, that's the one  that makes you all of the money. An investor who gets a cold email this  good, is already starting to think, "Oh crap. This is my Google and no one  else knows about it. I better move fast, meet them, figure out what's going on,  give them a bunch of money, and then help them IPO." That's the response you  want to get out of someone. In fact, that's what you want to walk out  of every meeting with, an investor who's excited to move on to the next steps.  As you move through meetings with investors, there are a whole bunch of different meeting  types that you'll have to navigate, and different investors do different kinds of these meetings.  Let me list them and then I'll walk through a little bit more about what  they are. First up, there's the intro meeting. All investors do intro meetings except the  crowd funding sites. Then, there's a follow up meeting. Pretty much all investors do this  except some angels who might decide to invest in you after that first meeting. Then  you've got the decision meeting. This is really only professional investors. This will be a  meeting with multiple partners or with that one partner, but to really dig in and  make sure that they want to do the deal. After, well depending on how competitive  your fundraise is, which is a whole other set of things, there's diligence. A diligence  meeting might be with you, might be with your team, might be with your lawyer.  Sometimes it's handled by the VC themselves or the investor themselves and sometimes it's handled  by someone on their team. Then finally, if it all goes according to plan, you  get fancy dinners. Fancy dinners are the goal. Not raising money for your company, getting  to eat for free. Different investors will use fancy dinners differently. Sometimes it's used to  sell you on an offer that they've made where they really want to get to  know you better and show you how great they are, and then usually after everything's  done, you can finagle a closing dinner out of someone. In all serious though, the  reason that I put this on here is that every investor that you take onto  your cap table is going to be with you for the life of your company.  You need to make sure that the people you're taking money from aren't jerks. If  you can't sit through an hour dinner with someone, you should think very carefully about  whether or not you want to take their money. This is a little less relevant  at very early stages with small check sizes from angels, but anyone who's giving you  a material amount of money, you need to think very carefully about whether or not  you want them there. All right. What you need for each of these meetings changes.  The intro meeting is really simple. All you really need is a clear explanation of  your idea. That's actually the base level of everything, a super clear ... This is  the elevator pitch, right? The reason this is important is because research shows that people  make decisions about what they want to do in an interview sometimes in the first  30 seconds of a meeting. You can't necessarily get to 'yes' in 30 seconds, but  you can often get to 'no'. If someone comes in and cannot explain what they  do, that's a really bad sign. Make sure you really understand what it is that  you want to say and how you want to explain it. If you have a  demo of what you've built, that's awesome. Investors love to engage with real products and  see, and not only do they want to see that because they love playing with  things, this is evidence that you are doing the things that you are saying you're  gonna do. The entire purpose of meeting with investors is to show them that you  are inevitably going to be gigantic and progress is critical to that. I would also  recommend having a reasonably clean shirt. Doesn't have to be spotless, I understand what it's  like to be a founder, but don't show up looking like you just rolled out  of bed all rumpled. You can get away with that sometimes, but again, people unfortunately  judge based on first impressions. If you walk into the room looking like you don't  give a crap about the meeting, the investor isn't gonna give a crap about the  meeting. If you get past the intro, you're gonna get to a follow up meeting.  Again, except for the angels that invest off the first meeting. Follow ups start to  dig a little more deeply into your business. You need to understand your metrics. Now  in some cases, this will be the metrics that your business already has, and in  other cases, it'll be the metrics that your company will have in the future. If  you're building a consumer business, but you haven't launched yet, you need to have a  framework for understanding that monthly actives are important to you, or weeklies or dailies or  hourly actives are important to you. Talk about how you're thinking about those things and  how you're gonna focus on them. You need to be able to explain your progress  up to now, and remember that progress isn't an absolute value. Progress is a slope.  How long have you been working on what you've been working on and how far  have you gotten in that time? If you've been working on something for five years  and have yet to launch, not great. If you've been working on it for a  month and have a prototype ready, that's amazing. It's all relative. You want to be  able to dig a little more deeply on your insights into why you're doing what  you're doing than you did in that first introduction meeting. Remember that that introduction meeting  can be 15 minutes. It could be an hour, but it's probably pretty short, so  this is your chance to show just how much you understand about what you're doing.  When you get to an actual decision meeting, this is really when you need the  deck. Again, this is mostly for professional investors. Most angels don't need to see a  deck. It's not really that relevant. I kind of think that some people spend more  time on their deck than they do working on product, which is usually a bad  trade because customers don't generally buy decks. Some do, but that's just weird. You need  to have your deck, and the deck doesn't have to be long. Actually, the simpler  the deck, the better. This deck is really really long that I'm running through today.  If you're a seed company, eight slides, maybe ten. Your opportunity, your team, what you're  gonna build or what you've already built, and your early metrics. That's it. I actually  put up a sample slide deck on the YC blog, go check it out. It's  really short. You can actually just use that deck and replace your name with the  Deck Company, I think is what it's called. At this point, if you have metrics,  you need to know them cold. If someone asks you what six month or twelve  month retention is, know it off the top of your head, don't have to pull  up your computer and look for it. Obviously there are levels and layers of metrics  underneath that you don't need, but any top level metric that's important, know that, and  for your most important metrics, be able to dig in a couple layers. The critical  part of a decision meeting, and again this is because this is for professional investors,  is that you need to take where you are now and project what the biggest  future actually is. I remember when I sat down and pitched Sequoia for my decision  meeting, it was me and five partners in the room. The thing that they really  dug in on was what my company could be in ten or fifteen years, and  that was all they cared about at that point. They were already sold on the  basics of the business at that point. They were sold mostly on me, but the  thing that they wanted to understand I think, is how I thought about the future  and whether or not they thought I could actually do that thing. Could we become  a globe spanning company? Because again, that's the only thing they care about, and your  ability to dig into that and explain it is the difference between whether or not  you're just another company, or something with huge vision that they think you can achieve.  After that comes the diligence meetings. These meetings aren't usually that hard on you if  you've done your homework ahead of time, and again, this is later. The earlier in  your life as a company, the less diligence you have. Make sure you have your  legal docs in order, make sure your financials if you have them, make sense. We've  seen some really insane things come up during diligence where a company has 50 percent  less cash than they thought they did. Don't do that. It's usually some other problems  at work if that happens. Have a metrics dashboard. Again, if you have the metrics,  be able to bring up your full dashboard so that people can really dig way  down into everything that you're doing. If you walk through all of those things, if  you understand the framework for your meetings, you'll get to the final step, which is  that fancy dinner. There is food and you'll need another reasonably clean shirt, but this  is the end and doesn't even necessarily happen. Honestly, even if it doesn't, the thing  that you are trying to get to is actually money in the bank. Whether or  not an investor takes you out for a meal or an investor seems fancy or  other people think the investor is cool, none of that matters. At the end of  the day, the thing that you need as a company, if you need money to  grow, is just money. Honestly, all of these meetings are irrelevant if you can get  that money without them. Never put yourself in a position where an investor that you  have researched is great, you know they're great, they email you and say, "Hey, I'm  traveling this month but I really want to invest. Can I send you a quarter  of a million dollars and we'll catch up afterwards?" Don't say no because you haven't  met for coffee. I'd recommend getting on the phone with them and chatting with them  and trying to do your own diligence. Check references, but don't turn people down just  because they haven't fit into whatever we believe or you believe is the perfect process.  A few things to remember about meetings, about investors. Most importantly, meetings do not equal  progress. I run into so many founders who tell me all about all of the  different meetings that they're having and how they met with this person and that person  and that famous person. It's irrelevant. The only thing that matters is building a big  company, and if you are meeting with investors when you don't need to raise money,  you are taking your time and focus away from the thing that matters, which is  building the big company. Only start meeting with investors when you know that you need  money. When you are in a fundraising process, the only thing that counts as a  'Yes, I will invest' is "Yes, I will invest", signed documents and wired money. Investors  hate saying no because every time they say no, they close off the opportunity to  invest in something that's going to make them a lot of money and they risk  looking stupid for having said no. They will do everything they can not to. What  I've actually found is the best investors are the ones who will say no fastest.  Not say yes fastest, who will say no fastest, because they're the ones who understand  what it is they're looking for and how to make decisions quickly. If you find  yourself in a situation and you're going out and meeting after meeting after meeting after  meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting, nothing takes that long. This is  a gamble, and at some point, someone has to make a decision, and indecisive investors  usually don't make good decisions. When you're meeting with people, push to a close. The  final piece is a warning for you to watch out for. I hate having to  talk about these things because I wish they didn't happen, but they do. The first  piece of bad behavior is what I just mentioned, investors who just waste your time.  This is honestly kind of harmless, but just watch out for it. The next thing  is investors who are jerks. This takes lots of different forms. There are investors who  will try to impress you with how much money they have, who will try to  impress you with the people they know, who will talk down to you because you're  new and they're old. There are investors who will try to make you feel as  if your idea is stupid without giving you any help or understanding of where their  thought process is coming from. Don't take it. If someone's a jerk, leave or say,  "Hey, you're being an asshole. I have a lot of people that I can talk  to and I'd rather not talk to you. Thanks." Don't be a jerk yourself, but  be honest, be forthright, and leave a meeting if you have to if someone's being  a jerk. Don't take another meeting with them and then tell your friends that this  person was a jerk to you. This behavior corrects itself pretty quickly. Now sometimes, people  are being jerks without realizing it. They just think that's what they're supposed to do  or they're not so good in social interactions. Try giving feedback if that happens, and  see what happens. There are investors who will meet with you just to do diligence  on you for one of their portfolio companies. This is usually pretty obvious because they'll  just ask you question after question after question after question about process and metrics and  who your suppliers are and who your special relationships are and what are their phone  numbers and when can they go see them and can they introduce you to someone  else who seems to be working on a competitive product, but no, don't worry, it's  not really a competitive product. Oh wait, wait a second. Before you meet with someone,  just check to see if they are already invested in competitors and talk to them  about it ahead of time. For a lot of investors, they explicitly say we're happy  to invest in competitors over time and we compartmentalize information. Actually, YC does this. We  are happy to invest in competitors. We sometimes do it in the same batch. We  tell both companies we're doing it, but we'll do it in the same batch and  we'll do it across batches. We've developed a system whereby we're very careful about what  information can or would be shared, and keeping that trust sacred is something that we  are very serious about. The last thing and this has importantly become an issue, is  harassment. This could be sexual harassment, it could be racism, it could be any kind  of bigotry. Unfortunately, wealth has absolutely no relationship to morality, and investors, some of them  are not good people. I'll say most of the investors that I interact with regularly  are great, but there are some bad apples and we just released a report this  week talking about just how many YC founders have experienced sexual harassment and the numbers  were way higher than I would have possibly imagined. If you encounter anything like this,  this is absolutely grounds to walk right out. No one should ever be allowed to  make you feel as if you have to do anything for them to get their  money other than build a big company. No one should ever be allowed to violate  your personal space or make you feel uncomfortable. If it happens, walk away and tell  us. We are starting to get better at dealing with this, and we would much  prefer a situation in which no investor meeting ever goes in a way where someone  ends up feeling uncomfortable. That's how to think about investor meetings, how to think about  when you need them, how to get them, who to do them with, and how  to do them. I really think that if you follow these steps, everything will always  go perfectly for you, at least I hope it does. Thank you all so much  and I think we have time for questions. Yeah.

Speaker 2: So it is wise to go approach a VC that's already invested in a competitor?

Aaron Harris: Is it wise to approach a VC who is already invested in a competitor? It's  incredibly case-dependent. If they invested in a competitor ten years ago and that company is  public, they might actually be a perfect investor for you because they know the play  book and they'll help you IPO. But you need to just look at the specific  situation and decide whether or not it makes sense.

Speaker 3: Between the seed, angels, and micro VCs, what is better to manage [inaudible] . There's  a lot of information on the web, but [inaudible] .

Aaron Harris: Between the seed funds, the angel funds, and the micro VCs ... I didn't even  talk about micro VCs, I'm never sure what they are. What's the average check size  and round size? It's dependent not just on ... There's so many variables. The investors,  the market, the geography, the company and what it needs. I mean, there are seed  rounds that get done for 50 thousand dollars and seed rounds that get done for  10 million dollars, so it's really dependent. I think the way to think about it  is more what do I need? Smaller funds and angels are most likely to write  small checks, somewhere between I don't know, 10 and 100 thousand dollars and larger funds  are beyond that.

Speaker 4: It's pretty easy to figure out which VCs are credible, but how do you figure  out which angels are?

Aaron Harris: How do you figure out which angels are credible? Ask them for references. Look at  their portfolios. AngelList usually, if someone's an active angel, AngelList usually records what they do  and what they've invested in. Again, angels who are really active tend to talk about  it a lot, not for a bad reason actually, by talking about it that's how  they get deal flow. If you know someone's an active angel, you're gonna approach them,  so you should be able to do some amount of diligence. Obviously, this is harder  in emerging markets where there isn't as large of an investor ecosystem, but you just  have to do the footwork to figure it out.

Speaker 5: Can you talk about the mechanics of investor FOMO?

Aaron Harris: Can I talk about the mechanics of investor FOMO, or fear of missing out? That  would be a whole hour's worth of conversation. The basic idea though, is investors want  to invest in the largest companies they possibly can, and get as much ownership as  they possibly can. But at the early stages of a startup, there's very little data  to say whether or not this company is likely to succeed. Investors are always looking  for other pieces of confirmatory data, essentially. One of the most powerful pieces of that  data set is whether or not other smart people seem to think this is a  good idea. The reason FOMO exists is because if you see other smart investors getting  in on something, you infer that that company is good and likely to be big,  and you don't want to miss out on that. That's why a lot of investors  sit back and wait for someone else to make the move. I think those are  generally the less good investors. Again, the best investors really are the ones who make  their own decisions faster than anyone else, and actually, the best investors are the ones  who have incredibly fast diligence processes so they are the ones way out ahead of  everyone. You can still pressure them a little bit by having other investors lined up  behind, so they know that they have to move quickly, but that's the shortest possible  answer I could give you on it.

Speaker 6: Do you see founders making any common mistakes when they're communicating their vision to investors?

Aaron Harris: Mistakes that founders often make while communicating vision. Some go too big in a way  that makes them seem scattered, so if I were to pitch you on a company  that is well, we're a search engine. We also have self-driving cars, we make phones,  speakers, we built this crazy balloon that beams the internet down. Ooh, we have ads,  and display ads, and artificial intelligence and ooh, a whole department that just works on  crazy ideas. You'd say, "Oh, well this is a lot, even for me." That's kind  of going too big, it'll make you seem scattered. On the other side, sometimes people  go too small and they say, "Well, we're gonna conquer ten percent of our market  that's worth 50 million dollars and we're getting 100 percent of it. Okay, then what?  There has to be a there there that isn't too wild. Those I think are  sort of the two extremes to think about.

Speaker 7: Within family and friends, after that family or friend member meets the criteria and can  afford to lose that money, any other advice you'd give in terms of taking it  seriously and going in the right order with family and friends who after that criteria  is the next thing to look at?

Aaron Harris: How do you pitch family and friends who can afford to lose money? No, I  think that's very dependent on your relationship with those friends and family. If I wanted  Jeff to give me money, I'd camp out outside of his house and show up  every morning with donuts and coffee. I think that would get to him pretty well.  No but seriously, I think it really depends on who it is. I'd recommend working  on an elevator pitch, maybe even a deck, just for practice. That's the friendliest audience  you're ever going to get. Now this is different by the way, if your friends  and family happen to be incredibly successful founders who know what they're doing or are  venture investors. Then you can use them as real practice and say, "Hey, here's how  I'm planning on building my business. You built a business. Does this make sense?" Ask  for advice as much as you're asking for money in that case, and really just  treat it like a professional interaction.

Speaker 7: Thanks.

Speaker 8: Do we have to drop everything that we're doing to do fundraising? If so, how  long?

Aaron Harris: Do we have to drop everything we're doing for fundraising, and if so, how long?  Pretty much, yes. You're either fundraising or you're working on your company, which is why  you shouldn't try to fundraise unless you need it. And for how long is however  long it takes.

Speaker 8: Like how much?

Aaron Harris: I mean-

Speaker 8: Should you be prepared to take ten months or should you [inaudible] more?

Aaron Harris: I mean, you should be prepared to take six months, a year. I mean, it  really depends. Now if you are a very early stage company and it's taking you  a year to fundraise and you're not working on your product for a year, that's  probably pretty bad. That means you're not making any progress. I wouldn't do that, but  again, this is the question of figuring out whether or not you really need money.  If you're just starting out, you try to raise money for I don't know, a  month or two and no one's giving you money, I'd say try to figure out  how to grow without raising anything, and then come back later.

Speaker 9: Some VCs I work with only fund person, women founders, what do you think of  that?

Aaron Harris: Sorry, some investors only fund women founders, what do I think of that?

Speaker 9: [inaudible] . Only person, women founders.

Aaron Harris: I think that's great. The way that I think about fundraising and company building in  general is press every unfair advantage that you have. This is a corrective narrative where  there's investors who are specifically trying to fund female founders because investors have been pretty  bad at that in the past, and if you can use that to your advantage,  you absolutely should. I think it's great.

Speaker 11: We are good for one more.

Aaron Harris: One more?

Speaker 10: Should all founders be included in the fundraising process? Should you say that one specific  founder should be focused on that?

Aaron Harris: Should all founders be focused on the fundraising process? No. This is the CEO's job.  If you are lucky enough to have co-founders who can do other things, have them  do other things. Again, that will help you not completely stop progress on the business  while you're fundraising. If you can, you want to keep pushing the business forward while  the CEO goes and fund raises. With the professional investors, the venture investors for larger  later rounds, they're eventually going to want to meet the entire team, but they don't  need it at the beginning. In fact, you shouldn't bring the entire team to meetings  for the following reason. If you are in an investor meeting and someone makes you  an offer, if the entire team is there, you have to make a decision on  the spot. But you're in a severe disadvantage there because professional investors professionally negotiate and  make offers. You've probably never done this before. If the rest of your team is  back home, you can say, "Thank you so much for that offer. It's really interesting.  I need to talk about it with my co-founders." And then you can go back  and talk to your co-founders and buy yourself some time to really think through the  pluses and minuses. Thank you all.
