# A Conversation with Elad Gil

#与Elad Gil的谈话

Geoff Ralston: Okay.

杰夫·拉斯顿：好的。

The AC's on. We're good. Good morning everyone.
Speaker 2:

空调开着。我们很好。大家早上好。发言者2：

Geoff Ralston: I am very happy to have my friend, Elad Gil, here. You saw, some of you, or all of you if you looked online, a talk yesterday about how to get meetings with investors and raise money.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我很高兴有我的朋友埃尔德·吉尔在这里。你看到了，你们中的一些人，或者你们所有人-如果你们在网上看的话-昨天有一次关于如何与投资者会面和筹集资金的演讲。

If you would be so lucky as to get a meeting with this investor, and even more lucky to raise money from him, that would be a really good thing for your company. Elad's sort of an epic investor. He's had an epic career investing, but he's much more than that. He's not only a fantastic investor who's invested in a lot of YC companies, it seems like all the successful ones. Someday you have to tell me how you figured out how to do that. Maybe we can talk about that today. He's also a startup founder. He's worked at Google and Twitter, and he is increasingly known as an author. Claims it's not his career, but he is an author of High Growth Handbook, which is a very cool book.

如果你有幸与这位投资者会面，更幸运地从他那里筹到钱，那对你的公司来说将是一件非常好的事情。伊拉德是个史诗般的投资者。他有着史诗般的职业生涯投资，但他远不止这些。他不仅是一位出色的投资者，投资了很多YC公司，而且似乎是所有成功的公司。总有一天你得告诉我你是怎么知道怎么做的。也许我们今天可以谈谈这个。他也是初创公司的创始人。他曾在谷歌(Google)和推特(Twitter)工作，作为一名作家，他越来越出名。他声称这不是他的职业生涯，但他是“高增长手册”的作者，这本书很酷。

I recommend you all read it, but not maybe right while you're starting your startup. Maybe as your startup gets going, because a lot of the topics in there will be relevant for you hopefully in the future. Maybe you can start off the conversation by telling us a little bit about how you got to where you are today. What's your journey to epic investor, and startup founder, and, I guess, company whisperer?

我建议你们都读一读，但在你创业的时候，也许不是正确的。也许，当你的创业开始，因为其中的许多主题将与你有关，希望在未来。也许你可以先告诉我们你是如何到达今天的状态的。你对史诗般的投资者，初创公司的创始人，我想，公司的窃窃私语有何感想？

Elad Gil: Sure. First of all, thanks for having me here.

Elad Gil：当然。首先，谢谢你让我来这里。

I'm really excited to be here for Startup School.

我真的很兴奋能来这里参加创业学校。

I moved out here right after graduate school.

我刚毕业就搬过来了。

I moved out.

我搬出去了。

I didn't know anybody. Many of my friends decided to stay on the East Coast, and so I was sort of starting fresh when I first came out here.

我谁都不认识。我的许多朋友决定留在东海岸，所以当我第一次来到这里的时候，我开始有点新鲜了。

I had terrible market timing in that I moved out here right as the entire internet bubble was collapsing.

我有一个糟糕的市场时机，我搬到这里，因为整个互联网泡沫正在崩溃。

I went into an environment where, a year after I got here, most people were getting laid off, and most people were sort of desperately looking for jobs. So, somebody who was a vice president of product management was suddenly trying to get any product manager job they could get at any level at any company.

我进入了一个环境，在我来到这里一年后，大多数人都被解雇了，大多数人都在拼命地找工作。因此，一位负责产品管理的副总裁突然试图在任何一家公司找到他们能得到的任何一份产品经理的工作。

It was a very odd environment, and it was a very tough one to plug into.

这是一个非常奇怪的环境，也是一个很难融入的环境。

This is before things like YC existed.

这是在YC这样的东西存在之前。

There was no online content around starting companies.

在创办公司时，没有在线内容。

There was no content about basically doing anything, and so what you had to do is really sort of hand-to-hand combat in terms of networking, meeting people.

基本上没有做任何事情的内容，所以你所要做的就是在人际关系、与人见面方面进行一场手拉手的战斗。

I basically talked my way into a job by offering to work for free at a startup.

我基本上是通过在一家初创公司免费工作的方式来获得一份工作的。

That was my entrée.

那是我的主顾。

It was basically an unpaid laborer on behalf of a company as a way to get my foot in the door and get my foot into technology.

它基本上是一个无报酬的工人代表一个公司，作为一种方式，让我的脚到门口，让我的脚进入技术。

That was basically my starting point.

这基本上是我的出发点。

Geoff Ralston: That's sort of a good lesson for how, even in today's world where there's many more resources, for how you have to ... You have to really pound the pavement.

杰夫·拉斯顿：这是一个很好的教训，即使在今天的世界里，那里有更多的资源，你必须如何.你得把人行道撞得粉碎。

It's elbow grease to get started lots of times, right?

很多次都是手肘油，对吧？

Elad Gil: Yeah, absolutely.

是的，当然。

I think what happened is after ...

我想发生的事情是在.。

I got a PhD in biology.

我获得了生物学博士学位。

It's completely irrelevant to software and technology, but I wanted to go into software and technology.

这与软件和技术完全无关，但我想研究一下软件和技术。

Geoff Ralston: Well, completely irrelevant at the time to software and technology.

杰夫·拉斯顿：嗯，当时与软件和技术完全无关。

Elad Gil: Completely irrelevant at the time.

Elad Gil：当时完全不相关。

Geoff Ralston: But it changed later, right?

杰夫·拉斯顿：但后来改变了，对吧？

Elad Gil: It's changed.

Elad Gil：它变了。

Geoff Ralston: We can talk [crosstalk]

杰夫·拉斯顿：我们可以谈谈[相声]。

Elad Gil: Basically, my first software startup job allowed me then to be a software person, and that was the thing that allowed me to do a transition.

Elad Gil：基本上，我的第一份软件创业工作让我成为了一名软件人，这就是允许我进行转型的原因。

I actually moved out here to join a telecom equipment startup as a product manager, so I worked on hardware.

实际上，我搬到这里是为了加入一家电信设备初创公司，担任产品经理，所以我从事硬件方面的工作。

I had to leave that company, and then I talked my way into working for free at a software company.

我不得不离开那家公司，然后我说服自己在一家软件公司免费工作。

Then, I was suddenly a software person, and that's what sort of led to me then eventually ending up at Google and other places.

然后，我突然成为了一个软件人，这就是导致我最终在谷歌和其他地方结束的原因。

Geoff Ralston: So, you ended up at Google, but let's talk a little bit about ... Because you ended up working at Google and Twitter. But you started companies in between, and in the end, sort of transitioned into becoming an investor. How did that all happen?

杰夫·拉斯顿：所以，你最后在谷歌，但让我们谈谈.因为你最后在谷歌和推特工作。但你在两者之间创办了一些公司，最终，你转变成了一名投资者。这一切是怎么发生的？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I joined Google in 2004 and effectively started the mobile team there. So, I helped iAndroid and pulled together early teams for Google Mobile Maps and Mobile Gmail, each of which have hundreds of millions of users, but I had nothing to do with that since I left before that massive growth.

我于2004年加入谷歌，并在那里有效地启动了移动团队。所以，我帮助iAndroid，为Google Mobile Maps和Mobile Gmail组建了早期团队，每个团队都有数亿用户，但自从我离开之前，我就没有做过任何事情。

I left Google to start a very early data infrastructure company that was called Mixer Labs, was the company name. GeoAPI was a product name.

我离开谷歌是为了创建一家非常早期的数据基础设施公司，名为MixerLabs，是该公司的名称。GeoAPI是一个产品名称。

That was acquired by Twitter, and Twitter bought us when Twitter was about 90 people.

这是由Twitter收购的，Twitter在Twitter大约90人的时候买下了我们。

Then, my job quickly became one of helping the company scale from 90 people to 1,500 people over two and a half years.

然后，我的工作很快就变成了帮助公司在两年半内从90人扩大到1500人的工作。

The prior sort of super-growth journey I had before that was I actually joined Google at around 1,500 to 2,000 people, and it hit 15,000 people over three and a half years. So, very rapid growth when something's actually working.

我之前经历过的那种超级增长之旅，实际上是我以1500到2000人的身份加入谷歌的，在三年半的时间里，我的人数达到了1.5万人。所以，当某件事真的起作用的时候，非常迅速的增长。

Then, I left Twitter to start another company called Color Genomics, which is a big-data-meets-genomics company that's raised about $150 million in venture capital and is up and running still here in Burlingame.

然后，我离开Twitter，创办了另一家名为“色彩基因组”的公司，这是一家大数据相遇基因组公司，该公司筹集了约1.5亿美元的风险资本，目前仍在伯林加梅运营。

Geoff Ralston: And finally made use of your PhD in biology, thankfully?

杰夫·拉斯顿：终于利用了你的生物学博士学位，谢天谢地？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: You're an interesting mix of big-company guy and small-company guy. How do you think of yourself? That's sort of unusual, isn't it?

杰夫·拉斯顿：你是一个有趣的大公司和小公司的人的混合体。你觉得自己怎么样？这有点不寻常，不是吗？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I guess I think of myself as somebody who is good at operating teams or driving efforts.

我想我认为自己是一个善于团队运作或努力工作的人。

It could be a five-person team, or it could be a multi-hundred person team.

它可以是一个五人团队，也可以是一个数百人的团队。

That's my self-actualization of what I do.

这就是我所做的事情的自我实现。

I actually think there's a lot of people who drop in and out of big companies and startups in terms of they start a company. Maybe it gets acquired.

实际上，我认为有很多人在大公司和初创公司的创办方面，会有很多人进来或离开。也许它会被获得。

They run a division.

他们管理着一个部门。

They maybe go and start another company, or they become an investor.

他们可能会去创办另一家公司，或者成为一名投资者。

If you look at Silicon Valley, it's sort of littered with people who've done this sort of back and forth. Ben Horowitz would be a good example of joined a company, which was Netscape.

如果你看看硅谷，就会发现到处都是做过这种事的人。本·霍洛维茨(BenHorowitz)将是加入网景公司的一个很好的例子。

It went public. He then started a company.

公开了。然后他创办了一家公司。

It got acquired by HP. Ran a big division at HP and then co-founded at Andreessen Horowitz. But that was a related career path in terms of somebody who bounced between the two.

它被惠普收购了。在惠普经营一个大部门，然后在安德森-霍洛维茨共同创建。但这是一个相关的职业道路的人谁之间反弹。

Geoff Ralston: It kind of puts the lie to the trope that you have to fire the entrepreneur ... You're either an entrepreneur, or you're a big company person. But it's not quite so simple, is it?

杰夫·拉斯顿：这就像是在说你必须解雇企业家的谎言.你要么是个企业家，要么是个大公司的人。但并不是很简单，对吧？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think it's a good point because I think there was a real shift when Mark Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg as COO and to people saying that founders can keep going. Because what happened in the '90s was founders were quickly replaced by professional CEOs if they raised any venture capital. Because often the venture capitalists would take over the board pretty quickly, often at the series A. What that meant is that founders were often demoted, and they'd bring in sort of that old, gray-haired person to run the thing.

我认为这是一个很好的观点，因为我认为当马克·扎克伯格聘请谢丽尔·桑德伯格担任首席运营官时，人们说创始人可以继续前进，这是一个真正的转变。因为90年代发生的事情是创始人，如果他们筹集到任何风险资本，他们很快就会被职业CEO所取代。因为风险资本家通常会很快接管董事会，通常是在A系列节目中。这意味着创始人往往会被降职，他们会带来一些年长的、头发灰白的人来管理这件事。

I think that really shifted in the era of Zuckerberg where suddenly people said, "Wow, you can build massive companies with the founder CEO still driving it." If you actually looked at the history of the biggest technology companies, that was always true.

我认为这在扎克伯格时代发生了真正的变化，当时人们突然间说：“哇，你可以在创始人CEO还在驾驶的情况下建立大公司。”如果你真的看了一下最大的科技公司的历史，那是真的。

Intel was always driven by its founders. Microsoft was always driven by its founders, at least early on, first 10, 20 years. Dell was driven by its founder. So, anecdotally, actually, founder CEOs work really well, especially if they're able to maintain control and not raise external capital, or if they raise it on very good terms where they didn't give up control. But the second they give up control in the '90s, they'd be out.

英特尔总是受到创始人的推动。微软总是受到创始人的推动，至少在最初的10到20年里是如此。戴尔是由其创始人驱动的。因此，实际上，创始人CEO们工作得很好，尤其是如果他们能够保持控制权而不筹集外部资本，或者如果他们在没有放弃控制权的情况下以非常好的条件筹集资金的话。但是当他们在90年代放弃控制的时候，他们就会出局。

Geoff Ralston: Like Steve Jobs.

杰夫·拉斯顿：就像史蒂夫·乔布斯。

Elad Gil: Steve Jobs.

Elad Gil：史蒂夫·乔布斯。

The founders of Yahoo didn't run the company.

雅虎的创始人并没有经营这家公司。

The founders of Ebay didn't run the company. You can go through all the major companies of the '90s.

eBay的创始人并没有经营这家公司。你可以通过所有90年代的大公司。

The founders of Google had Eric Schmidt come in. Up until the Zuck moment, I think, it wasn't a very common practice.

谷歌的创始人让埃里克·施密特进来。直到扎克时刻，我认为，这不是一个非常普遍的做法。

Geoff Ralston: Most of the folks here in Startup School are in very, very early-stage companies. Let's talk about what it's like in the early stage, if you can think back to Mixer Labs and even Color. How did you think ... You were the CEO of both those companies. How did you think about what should have most of your attention during that time?

杰夫·拉斯顿：创业学校里的大多数人都是在非常、非常早期的公司里工作的。让我们来谈谈早期的情况，如果你能回想一下混合实验室，甚至颜色。你觉得.。你是这两家公司的首席执行官。在这段时间里，你是如何思考什么才是你最关注的？

Elad Gil: I think the singular thing that really matters is product market fit, so building something the customers then want.

EladGil：我认为真正重要的是产品市场的适合性，所以建立一些客户想要的东西。

That's really honestly the only thing that truly, truly matters. Now, to get there it means you have to hire people, unless you can build it all yourself and sell it all yourself.

老实说，这是唯一真正重要的事情。现在，要做到这一点，就意味着你必须雇佣一些人，除非你可以自己动手建造，然后自己把它全部卖掉。

It means that you have to raise money if you can't fund it off of your customers, or if you can't just bootstrap it. But when all is said and done, you need to build and sell product.

这意味着，如果你不能从你的客户那里筹集资金，或者你不能仅仅引导它，你就必须筹集资金。但是，当一切都说了，做了，你需要建立和销售产品。

In the very early days, that's really the core thing. Yeah.

在早期，这才是真正的核心。嗯

Geoff Ralston: We've talked a lot about product market fit and finding product market fit in Startup School. One of the most common questions that everyone asks is how do you know when you have it? It's not so obvious, it seems.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我们在创业学校讨论过很多关于产品市场匹配和产品市场匹配的话题。每个人都问的最常见的问题之一是，你怎么知道什么时候有？似乎没那么明显。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think it's obvious if you think about it the right way, but I think it's very hard otherwise.

我认为如果你用正确的方式去思考，这是很明显的，但我认为这是非常困难的，否则。

I'll give you three examples of signs that you have product market fit from three different companies.

我会给你三个例子，表明你的产品市场适合于三家不同的公司。

If your product is broken, and people are still using it very actively, or you have high retention on a broken product, that's a clear sign of product market fit. When Twitter was constantly going down and the Fail Whale days, and yet nobody moved off of Twitter, that was a sign of just raw market adoption.

如果你的产品是坏的，而且人们仍然非常积极地使用它，或者你对一个破碎的产品有很高的保留能力，这是一个产品市场适合的明显标志。当Twitter不断下跌，失败鲸鱼时代，但没有人离开Twitter，这只是一个原始的市场采用迹象。

A second sign is if you're a SaaS company, and you have major brands finding and using you organically and paying for your product, that's a sign of product market fit. Examples of that would be PagerDuty, which had, I think, Apple as an early customer.

第二个标志是，如果你是一家SaaS公司，并且你有主要的品牌发现和使用你的产品，并且为你的产品付费，那就是产品市场适合的标志。这方面的例子就是PagerTask，我认为苹果是早期的客户。

There's Zeplin, which had, I think, Facebook using them very early.

还有Zeplin，我认为Facebook很早就开始使用它们了。

Airtable has all sorts of brands that have just sort of adopted it.

Airtable有各种各样的品牌刚刚采用了它。

I think there's a number of sort of more recent breakout e-companies where big brands are just showing up and starting to pay.

我认为最近出现了一些新的电子公司，大品牌刚刚出现并开始付费。

I think that's a clear sign of product market fit.

我认为这是一个明确的标志，产品市场适合。

The last one is just whether you have very strong customer feedback, even from a small group of people.

最后一个问题就是你是否有很强的客户反馈，即使是来自一小群人。

At Color, for example, very early on, we were getting effectively love letters from our customers.

例如，在色彩公司，我们很早就收到了客户的情书。

The company, Color, started off focused on providing people with information about their hereditary risk of certain genetically-driven cancers. We were getting emails from people where they were saying, "Thank you so much for helping me, for making this affordable [crosstalk]

这家名为Color的公司一开始就专注于向人们提供有关其遗传风险的信息，这些风险是由基因引起的癌症。我们收到了来自人们的电子邮件，他们说：“非常感谢你帮助我，让这个相声负担得起。”

Geoff Ralston: For saving their lives, even.

杰夫·拉斯顿：甚至拯救了他们的生命。

Elad Gil: For saving their lives in some cases.

Elad Gil：在某些情况下拯救了他们的生命。

They felt that Color had helped with that, and so we got very strong customer feedback very early on it.

他们认为Color在这方面起到了帮助作用，因此我们很早就得到了很强的客户反馈。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, so it seems like it's some mix of ...

杰夫·拉斯顿：是啊，所以看起来好像是.

Again, I think some of this is intuition, but some mix of retention, customer feedback, and maybe you should break your product and see if people keep on using it.

再一次，我认为有些是直觉，但有些是保留，客户反馈，也许你应该打破你的产品，看看人们是否继续使用它。

Elad Gil: I think there's other metrics, too. For example, people tend to discount growth off of small basis even though the growth is compounding. So, if you're growing organically, 20% a month, even if you're going from 100 to 120 users, that is a real sign of product market fit that a lot of people tend to ignore and not believe because they're like, "Oh, the numbers are so small, it doesn't matter." But if you're consistently adding 20 people, and then 30 people, and then 40 people month after month, that's usually a sign that the thing is really going to work.

Elad Gil：我认为还有其他指标。例如，即使增长是复合的，人们也倾向于在较小的基础上低估增长。所以，如果你是一个有机增长，一个月20%，即使你从100到120用户，这是一个真正的迹象，产品市场适合很多人往往忽视而不相信，因为他们说，“哦，数字是如此之小，这并不重要。”但如果你不断增加20人，然后是30人，然后是每月40人，这通常是一个信号，表明这件事真的会奏效。

Geoff Ralston: This is a while ago, but what went wrong, and what goes wrong for companies during this phase when they're trying to find product market fit?

杰夫·拉斯顿：这是很久以前的事了，但在这一阶段，当公司试图寻找合适的产品市场时，到底出了什么问题，以及发生了什么问题呢？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think almost everything you can imagine can go wrong.

我认为你能想象的几乎所有事情都可能出错。

If you don't have product market fit, that may or may not derail the company.

如果你没有适合的产品市场，这可能会或不会使公司脱轨。

If you have product market fit, then it kind of matters less, although you still want to correct those things.

如果你有适合的产品市场，那么它就不那么重要了，虽然你仍然想纠正这些事情。

I think, for example, at Mixer Labs, the very first product was a wrong product. We initially started off building almost like content aggregation sites or wikis for locations.

例如，我认为，在Mixer实验室，第一个产品是错误的。我们一开始就开始构建类似于内容聚合站点或站点的wiki。

Then, we quickly morphed it into an infrastructure product where we were selling infrastructure to enable geolocation application.

然后，我们迅速地将其转化为一个基础设施产品，在那里我们销售基础设施以启用地理定位应用程序。

This is before there was a big wave of API companies, and so it was one of the first, alongside things like Twilio or some of the really early developer tool companies.

这是在API公司大潮之前，因此它是第一批，除了Twilio或一些真正早期的开发工具公司。

The starting point for their product was much more of a consumer site that allowed you to aggregate content, and we built out very deep infrastructure for that.

他们的产品的起点更多的是一个让你聚合内容的消费网站，我们为此建立了非常深入的基础设施。

Then, we decided that really what we should be doing is selling the infrastructure.

然后，我们决定真正应该做的是出售基础设施。

That was a good example of us changing direction as a startup.

这是我们作为一家初创公司改变方向的一个很好的例子。

Geoff Ralston: What else have you seen go wrong at this early stage that might be instructive, whether around product market fit, the folks you hire, even sort of the business moves, the marketing moves you might make early on?

杰夫·拉斯顿：在这个早期阶段，你还看到了哪些问题可能是有启发性的，无论是围绕产品市场的适合，还是你雇佣的人，甚至是某种商业举动，你可能会在早期做出的营销举动？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think on the hiring side, a lot of people will let not-great people stick around for far too long.

我认为在招聘方面，很多人不会让-优秀的人在这里呆太久。

Then, at my first startup, we actually let somebody go within the first month, one of our first six or seven employees.

然后，在我的第一家创业公司，我们实际上在第一个月内就解雇了一些人，这是我们最初的六七个员工中的一个。

The person was great, and they did well in their career after, but it just wasn't a good fit relative to what we were looking for as a company at the time, so I I think there's a ...

这个人很棒，之后他们的职业生涯也做得很好，但相对于我们当时作为一家公司来说，这并不是一个很好的选择，所以我认为.

There's a old adage that you should either hire extremely well or fire very well. Optimally, you do both.

有句老话说，你要么雇用得非常好，要么炒得很好。最好的做法是两者兼得。

I think a lot of people tolerate a bad hire for way too long.

我想很多人都会容忍一份糟糕的工作太久了。

They'll wait six, seven, eight months and say, "Hey, we have to give them another chance, another chance." But really, you want to have an initial feedback conversation. See if they react. Maybe have one more, and then you have to take action.

他们会等六、七、八个月，然后说：“嘿，我们得再给他们一次机会，再给他们一次机会。”但实际上，你想要进行一次初步的反馈对话。看看他们是否有反应。也许还有一个，然后你必须采取行动。

I think the way you should think about your startup from a hiring perspective is it's almost like a life raft. Your boat is sinking. You're on this little raft, and there's five spots. Who are in those five spots? If the people on the raft aren't the five people that you should have on a raft, you should find the five people. Because you can only support so much from a burden perspective, or a productivity perspective, or a coordination perspective.

我认为，你应该从招聘的角度来看待你的创业公司，因为它就像一只救生筏。你的船在下沉。你在这个小木筏上，有五个斑点。谁在这五个地方？如果木筏上的人不是你应该坐在木筏上的五个人，你就应该找到那五个人。因为你只能从负担的角度，生产力的角度，或者协调的角度来支持这么多。

I think that's a very important mindset to be in in terms of who's on your team.

我认为这是一种非常重要的心态，在你的球队里。

Geoff Ralston: This might be a hard question to answer, but I was sort of thinking about, a lot of times, we focus on what goes wrong.

杰夫·拉斯顿：这可能是一个很难回答的问题，但我在想，很多时候，我们都在关注哪里出了问题。

A lot of things go wrong. You guys have seen out there, things go wrong. You've invested in so many epic companies, and your companies have done great. What goes right in those? What stands out as a set of things that people are doing or steps they're taking that kind of gives you that clue that this might be one of those great companies?

很多事情都出了问题。你们已经看到了，事情出了问题。你投资了这么多史诗般的公司，你的公司也做得很好。这里面是怎么回事？什么是人们正在做的事情或他们正在采取的步骤，这给了你线索，这可能是其中一个伟大的公司？

Elad Gil: Yeah, I think the focus on customers and what customers need very early is an important signal, and then I think building something immediately is really important, too. Now, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be doing analysis. You should absolutely be thinking about the market. You should be thinking about your market strategy. You should be asking who your customers are and defining out your segments. But you should also just build stuff and try it and start to see reactions rapidly.

Elad Gil：是的，我认为早期关注客户和客户需要是一个重要的信号，然后我认为立即建立一些东西也是非常重要的。这并不意味着你不应该做分析。你绝对应该考虑市场。你应该考虑一下你的市场策略。你应该问你的客户是谁，并确定你的细分。但是你也应该建立一些东西，试一试，然后开始快速地看到人们的反应。

I think where I've seen a lot of people fail is they wait and wait and wait in terms of actually building something. Sometimes they just wait too long, where you see these companies that stay in stealth mode for three, four years, and you're like ...

我想我见过很多人失败的地方是他们在实际构建一些东西的时候等待和等待。有时候他们等得太久了，你看到这些公司在隐形模式下呆了三四年，你就像.

That's a terrible sign because you're not actually getting real customer feedback potentially.

这是一个糟糕的迹象，因为你实际上并没有得到真正的客户反馈。

Geoff Ralston: It seems like there's also something about iterating fast in these great companies where there's always something new and better, and it's always better, too.

杰夫·拉斯顿：在这些伟大的公司里，似乎也有一些关于快速迭代的东西，那里总是有一些新的、更好的东西，而且总是更好的。

Elad Gil: Yeah, I think that's definitely true.

Elad Gil：是的，我认为这绝对是真的。

The other thing I've seen some people do, which I think actually helps a lot is from day one, they focus on the velocity of the team. So, they may be focused on the build environment early and making it so that anybody can run a full instance of the product with a single line of code just to set it up, right? There are actually things that you can do to make your team dramatically more productive that a lot of people don't do.

我看到一些人做的另一件事，我认为这是非常有帮助的，从第一天开始，他们就专注于团队的速度。因此，他们可能会早期关注构建环境，使其任何人都可以运行产品的完整实例，只需一行代码就可以设置它，对吗？实际上，你可以做一些事情，让你的团队更有效率，而很多人却不这么做。

Anytime they onboard somebody, it takes them two weeks to get the damn thing running on their laptop instead of actually saying, "How do we make it so that any incremental person who hires or anytime we push a change, we can instantly see its effect?" I think there's almost like little things you can do along the way there, too.

每当他们上船时，他们都要花两周的时间才能在笔记本上运行这个该死的东西，而不是说，“我们怎么才能做到这一点，让任何雇佣或推动变革的增量人员，我们都能立即看到它的效果？”我觉得在去那里的路上你也可以做一些很小的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Since almost all of the companies that we're talking to are driven by human capital, people don't pay enough attention to making that human capital as effective and efficient as possible. Speaking of human capital, you are CEO in both your companies.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。由于我们所讨论的几乎所有的公司都是由人力资本驱动的，所以人们没有足够的注意使这些人力资本尽可能的有效和高效。说到人力资本，你是两家公司的首席执行官。

In fact, you've given a lot of advice to CEOs both as an investor and in High Growth Handbook, but later on, advising a CEOs and other executives how to be most effective. How do you think about that for early-stage startups?

事实上，无论是作为投资者还是在“高增长手册”中，你都给首席执行官们提供了很多建议，但后来，你建议首席执行官和其他高管如何提高效率。对于早期创业公司，你是怎么想的？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think for an early-stage startup, ultimately the focus should be on how do you make your team as effective as possible if you have a team? Effective means two things. One is people are all moving in the same direction, and there's clear goals, and there's a clear sense of what you're actually building and why. But also it means, to your point, iterating quickly.

我认为对于早期创业来说，最终的重点应该是如果你有一个团队，你应该如何使你的团队尽可能有效？有效意味着两件事。一是人们都在朝着同一个方向前进，有着明确的目标，并且清楚地意识到你实际上在建立什么，以及为什么。但这也意味着，在你的观点上，快速迭代。

It means talking to customers early.

这意味着要早点和顾客交谈。

It means, again, focusing on product market fit. Because I think the mistake that people make is you could have the happiest, most wonderful group of people in the world, but if you never find product market fit, your company is going to die because you're just not going to have the revenue to support it, or the cash to support it, or you won't be able to raise more money. So, whether you have kombucha or not is secondary to just building something that people really want.

这意味着，再一次，专注于产品市场的契合。因为我认为人们犯的错误是，你可以拥有世界上最快乐、最棒的一群人，但如果你永远找不到合适的产品市场，你的公司就会倒闭，因为你没有足够的收入来支持它，也没有足够的现金来支持它，否则你就无法筹集更多的资金。所以，不管你有没有康普茶，都是次要的，而不是人们真正想要的东西。

I think people get distracted along the entrepreneurial journey, either in terms of eventually if they get funded, and they get invited to all these events, and all these other things start to distract them.

我认为，人们在创业之旅中会分心，不管是从最终是否获得资金的角度来看，他们都会被邀请参加所有这些活动，而所有其他事情都会分散他们的注意力。

There's a lot of sort of entrepreneurial distractions that could get your attention, when really the core thing is are people buying your product, and at what scale? And are you growing at a good rate? Now, that's if you're on the venture track, and you want truly a high gross breakout company.

有很多企业家的干扰会引起你的注意，而真正的核心问题是人们购买你的产品，规模有多大？你的成长速度好吗？现在，这是如果你是在风险轨道上，你想要一个真正的高总突破公司。

There's all sorts of other startups you could start. You could start a lifestyle business, and that could be great.

还有很多其他的创业公司可以开始。你可以开始一个生活方式的生意，这可能是很棒的。

There's a variety of different reasons to do a startup. So, part of it, too, is asking yourself what do you actually care about as a founder, and what's your objective? And then, are your actions actually mapping against those objectives? I think too many people just go on a default path that isn't the right path for them.

创业有很多不同的原因。所以，也有一部分是问自己，作为一个创始人，你真正关心的是什么，你的目标是什么？那么，你的行动实际上是与这些目标相对应的吗？我认为太多的人只是走了一条不适合他们的默认路径。

Geoff Ralston: What should a CEO be spending most of their time doing?

杰夫·拉斯顿：首席执行官大部分时间都在做什么？

Elad Gil: I think it differs early versus late. For an early company, it's going to be building, so are you actually helping to build a product? You may not be the person that should be building the product.

Elad Gil：我认为早和晚是不同的。对于一家早期的公司来说，它是在建设中，所以你实际上是在帮助开发一种产品吗？你可能不是应该制造产品的人。

I'm just saying if it's one or two of you, you're probably building or selling. Second is hiring and making sure that the team is productive and focused on the right direction.

我只是想说，如果是你们中的一两个人，你们很可能是在建造或出售。第二，招聘并确保团队富有成效，并专注于正确的方向。

Then third, making sure that you don't run out of money. Lastly, I mean, it's avoiding fights with your co-founders and things like that.

第三，确保你的钱不会用完。最后，我的意思是，这是避免与你的联合创始人和诸如此类的争吵。

I often say that an early-stage startup largely fails for three reasons or only has to do three things. One is you need to find product market fit, which is incredibly hard. You need to make sure that you have the money to survive, and you need to not fight with your co-founder because that'll slow everything down. For an early stage startup, that's ultimately everything you need to do.

我经常说，早期的初创公司主要因为三个原因而失败，或者只需要做三件事。一个是你需要找到合适的产品市场，这是难以置信的困难。你需要确保你有足够的钱来生存，你不需要和你的联合创始人打架，因为那样会拖慢一切。对于早期创业来说，这最终是你需要做的一切。

I mean, you need to hire, and there's different aspects of selling that you really need to focus on, selling investors, selling customers, selling hires. But it's either build or sell. For a late-stage company, it gets way more complicated. You're still selling for all sorts of reasons, but then you're also much more focused on how do I enable this thing to scale in terms of processes, in terms of people? How do I hire executives? How do I internationalize? How do I launch new products? How do I buy companies? Then you realize quickly that that has to be a team effort because no one person can do all those things.

我的意思是，你需要雇佣，而销售有不同的方面，你真的需要关注，销售投资者，销售客户，销售员工。但要么建要么卖。对于一家后期公司来说，情况要复杂得多。你仍然为了各种各样的原因而销售，但是你也更加关注如何让这个东西在过程和人的层面上进行扩展？我该怎么雇主管？我如何国际化？如何推出新产品？我如何收购公司？然后你很快意识到，这必须是一个团队的努力，因为没有一个人能够做所有这些事情。

Then you really start asking, okay, how do I build out and manage a really effective team?

然后你真的开始问，好吧，我如何建立和管理一个真正有效的团队？

Geoff Ralston: One of the hard roles that a CEO has, I suppose, is to figure out, when you don't have product market fit, whether you need to tweak the product or you need to do more of a pivot. You mentioned that at Mixer Labs, you guys had to do a pivot.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我想，首席执行官最难的角色之一就是，当你没有合适的产品市场时，你需要调整产品，还是需要做更多的工作。你说过在Mixer实验室，你们必须做一个枢轴。

A lot of people ask that question, like, how do you know? Like, when do you know that you've hit the wall with what you're doing, and you need to do a more significant shift?

很多人问这个问题，比如，你怎么知道的？比如，你什么时候知道你已经用你正在做的事情撞上了墙，你需要做一个更重要的转变？

Elad Gil: Yeah, it's really hard because you ... Most startups build something for six months to a year.

是的，这真的很难，因为你.大多数初创企业在六个月到一年的时间里都会建立一些东西。

They launch it, and then they hit a wall.

他们发射了它，然后撞到了墙上。

Then the question is is that a real wall, or is that a fake wall? I think it's incredibly hard to know.

那么问题是那是一堵真正的墙，还是一堵假墙？我觉得很难知道。

I think if you're three, four years into something, and you're just not seeing any traction or momentum, you clearly waited too long.

我认为，如果你已经做了三四年的事情，而你并没有看到任何牵引力和动力，那么你显然等待的时间太长了。

There's counterexamples to that, and there are always going to be counterexamples. For example, TomTom, that European GPS company that ended up for a while being one of the most valuable companies in Europe ...

这是有反例的，而且总是会有反例的。例如，TomTom，这家欧洲GPS公司最终成为了欧洲最有价值的公司之一.

I think it was literally four people in a room for, like, six years, iterating through different ideas until they came up with the concept of doing a GPSs, which, of course, now are subsumed by phones. But they took a really long time to get there. Most of the companies that I've seen work tend to work early, at least in terms of adoption, or at least in terms of some core metrics. So, I think it's possible that in today's environment where capital is really loose, people actually wait too long to pivot or to shut down because they can keep raising more money.

我想大概有四个人在一个房间里呆了六年，反复思考不同的想法，直到他们想出了做一个GPS的概念，当然，现在已经被手机包括在内了。但他们花了很长时间才到那里。我看到的大多数公司倾向于早期工作，至少在采用方面，或者至少在一些核心指标方面。所以，我认为，在资本非常宽松的今天，人们可能会等待太久才能转向或关闭，因为他们可以继续筹集更多的资金。

Actually, I think that's a bad thing because it's locking up great people at the height of their creative point in their lives and preventing them from going and doing something else. So, I do think at some point, you need to have that really frank assessment and maybe do it periodically. But should we really keep going? Then, if we're going to keep going, I think the key question is when you pivot, the one thing I would advocate is being willing to restart completely. Because typically when people pivot, they pivot within the same market versus across markets.

事实上，我认为这是一件坏事，因为它把伟大的人锁在他们生命中创造力的顶峰，阻止他们去做其他的事情。因此，我确实认为，在某一时刻，你需要进行非常坦率的评估，也许定期进行评估。但我们真的应该继续吗？那么，如果我们要继续下去，我认为关键的问题是何时转向，我主张的一件事是愿意完全重启。因为通常情况下，当人们转向时，他们是在同一个市场内而不是跨市场。

If you're in a bad market, that means you're going to die because you're just going to go onto the next thing. You say, "Hey, we have all those sunk costs." You start iterating on that new thing, and it doesn't work either.

如果你在一个糟糕的市场，那就意味着你会死，因为你只会去做下一件事。你说，“嘿，我们有这么多沉没成本。”你开始迭代那个新的东西，它也不起作用。

Geoff Ralston: So, it's sort of a decision between ...

杰夫·拉斯顿：所以，这是在.

An evaluation of the market being bad versus it's just you have the wrong product. Could be great market and bad product, but ...

对市场的评价是坏的，而不是你有错误的产品。可能是个不错的市场和糟糕的产品，但是.

Elad Gil: Yeah, you should assess it from first principles.

Elad Gil：是的，你应该从基本原则来评估它。

Then, if you decide that you're done with the business, you have three options. You shut it down, you sell, or you pivot.

然后，如果你决定做完这件事，你有三个选择。你关闭它，你卖掉，或者你转向。

If you sell, my suggestion would be sell to somebody that's clearly breaking out.

如果你卖了，我的建议就是卖给一个明显的人。

Geoff Ralston: I think I've heard you say before that, speaking of being in a great market, that that's sort of your fundamental test.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我想我以前听你说过，说到在一个伟大的市场，这是你的基本考验。

If you believe that there's this incredible market opportunity, you want to be in there. You want to be fighting that fight. Even if you don't have the right product at first, you can find it.

如果你相信有这样一个难以置信的市场机会，你想要在那里。你想打这场仗。即使你一开始没有合适的产品，你也能找到它。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think the singular determinant of startup success is the market, and it's not the strength of the team.

我认为决定创业成功的唯一因素是市场，而不是团队的力量。

I think a lot of people talk about how great teams will always figure it out.

我想很多人都在谈论球队是多么的优秀。

I've seen great team after great team in a terrible market just die because they're in a bad market. So, they never have the opportunity or the time to really figure it out or to iterate as much as they could if they were in a very good market where there's just cash inflows hitting you despite what you're doing.

我见过一支又一支伟大的球队在糟糕的市场中死去，因为他们在一个糟糕的市场上。所以，他们从来没有机会，也没有时间去真正解决这个问题，如果他们在一个非常好的市场上，不管你在做什么，只要有现金流入，他们就会尽可能多地迭代。

Andy Rachleff, one of the founders of Benchmark, has what some people now call Rachleff's law, which is great team, terrible market, market wins. So, it doesn't matter how good the team is if the market's awful.

Benchmark的创始人之一AndyRachleff，拥有一些人现在所说的Rachleff定律，即伟大的团队，糟糕的市场，市场的胜利。所以，如果市场糟糕的话，球队有多好并不重要。

Terrible team, great market, market wins. You can actually be not very good at what you're doing and still do very well. Your product's half broken, but it's still getting massive adoption because you're in a great market.

糟糕的团队，伟大的市场，市场胜利。实际上，你可能并不擅长你正在做的事情，而且仍然做得很好。你的产品坏了一半，但它仍然被大量采用，因为你在一个伟大的市场。

Then, there's great team, great market. Something magical happens, which is like a Google or Facebook where you had people who then executed, they added new product lines, and they were really great at what they were doing in terms of scaling it to the next level.

然后，有伟大的团队，伟大的市场。一些神奇的事情发生了，就像谷歌或者Facebook，你让人们执行，他们增加了新的产品线，他们真的很擅长于把它扩展到更高的水平。

I do think that's very true.

我确实认为这是真的。

I've seen many, many great teams just die in a terrible market, and then I've seen a few bad teams do very well.

我见过很多伟大的球队在糟糕的市场中死去，然后我看到了一些糟糕的球队表现得非常好。

That to me was very surprising.

这对我来说是非常令人惊讶的。

It feels very non-egalitarian or merit based.

这感觉非常不平等或功绩为基础。

Geoff Ralston: Why do you think it is that so many teams choose such bad markets?

杰夫·拉斯顿：你认为为什么这么多球队选择如此糟糕的市场？

Elad Gil: I think it's maybe three reasons. One is sometimes people just jump into things, and they just start building without actually thinking it through. Sometimes that works really well because it's a product you want or need, and so you're building it for everybody else. But sometimes it's something that has been tried many, many times before.

Elad Gil：我想大概有三个原因。一种是人们有时只是跳进事物中，而他们只是在没有真正想清楚的情况下就开始建设。有时候，这真的很好，因为它是你想要或需要的产品，所以你为其他人建造它。但有时这是曾经尝试过很多次的东西。

That doesn't mean it won't work in the future, but maybe you should look at the history and ask why didn't it work, and what should I be doing differently versus just doing the same thing again that's failed five times? The second thing I've seen a lot of people fail at is what I'd call multi-miracle startups.

这并不意味着它在未来不会起作用，但也许你应该回顾一下历史，并问它为什么不起作用，我应该做什么，而不是再次做同样的事情，失败了五次？我看到很多人失败的第二件事是我称之为多奇迹创业公司。

I think every startup needs at least one miracle to succeed. Because if it was obvious that it was going to work, everybody would already be doing it, and so you wouldn't have an opportunity.

我认为每一家创业公司至少需要一个奇迹才能成功。因为如果很明显它会起作用，那么每个人都会这么做，所以你就没有机会了。

In some sense, startups only have opportunities in markets that are non-obvious, which means they have to overcome some obstacle.

从某种意义上说，初创企业在市场上的机会并不明显，这意味着它们必须克服一些障碍。

The distribution needs to magically work, or the product and the price point need to magically work, or whatever it is. But there's some companies where they come up with two miracles for their startup.

分销需要神奇的工作，或产品和价格点需要神奇地工作，或任何东西。但是有些公司为他们的创业创造了两个奇迹。

They say, "Our stage one of the startup is we're going to do X, and then stage Y is we're going to do this other thing that's completely unrelated. But because we did X, we can suddenly do Y." Usually those fail because you're saying, well, you have to miracles, and you're compounding very low probability, so you're just bound to fail.

他们说，“我们创业的第一阶段是做X，然后是Y阶段，我们要做另一件完全不相关的事情。但是因为我们做了X，我们可以突然做Y。”通常这些失败是因为你说，你必须要有奇迹，而且你的概率很低，所以你注定要失败。

An example would be there was an era where people said that the way to compete with Yelp was to start an events product, which is an open space, win in events, and then it's adjacent enough to what Yelp does that you could add local listings.

举个例子，有一个时代，人们说与Yelp竞争的方法是开发一个活动产品，它是一个开放的空间，在活动中获胜，然后它与Yelp所做的足够接近，所以你可以添加本地列表。

Then, you'd win in local listings.

那你就能在本地名单上赢了。

That's a terrible approach. You should say either, "I want to win in events," and just double down on that, or, "I want to go after listings, and then I'm just going to do that." But this sort of multi-step thing tends to fail.

这是个糟糕的方法。你应该说，“我想在比赛中获胜”，然后加倍努力，或者说，“我想在上市之后，然后我就这么做。”但是这种多步骤的事情往往会失败。

Geoff Ralston: Which is, I think, an object lesson in how not to approach your investor meetings.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我认为，这是一个关于如何不参加投资者会议的客观教训。

If you're talking to an investor, and you have a whole bunch of miracles that have to happen before you're a big company, then that investor's probably not going to be that interested.

如果你在和一个投资者交谈，在你成为一家大公司之前，你有很多奇迹要发生，那么那个投资者可能就不会那么感兴趣了。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

The most common miracle that's quoted today is a data moat. People say, "Well, we'll generate tons of data, and then we'll be differentiated." I think in genomics, something like that could work, but outside of that, I actually think I've never seen a company pull that off in terms of a broader ... Data is the only thing that's their asset, and then they're going to somehow do something with that asset.

今天引用的最常见的奇迹是一条数据护城河。人们说，“好吧，我们会生成大量的数据，然后我们会被区分开来。”我认为在基因组学中，类似的东西是可行的，但除此之外，我认为我从未见过一家公司在更广泛的范围内实现这一目标.数据是他们唯一的资产，然后他们会以某种方式对这些资产做些什么。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, or we're going to get ... Our AI is going to get the smartest because we'll have the most data.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的，否则我们会.我们的人工智能将得到最聪明的，因为我们将拥有最多的数据。

Then our AI will be the best, and therefore, we'll win."

然后我们的人工智能将是最好的，因此，我们将获胜。“

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: Just back to the CEO question, how should teams choose their CEO? Who should be the CEO?

杰夫·拉斯顿：回到CEO的问题上，团队应该如何选择他们的首席执行官？谁应该是首席执行官？

Elad Gil: It's a good question.

Elad Gil：这是个好问题。

I mean, there's different ways that you could describe or argue it. Ultimately in some cases it's a clear, hey, this person is the person we're choosing.

我是说，你可以用不同的方式来描述或者争辩。最终，在某些情况下，这是一个明确的，嘿，这个人是我们选择的人。

In some cases it's a huge argument.

在某些情况下，这是一个巨大的争论。

I think the most important thing is to resolve it even if you get it wrong. Because you can always correct the wrong thing, but at least you have somebody in charge.

我认为最重要的是即使你弄错了也要解决它。因为你总是可以纠正错误的事情，但至少你有一个负责人。

I think a lot of founding teams end up with a lot of fights that then slow down the company dramatically if they don't have somebody clearly in charge.

我认为，许多创始团队最终会有很多争斗，如果没有明确的负责人，公司就会大幅放缓。

I think if it's a very technical product, it's often better to have the technologist in charge. So, say that you had a businessperson and technologist. Because if it's two technologists, I don't know how to differentiate between who ... Maybe somebody who's a little bit better at selling or recruiting or that part of the job. Maybe that's the right person for the CEO if it's two technologists.

我认为如果这是一种技术含量很高的产品，最好由技术专家来负责。所以，假设你有一个商人和技术专家。因为如果是两位技术专家，我不知道如何区分谁.也许是一个比较擅长销售或招聘的人或者是这部分工作的人。如果是两位技术人员，也许这位CEO就是合适的人选。

If it's a businessperson and a technologist, usually the businessperson is going to be better at those things, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be the CEO. Because often the iteration of the product and the understanding of the product is driven by the technologist, and that really impacts how you sell it, how you iterate on it, and the decisions that you make along the way. But honestly, I think any configuration can work.

如果是商人和技术专家，通常情况下，商人会在这些事情上表现得更好，但这并不一定意味着他们应该是首席执行官。因为产品的迭代和对产品的理解往往是由技术人员驱动的，这真的会影响你如何销售它，如何迭代它，以及你在过程中所做的决定。但老实说，我认为任何配置都可以工作。

I think sometimes a founding pair will be very self-honest.

我想有时候一对创始人会很诚实。

They'll just be like, "Oh, this person is better at the things that we need from the CEO today, which means better at recruiting, better at fundraising, better at selling and better at sort of setting vision and direction." Then it's a clear shot in terms of who should be.

他们会说，“哦，这个人在我们今天需要的东西上做得更好，这意味着更好的招聘，更好的筹资，更好的销售，更好的设定愿景和方向。”那么，就应该是谁来说，这是一个明确的机会。

Geoff Ralston: You might even say that you should put in the position of the CEO the person who's going to help you find product market fit, who's going to drive the company to product market fit sooner and better?

杰夫·拉斯顿：你甚至可以说，你应该让首席执行官这个人来帮助你找到适合你的产品市场，谁能让公司更快更好地适应产品市场？

Elad Gil: That's a good point. Yeah.

Elad Gil：这是一个很好的观点。嗯

Geoff Ralston: I wonder.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我想知道。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: Why were you the CEO? Because it was your idea? Because ...

杰夫·拉斯顿：你为什么是首席执行官？因为这是你的主意？因为.。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

It's interesting. For example, with Color, I stepped down as CEO after four years.

很有趣。例如，在色彩公司，四年后，我辞去了首席执行官一职。

The origin of the company was a bit of a mix, but ultimately it was driven by my co-founder's personal story where he himself is a BRCA2 carrier. His mother has had breast cancer twice. He's had members of his family die of the disease.

该公司的起源有点混合，但最终它是由我的共同创始人的个人故事，他自己是一家BRCA 2运营商。他母亲患过两次乳腺癌。他的家人死于这种疾病。

And so the company was started in some sense as a form of patient advocacy where we said it's ridiculous that people can't afford and access these really important pieces of genetic information that can really drive what they should be doing from a health perspective in their lives.

从某种意义上说，这家公司是作为一种病人辩护的形式成立的，我们说，人们负担不起和获取这些非常重要的基因信息，这是很荒谬的，这些基因信息可以从健康的角度来推动他们的生活。

I think that-

我觉得-

Geoff Ralston: So, it's his passion and his drive more than anything?

杰夫·拉斯顿：所以，这是他的激情和动力胜过一切？

Elad Gil: It was his passion and drive.

这是他的激情和动力。

I mean, I had a lot of passion for it, having worked in biology and things. But fundamentally, I think one of the reasons the shift we made is so good is because this is something that he's truly lived and cares about deeply.

我的意思是，我对它有很大的热情，曾经在生物学和其他方面工作过。但从根本上说，我认为我们之所以做出如此好的转变，其中一个原因是因为这是他真正生活并深深关心的事情。

I think that really comes through as well in the choices that are made in the product, and how do you think about patient data privacy, and how do you think about all these things? I think he had a very deep intuitive sense of what it would mean for him, which I think was very important in the context of what Color was doing.

我认为这在产品中的选择中也能体现出来，你是如何看待病人数据隐私的，以及你是如何看待所有这些事情的？我认为他有一个非常深刻的直觉，它将意味着什么对他来说，我认为这是非常重要的背景下，颜色是做什么。

Geoff Ralston: It seems like a very modern way to look at the CEO as the ultimate product advocate, Steve Jobs being the obvious example there.

杰夫·拉斯顿：将首席执行官视为最终的产品拥护者，似乎是一种非常现代的方式，史蒂夫·乔布斯就是明显的例子。

Elad Gil: I think in tech, we're very imprinted on that style. But there's also great examples of CEOs who are amazing salespeople. Benioff started off in sales in, I think, Oracle or something, right?

Elad Gil：我认为在科技界，我们对这种风格有很深的印象。但也有很好的例子证明首席执行官是出色的销售人员。我想，贝尼奥夫是从甲骨文什么的销售开始的，对吧？

Geoff Ralston: Right.

杰夫·拉斯顿：对。

Elad Gil: There's all sorts of examples of non-technology CEOs who've done extremely well. Or, you have a situation where you do a mix. Like at Google, Eric Schmidt had a PhD in CS, but he'd also run Novell before. He'd run a public company, and so it was somebody who'd done the business side of things as well as the technical side.

Elad Gil：有各种各样的非技术CEO的例子，他们做得非常好。或者，你有一种情况，你做一个混合。就像在谷歌一样，埃里克·施密特(EricSchmidt)拥有CS博士学位，但他以前也经营过Novell。他会经营一家上市公司，所以是他在做生意的同时也做了技术方面的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。

I haven't figured out whether it's a trend or not, but it seems a little bit that way.

我还没有弄清楚这是否是一种趋势，但似乎有点这样。

I always find I prefer if I'm looking at investing in a company or looking at a company for YC that a product person ...

我总是发现，如果我想投资一家公司，或者是一家YC的公司，而不是一个产品的人.

That the CEO really has a feel for the product anyway.

不管怎么说，首席执行官确实对这个产品有一种感觉。

Elad Gil: Yeah, I totally agree.

是的，我完全同意。

Geoff Ralston: Let's transition a little bit to fundraising. We've been talking a fair amount about that recently in Startup School.

杰夫·拉斯顿：让我们转向筹款。我们最近在创业学校讨论了相当多的问题。

I don't know. Did you have interesting experiences fundraising that you can talk about in your two companies, Mixer Labs and Color?

我不知道在你的两家公司，Mixer实验室和Color，你有什么有趣的筹资经验吗？

Elad Gil: Sure. We took a very different fundraising strategy. For the first startup that we did, we ended up raising a seed from a brand-name venture fund, plus a bunch of angels.

Elad Gil：当然。我们采取了非常不同的筹资策略。在我们第一次创业的时候，我们从一家知名的风险基金那里筹到了一粒种子，外加一群天使。

Then we did a second round from sort of a super angel or small-fund group.

然后，我们做了第二轮，一个超级天使或小型基金集团。

The biggest issue we had there is we had a bad investor who, as we were exiting the company, basically tried to claw more value for themselves as part of our exit.

我们面临的最大问题是，我们遇到了一个糟糕的投资者，在我们离开公司的时候，他基本上试图为自己争取更多的价值，作为我们退出公司的一部分。

This is sort of a Midas List investor who's very well known now.

这是一位名叫米达斯的名单投资者，他现在已经很出名了。

The second company, my-

第二家公司，我的-

Geoff Ralston: Hang on.

杰夫·拉斯顿：等一下。

This is a successful investor who tried to screw other people over while they-

这是一个成功的投资者，他试图在别人-

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: Huh.

杰夫·拉斯顿：嗯。

Elad Gil: Yeah, I mean-

是的，我是说-

Geoff Ralston: And their name ... No, don't tell me. Shouldn't go there, I guess, but-

他们的名字.。不，别告诉我。我想不应该去那里，但是-

Elad Gil: I'm always tempted, but I always stop myself. But I do think that there are some brand name investors who are dicks, right? So, you should be careful in terms of who you work with. You should diligence them and ask the founders where either things that didn't go well or where there was some issue over time or whatever it is.

Elad Gil：我总是被诱惑，但我总是阻止自己。但我确实认为有一些品牌投资者是混蛋，对吗？所以，你应该小心与谁一起工作。你应该让他们精打细算，问问创始人，哪些事情进展得不好，哪些是时间上的问题，或者是其他什么问题。

That's more likely to reveal the truth about an investor than asking in a situation where everything worked.

这更有可能揭示投资者的真实情况，而不是在一切正常的情况下询问。

Geoff Ralston: We like to say a YC that being nice is a big advantage, but it doesn't always work.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我们喜欢说YC，友好是一个很大的优势，但它并不总是有效的。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: Sometimes it's not true.

杰夫·拉斯顿：有时候这不是真的。

Elad Gil: Yeah, and I think I would differentiate between two things.

Elad Gil：是的，我想我会区分两件事。

I think you want investors who will push you, or question what you're doing maybe is a better way to phrase it. Because I do see some founders sometimes uncomfortable with being asked about some of their decisions, and you should be asked about your decisions.

我认为你希望投资者能推动你，或者质疑你在做什么，也许是一个更好的表达方式。因为我确实看到一些创始人有时对被问及他们的一些决定感到不舒服，你应该被问及你的决定。

That's a way to get better.

这是一种让自己变得更好的方法。

It may be a naive question that an investor asks, but that may be the thing that makes you think about something that you should be doing differently, or maybe it just reaffirms what you're doing is right. Right? I would differentiate between that and somebody acting badly in terms of clawing value for themselves or doing other things.

这可能是投资者提出的一个天真的问题，但它可能会让你思考一些你应该做的不同的事情，或者它只是重申了你所做的是正确的。对吗？我会把它和那些为自己攫取价值或做其他事情的人区分开来。

I mean, we did have ... We had a pool of investors.

我是说我们确实.。我们有很多投资者。

There's only one who acted badly out of a dozen people, so it's not ... Or 15 people or something.

十几个人中只有一个人表现不好，所以不是.或者15个人什么的。

Geoff Ralston: How easy was it to raise money at Mixer Labs, your first company?

杰夫·拉斯顿：在你的第一家公司Mixer实验室筹集资金有多容易？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

It took us about two or three months.

我们花了两三个月的时间。

In general, I think you hear the news about these fundraisers that happen in a week, and you think every fundraiser's going to take a week. But if you're actually being thoughtful on your side as well, it should take a couple of months because otherwise, you're not getting to know the people that you're fundraising from. Usually what happens is you'll find that until somebody really tips, most people are scared to jump in, which is really weird. Right? In general, you'll find that most investors are fear driven versus ambition driven.

总的来说，我认为你听到了一周内发生的筹款活动的消息，你认为每一次募捐活动都需要一周的时间。但如果你真的在考虑你的立场，这应该需要几个月的时间，因为否则，你就无法了解你正在筹集资金的人。通常情况下，你会发现，直到有人真的小费，大多数人害怕跳进，这真的很奇怪。对吗？一般来说，你会发现大多数投资者是恐惧驱动的，而不是野心驱动的。

They're kind of scared of missing something versus really excited and believe vigorously in something. So, high conviction investors are actually very valuable in my opinion.

他们有点害怕错过什么，而不是真的很兴奋，并积极地相信一些东西。所以，在我看来，高信念的投资者实际上是非常有价值的。

Geoff Ralston: Right.

杰夫·拉斯顿：对。

They're few and far between.

他们很少。

It's hard to be the first money in on a company. You have to just really believe, especially with a new founder.

很难成为公司的第一笔资金。你必须真的相信，尤其是和一个新的创始人在一起。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

A lot of investors fall for the opposite of that, which is there's a brand name investor in. So, they go in, but it's actually a bad investment, because everybody makes mistakes.

很多投资者都倾向于相反的做法，那就是有一个品牌投资者。因此，他们进入，但这实际上是一个糟糕的投资，因为每个人都会犯错。

Geoff Ralston: They're sheep.

杰夫·拉斯顿：他们是羊。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: How about with Color? You'd been a successful entrepreneur already. You were a well-known executive at that point, and so you were sort of in a different spot raising for Color?

杰夫·拉斯顿：颜色怎么样？你已经是个成功的企业家了。在那个时候你是一位著名的高管，所以你在不同的地方为“颜色”做宣传？

Elad Gil: Yeah, I think for many founders on their second company, it's much easier because they have relationships. My co-founder and I did most of our seed, and then we brought in people for the A and as people that we'd known for a while and that we really trusted and respected. We had Joe Lonsdale and Vinod from Khosla Ventures come in for our A. For the C for Mixer Labs, we really had to network to get intros. We met Michael Dearing as he was just starting to invest. We were one of the first companies he invested in, and we met him through Kim Scott, who wrote the book Radical Candor.

Elad Gil：是的，我认为对于第二家公司的许多创始人来说，这要容易得多，因为他们有关系。我和我的共同创始人做了我们的大部分种子，然后我们为A引进了一些人，作为我们认识了一段时间，我们真正信任和尊敬的人。我们有来自Khosla Ventures的JoeLonsdale和Vinod参加了我们的A.为Mixer实验室设计的C，我们真的需要通过网络来获得自我介绍。我们在迈克尔·迪林刚开始投资的时候见过他。我们是他最早投资的公司之一，我们是通过金·斯科特认识他的，他写了一本“激进坦率”一书。

I worked with her at Google.

我和她一起在谷歌工作。

I just asked people I know, "Who do you know that's investing right now?" And then we ended up having Sequoia in the round, Reid Hoffman when he was still an individual and evolved from AngelList. We had a bunch of really great people line up, but we had to network for the first few.

我只是问我认识的人，“你现在知道谁在投资？”然后我们得到了红杉在轮，里德霍夫曼时，他仍然是一个个体，从安吉利斯特进化而来。我们有一群真正伟大的人排成一排，但我们必须为第一批人建立网络。

I think it was Dearing maybe who tipped first, or somebody else, and then everybody kind of catalyzed.

我想可能是迪林先给小费的，或者是其他人，然后每个人都被催促了。

Geoff Ralston: How does someone get a meeting with Elad Gil?

杰夫·拉斯顿：怎么会有人和埃尔德·吉尔见面？

Elad Gil: You make it sound like that's a valuable thing, but I think a ...

Elad Gil：你说这听起来很有价值，但我觉得.

Geoff Ralston: Well, it depends whether those companies that you invested in would have been successful without your investment. Maybe it's the most valuable thing you can get.

杰夫·拉斯顿：好吧，这取决于你投资的那些公司没有你的投资是否会成功。也许这是你能得到的最有价值的东西。

Elad Gil: I think that the most successful companies and 95% of the cases are successful despite their investors.

EladGil：我认为最成功的公司和95%的案例是成功的，尽管他们的投资者。

I shouldn't say despite.

我不应该说尽管。

I should say irregardless. Now, the investors may help optimize certain things, or they may bring in the key exec.

我应该说不管。现在，投资者可能会帮助优化某些事情，或者他们可能会引入关键的高管。

I'm not trying to minimize the impact of investors.

我不是想把投资者的影响降到最低。

I just think product market fit is such a raw force that it's helpful to have people around you who can help with scaling and other things.

我只是认为产品市场适合是一个如此原始的力量，它是有帮助的人在你身边谁可以帮助缩放和其他事情。

I've seen companies go the other way where they have a lot of bad capital all the way through all their rounds, and the founders are drowning for help. So, you really do see a difference.

我见过一些公司走到了另一条路，它们拥有大量不良资本，而创始人们却在埋头寻求帮助。所以，你确实看到了不同之处。

I'm not saying that there isn't a difference.

我不是说没有区别。

Actually, I know one company in particular where they had a series of initial weak investors, and their board meetings are completely ineffectual.

事实上，我知道有一家公司，特别是在他们最初有一系列弱投资者的地方，他们的董事会会议是完全无效的。

They haven't gotten a lot of help.

他们没有得到多少帮助。

They haven't built out an executive team. Like, it shows. So, I'm not saying that.

他们还没有组建一个执行团队。就像，它显示了。所以我没那么说。

I'm just saying to get from zero to one, it's not your investors who will do it most of the time.

我只是说从零到一，大部分时间都不是你的投资者做的。

There are some counter-examples, like I think a Paul Graham helped actually with some of the very early ideas for Reddit and things like that.

有一些反例，比如我认为保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)实际上帮助了Reddit的一些早期想法，诸如此类的东西。

Geoff Ralston: Airbnb especially.

杰夫·拉斯顿：尤其是Airbnb。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: But it's pretty unusual for an investor to be transformative for a company.

杰夫·拉斯顿：但对于一家公司来说，投资者的转变是很不寻常的。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: So, getting that meeting?

杰夫·拉斯顿：那么，参加那个会议？

Elad Gil: Oh.

埃尔德·吉尔：哦。

I think the best way is to get an introduction through a founder that I already know or somebody else that I already know so that it's in network.

我认为最好的方法是通过我已经认识的创始人或者其他我已经认识的人来做介绍，这样就可以在网络上了。

I think if you can't find a way to do that, then you're probably not going to find a way to get customers. You're not going to find a way to get hires. You're not going to find a way to do all sorts of things, so I think that's the best way.

我认为如果你找不到办法去做，那你可能就找不到办法去争取顾客了。你不会想办法找到工作的。你不会想办法做各种各样的事情，所以我认为这是最好的方法。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。

It seems like Paul Graham's original idea of doing things that don't scale works across different domains, not just building product, but figuring out how to get to the right investor and get that first person to tip?

保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)最初提出的不按比例行事的想法，不仅适用于不同的领域，不仅是产品的开发，还包括如何找到合适的投资者，让第一个人给小费？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

It's a component of almost everything you end up doing as a startup. Hiring is also not going to be scalable early, and you're just going to have to grind through giant lists of people. For example, at Color, because we are a CLIA, CAP lab, and we're focused on the regulatory compliance of what we do, we had to hire specialists called CLSs into the lab very early because they had licenses that allowed them to operate certain types of tests.

它是你作为一家初创公司所做的几乎所有事情的组成部分。招聘也不会提前扩展，你只需要仔细研究一下庞大的员工名单。例如，在Color，因为我们是一个CLIA，CAP实验室，而且我们专注于我们所做的工作的法规遵从性，所以我们不得不很早就雇佣名为CLSS的专家进入实验室，因为他们拥有允许他们操作某些类型测试的许可证。

In the state of California, we could only find two or 300 CLSs total, and we had to hire two or three of them. We had to hire a 1% of all of these people in the state of California, and we wanted to find people who are very good.

在加州，我们只能找到两三百个CLSS，我们不得不雇佣其中的两三个。我们不得不在加州雇用1%的这些人，我们想找到非常优秀的人。

If you have a license that's very rare, it means you can get hired really easily, which doesn't necessarily mean that you're great.

如果你有一个非常罕见的执照，那就意味着你可以很容易地被录用，这并不一定意味着你很棒。

I literally ground through 200 people. We put them all on a spreadsheet, and I and the recruiter I work with contacted every one of those 200 people and had a conversation with all of them. So, you just have to grind through stuff.

我真的是从200人中钻出来的。我们把它们都放在一个电子表格上，我和我工作的招聘人员联系了这200人中的每一个人，并与他们所有人进行了交谈。所以，你只要把东西磨碎就行了。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。

It's hard work doing a startup, huh?

创业很辛苦，是吧？

Elad Gil: That's why I'm taking a break.

这就是为什么我要休息。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, right.

杰夫·拉斯顿：对，对。

There's so much I want to talk about. We'll do it ...

我想谈的太多了。我们会做的.。

I have a few more things, and then we'll open it up for questions. You sort of already answered this a little bit, but maybe you can elaborate on your decision process when you're looking at an investment.

我还有几件事，然后我们再开始问题。你已经回答了一点，但也许你可以在投资的时候详细说明你的决策过程。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I think I have three really simple criteria.

我想我有三个非常简单的标准。

They're going to sound very generic, but I think about them deeply, hopefully.

它们听起来很通用，但我很想一想，希望如此。

The first one is market, or product market is a better way to phrase it.

第一个是市场，或者说产品市场是一个更好的表达方式。

Is the team building something that the product will actually want or need? There's different ways to check that.

团队所构建的是产品真正想要或需要的东西吗？有不同的方法来检查。

It could be something that I would have used myself at my company.

这可能是我在公司里用过的东西。

It could be you see clear growth or traction from something that's launched, or sometimes I'll literally call potential customers and ask them.

这可能是你从发布的东西中看到了明显的增长或牵引力，或者有时我会直接打电话给潜在的客户并询问他们。

I actually do have a lot of market diligence for things I invest in even though I'm just an angel.

事实上，即使我只是个天使，我对投资的东西也有很多的市场勤奋。

The second thing is are they people who are very high caliber, they can learn quickly, all the rest of it? There is the founder of component, which I think is really important.

第二件事是，他们是高素质的人，他们可以很快地学习，其余的呢？有一个组件的创始人，我认为这是非常重要的。

I just think the market dominates that.

我只是觉得市场主导了这一切。

Then lastly, if they were to call me at 10:00 at night on a Friday or Saturday night, would I take the call, and would I be excited to talk with them? Are they good people? Are they ethical? Would they be easy to work with? Because life is short, and there's lots of companies that'll work.

最后，如果他们在周五或周六晚上10：00给我打电话，我会接电话吗？他们是好人吗？他们有道德吗？和他们一起工作会很容易吗？因为生命是短暂的，而且有很多公司会工作。

The last thing you want is a long conversation with somebody terrible.
Speaker 2: [inaudible]

你最不想和一个可怕的人长篇大论。演讲者2：[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: That's true. What are the things you see, excuse me, companies doing wrong when they come and meet with you?

杰夫·拉斯顿：那是真的。请问，公司来见你的时候做错了什么？

Elad Gil: Good question.

Elad Gil：好问题。

I think it's a few things. One is not getting down to the details quickly enough. Sometimes people will have the preamble of their personal story, how when they were seven, they lived in Canada.

我觉得有几件事。一个是没有足够快地深入到细节上来。有时人们会有他们个人故事的序言，当他们七岁的时候，他们是如何生活在加拿大的。

Then they were nine.

那时他们才九岁。

Then they were 11, and they started learning to write code.

当他们11岁时，他们开始学习编写代码。

Then something else happened.

然后发生了其他事情。

Then eventually they came up with the idea in college, but they didn't work on it for seven years while ...

最后，他们在大学里想出了这个主意，但他们七年来一直没有想过.

I would just make it a very crisp, concise story.

我只想让它成为一个非常清晰，简洁的故事。

This is what we're building.

这就是我们要建造的。

This is why we're building.

这就是为什么我们要建造。

This is who I am, but here are the three highlights. Here's who my co-founders are. Here's the market that we're in. Here's a product we're building. Let's show you a demo.

这就是我的身份，但这是三大亮点。这是我的联合创始人。这是我们的市场。这是我们正在生产的产品。让我们给你看个演示。

That would be sort of the optimal early-stage conversation because the demo means they actually built something instead of just talked about it.

这将是最理想的早期对话，因为演示意味着他们实际上构建了一些东西，而不是仅仅谈论它。

The quick analysis of the market/how does this fit in or what's the use case is really important because they've thought through that dynamic.

对市场的快速分析/如何适应或者用例是非常重要的，因为他们已经考虑过这种动态。

Then the team, who are you, what do you care about, why are you building this is important, versus I was seven in the Appalachian Mountains ...

那么团队，你是谁，你关心什么，你为什么要建造这个很重要的东西，而我在阿巴拉契亚山脉只有七岁.

Geoff Ralston: Get to the point, in other words.

杰夫·拉斯顿：说到重点，换句话说。

Elad Gil: Yeah. Get to the point quickly and also make efficient use of time.

是的。快速地说出要点，并有效地利用时间。

If the meeting should only take 20 minutes, that's great. What I've found is that very busy people will spend more time with you if you're very efficient with their time because they don't feel that you're just going to sit there and take up the time because they can.

如果会议只需要20分钟，那就太好了。我发现，非常忙碌的人会花更多的时间和你在一起，如果你对他们的时间很有效率，因为他们不觉得你只是坐在那里，占用时间，因为他们可以。

I've had meetings where ...

我开过会.

I'll tell you one example meeting, which I thought was amazing, and I didn't think it would happen.

我会给大家举个例子，我认为这是令人惊奇的，但我没想到它会发生。

I was looking into funding things and anti-aging or longevity-related technologies.

我在研究资助一些东西和抗衰老或长寿相关的技术。

I think it's a big gap in biopharma, and I think it's important socially.

我认为这是一个巨大的差距在生物harma，我认为这是重要的社会。

There is this founder, Ben [Caymans] , who I met with. We had, I think, 45 minutes set up, and we talked for 10 minutes.

有个创办人，本[开曼]，我见过他。我想，我们已经安排了45分钟，我们聊了10分钟。

At the end of 10 minutes, he said, "Okay, I got everything I need out of you.

在10分钟结束时，他说：“好吧，我从你这里得到了我需要的一切。

I'm going to go think about this stuff, and then I'll follow up in four days." I was like, "Okay, this guy is just going to disappear." Like, nobody does a 10 minute meeting and actually comes back with anything useful.

我要去想一想，然后四天后我会跟进。我说，“好吧，这家伙就会消失。”比如，没有人会开10分钟的会，然后回来拿出任何有用的东西。

Then, he came back in four days with this big analysis of everything that we'd discussed, and what he was going to do next, and how he was going to approach it.

然后，四天后，他回来了，对我们讨论过的每一件事都做了大量的分析，接下来他要做什么，以及他将如何处理这个问题。

That was a 15, 20 minute meeting.

那是一次15到20分钟的会议。

I was like, "Oh my gosh, this person is amazing.

我说，“天哪，这个人太棒了。

They're extremely efficient.

他们效率极高。

They have amazing follow through.

他们有惊人的跟进能力。

They say what they're going to do, and they do it.

他们说他们要做什么，然后他们就做了。

They realize that this is a multi-interaction thing, and therefore, how do I build that confidence in that person that they actually want to keep talking to me?

他们意识到这是一个多方面的互动，因此，我如何在他们真正想要和我交谈的那个人身上建立起信心呢？

Geoff Ralston: That's a great lesson for future investors, too, huh?

杰夫·拉斯顿：对未来的投资者来说，这也是一个很好的教训，对吧？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

Geoff Ralston: Act like that.

杰夫·拉斯顿：表现得像那样。

I want to turn over to Q&A. But just before we do that, you just wrote a book, High Growth Handbook, which I think is a fantastic book. Maybe not so relevant to running a startup, although it seems like there's a way to sort of track back from all the lessons in there, and it helps you think about your startup, I think, in an effective way.

我想交给问答，但就在我们这么做之前，你刚刚写了一本书，“高增长手册”，我认为这是一本很棒的书。也许与创业没有太大关系，尽管似乎有一种方法可以从其中的所有教训中追溯回来，而且我认为，它可以帮助你有效地思考你的创业。

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

The book is called the High Growth Handbook, and it's basically almost like a section-by-section view of a lot of the common things that happen in startups and then tactically what to do about them.

这本书被称为“高增长手册”，它基本上就像一个接一个的观点，很多常见的事情发生在初创企业，然后在战术上如何处理它们。

It's a very tactical book that doesn't have a lot of platitudes. Like, there's nothing about A players hiring A players, which doesn't really help anybody.

这是一本很有策略的书，没有太多陈词滥调。就像，一名球员雇佣一名球员没有任何意义，这对任何人都没有真正的帮助。

It's not like somebody's going to write, "I'm an A player," on their resume. But it really helps you understand, okay, you want to build a recruiting process. What's the multi-step process you should build, and how should you go about doing it? Then it's interwoven with interviews with Sam from YC, and Claire Hughes Johnson from Stripe, and Marc Andreessen, and Reid Hoffman, and Rajen Sanghvi, and a bunch of other people around their experiences operating or funding companies that are relevant to each section. So, there'll be a section on board, and then there'll be an interview with Reid Hoffman around what he looks for in board members. He just wrote Blitzscaling, which is sort of a really interesting book around scaling companies that I definitely recommend as well.

这并不是说有人会在他们的简历上写“我是一个A球员”。但它确实帮助你理解，好吧，你想建立一个招聘程序。你应该构建什么多步过程，你应该如何去做呢？然后是与来自YC的Sam，Stripe的Claire Hughes Johnson，Marc Andreessen，Reid Hoffman，Rajen Sanghvi，以及其他一些人的访谈交织在一起，他们的经验是经营或资助与每个部门相关的公司。所以，飞机上会有一个章节，然后会对里德·霍夫曼(Reid Hoffman)进行一次关于他在董事会成员中寻找什么的采访。他刚刚写了“闪电战”，这是一本非常有趣的关于公司规模的书，我肯定也会推荐这本书。

The interesting thing is, though, that a number of the sections in the book actually started off as blog posts on my blog. Some of them are actually targeted to early-stage founders, so some of the stuff around hiring maps into it, or some of the stuff around product management maps into it.

有趣的是，书中的一些章节实际上是以博客的形式在我的博客上开始的。他们中的一些人实际上是针对早期创始人的，所以其中一些是关于雇佣地图的东西，或者是关于产品管理的地图。

I do think there are some things that are universal and then, to your point, some things that are completely divorced, like buying a company, or raising $100 million, or whatever it is, or obviously for much later stages or doing a big reorg, things like that.

我确实认为有些事情是普遍的，然后，在你看来，有些事情是完全离婚的，比如收购一家公司，或者筹集1亿美元，或者不管是什么，或者很明显在后期阶段，或者做一次大的重组，诸如此类的事情。

Geoff Ralston: But the way the book is structured, it turns out it's easy to skip around. So, you should buy the book ...

杰夫·拉斯顿：但这本书的结构方式很容易跳过。所以你应该买这本书.。

Elad Gil: Oh, thanks.

埃尔德·吉尔：噢，谢谢。

Geoff Ralston: ...

杰夫·拉斯顿：.。

And find the parts you like. Let's open to Q&A, questions for Elad.
Speaker 4: This question's about investor updates.

找到你喜欢的部分。让我们开始问答吧，给Elad的问题。演讲者4：这个问题是关于投资者的最新情况。

A company that has long sale cycle, let's say four or five months ... What should be the frequency for the initial date, and then what should be put in that initial date? Because now [inaudible]

一个销售周期很长的公司，比如说四五个月.初始日期的频率应该是多少？因为现在[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: I'll repeat the question.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我会重复这个问题。

The question is about investor updates. How frequent should they be, and what should be in them?

问题在于投资者的最新情况。他们应该有多频繁，他们应该是什么？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I have a blog post I actually wrote on this, and I think that you should do it monthly. My suggestion in terms of the sections would be the top section should be what are your asks from your investors, or investors and advisors, or whoever you're sending it to, so it's very clear immediately how they can help.

我在博客上写了一篇文章，我认为你应该每月写一篇。我的建议是，最重要的部分应该是你的投资者、投资者和顾问，或者是你发送给谁的问题，所以很清楚他们能提供什么帮助。

If they don't read anything else, if they just open the email, they'll see that, and you'll actually get a lot of responses to that.

如果他们不读其他的东西，如果他们打开电子邮件，他们就会看到，你会收到很多回复。

I think the second section could be metrics, if you have metrics.

我认为第二部分可以是度量，如果有度量的话。

It could be sales.

可能是销售。

It could be that it's flat, and that's fine. Right? I think burn is important to include, so how much money do you have left? Paul Graham often advocates for default dead or default alive.

可能是它是平的，这很好。对吗？我认为烧伤很重要，所以你还剩下多少钱？保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)经常主张违约、死亡或活着违约。

Are you going to run out of money at some point or not? I often just phrase it similarly as like how many months of cash do you have left, and how much are you burning? Then, you can have updates around team, around market, et cetera, or product. Did you launch anything new? Press ... Did you get any? I think you can follow that.

你会在某个时候用完钱吗？我经常这样说，就像你还剩多少个月的现金，你还在烧多少钱？然后，您可以在团队、市场、等等或产品周围进行更新。有什么新消息吗？新闻.。你有拿到吗？我想你能理解。

The reason I think monthly is important is you want to create high enough frequency that your investors are thinking about you and that they feel that they're up to speed on things, but not so much that it overwhelms you or them.

我认为每月一次很重要的原因是你想要创造出足够高的频率，让你的投资者思考你，让他们觉得他们能跟上速度，但不想让你或他们不知所措。

I think monthly is a nice cadence.

我觉得月刊节奏不错。

At Color, we started sending out investor updates really early.

在Color，我们很早就开始发送投资者的最新信息。

I'd call up an investor, and I'd start to give them background in terms of what's been happening.

我会打电话给一个投资者，我会开始给他们提供关于发生了什么的背景信息。

They'd say, "No, no, no.

他们会说，“不，不。

I read your update.

我看了你的最新消息。

I know what's going on. Let's jump straight to it." By being very transparent, it actually helped immensely in terms of not spending the first 20 minutes getting people up to speed, but every investor call suddenly was very efficient.

我知道怎么回事。让我们直截了当地说：“通过非常透明的方式，它实际上在没有花费前20分钟让人们跟上速度方面起到了很大的作用，但是每个投资者的电话都突然变得非常高效。

And they love the transparency because they feel like they're part of the company and the team and that you're open with them.

他们喜欢透明度，因为他们觉得自己是公司和团队的一员，你对他们敞开心扉。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Speaker 5: So, you're a big proponent of the market-first investment strategy. How did you evaluate an obvious market like Airbnb back in 2010? How did you evaluate that market opportunity when it wasn't public?

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的。演讲者5：那么，你是市场优先投资策略的有力支持者。2010年，你是如何评价Airbnb这样一个显而易见的市场的？当市场机会不是公开的时候，你是如何评价它的？

Geoff Ralston: The question is about market opportunities. Since Elad cares most about that, how do you evaluate opportunities that are not obvious, like Airbnb?

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题在于市场机会。既然Elad最关心这个问题，你如何评价那些不太明显的机会，比如Airbnb？

Elad Gil: Yeah.

是的。

I invested in a versus their A versus their seed.

我投资了他们的A对他们的种子。

I'm guessing the seed was harder.

我猜种子会更硬。

I think at their A, they had pretty clear traction.

我认为在他们的A，他们有相当明显的牵引力。

I mean, they were growing at a good clip.

我是说，它们长得很好。

Then, the other side of it was I had actually traveled on a service called Servas, which ...

然后，它的另一面是，我实际上是在一个叫Servas的服务上旅行的，这个服务.

After World War II, the Esperanto community thought that one way to encourage world peace was to let people stay with each other for free. You'd apply to be a traveler, and they'd literally give you ... You do interviews, and then they give you these little booklets.

二战后，世界语社团认为，鼓励世界和平的一种方法是让人们自由相处。你会申请成为一个旅行者，他们真的会给你.你做采访，然后他们给你这些小册子。

If you're traveling to Italy, it'd list everybody in Italy who would be willing to host you, and their phone number, and how to contact them. You'd literally call random strangers up or email them and say, "Hey, can I stay with you, and how long can I stay with you?" And you stayed with them for free.

如果你要去意大利旅行，它会列出意大利所有愿意接待你的人，以及他们的电话号码，以及如何联系他们。你会给陌生人打电话或发电子邮件说：“嘿，我能和你在一起吗？我能和你在一起多久？”你免费和他们住在一起。

I traveled on a very similar service throughout Europe, so for me it was a no-brainer.

我在欧洲各地都有类似的服务，所以对我来说，这是一件轻而易举的事。

I thought, wow, you can monetize this.

我想，哇，你可以把这个赚钱了。

The most expensive asset that a person has as their home.

一个人拥有的最昂贵的资产作为他们的家。

If you can help people monetize their homes and make a lot of money off of it, it actually felt like a no-brainer. But part of that was driven experientially, and then part of it was it was working.

如果你能帮助人们赚钱并从中赚到很多钱，那你就会觉得自己是个不需要思考的人。但其中的一部分是经验驱动的，然后其中的一部分起作用了。

Geoff Ralston: More questions. Yeah, back there.
Speaker 6: Can you talk about doing due diligence on investors with the bad piece, what things can go wrong, didn't go right? Because investors are not going to do that [inaudible]

杰夫·拉斯顿：更多的问题。是的，在后面。演讲者6：你能谈谈对投资者做尽职调查的问题吗？有什么事情可能出错，哪些事情不正确？因为投资者不会这么做[听不见]

Elad Gil: Yeah, I would basically-

Elad Gil：是的，我基本上-

Geoff Ralston: The question is about can you talk about due diligence on investors who necessarily give you a bad reference?

杰夫·拉斯顿：问题是，你能不能谈谈投资者的尽职调查，因为他们一定会给你一个糟糕的推荐信？

Elad Gil: Yeah, I think it's ...

爱拉德·吉尔：是的，我想是.

I would just look ... Most of them will have a list of investments either on their website or on AngelList or Crunchbase, and so I would just ...

我只想看看.。他们中的大多数人都会在他们的网站上，或者在AngelList或者Crunchbase上有一份投资清单，所以我只想.

If you're part of YC, I think there's a Bookface, which has all sorts of information.

如果你是YC的一员，我想有一个书脸，它有各种各样的信息。

Geoff Ralston: We have an investor database, yeah.

杰夫·拉斯顿：是的，我们有一个投资者数据库。

Elad Gil: They have an investor database, so you can actually see what everybody says about them.

Elad Gil：他们有一个投资者数据库，所以你可以看到每个人对他们的评价。

Geoff Ralston: Elad has a good grade.

杰夫·拉斯顿：埃拉德的成绩很好。

Elad Gil: Hopefully.

希望如此。

I would just look at that list and then call the two or three things that you'd never heard of, or that shut down, or were small acquisitions, or whatever it may be.

我会看一下清单，然后把你从来没听说过的两到三件事叫做“关闭”，或者“小收购”，或者其他任何事情。

I mean, sometimes you'll call a successful company, too, and they'll say, "I'll never work with this person again." I know one company ... You can actually see it. Say that somebody's exits their company for a billion dollars.

我的意思是，有时候你也会打电话给一家成功的公司，他们会说，“我再也不会和这个人一起工作了。”我知道一家公司.。你真的可以看到。说有人为了10亿美元离开了他们的公司。

Then they start another company, and in no rounds do they take their prior investors.

然后，他们开始另一家公司，在任何一轮，他们都不会带走他们的先前的投资者。

That's usually a sign, and so I would call up that person.
Speaker 7: My question is about pricing.

这通常是个信号，所以我会打电话给那个人。演讲者7：我的问题是关于定价的。

As part of product market fit, I feel like right now we're looking at pricing market fit.

作为产品市场匹配的一部分，我觉得现在我们正在研究定价市场匹配。

Anything that you can share about pricing journey with your companies or what you advise CEOs?

你能和你的公司分享任何关于定价过程的信息，或者你对首席执行官们的建议吗？

Geoff Ralston: Any advice on pricing?

杰夫·拉斯顿：对定价有什么建议吗？

Elad Gil: Yeah. Marc Andreessen has this great quote, which ...

是的。马克·安德烈森有句名言。

If he had to tell startup founders one thing, I think he says that he would tell them to raise prices.

如果他不得不告诉初创公司创始人一件事，我想他会告诉他们要提高价格。

I think in general, especially technology-driven companies tend to really under price their product under the belief that if they price it really low, it'll get them more market share more rapidly, and therefore, they'll win the market. When in reality, they've never run the experiment, and it's really easy to drop prices.

我认为总体来说，特别是技术驱动的公司往往会降低产品的价格，因为他们相信，如果价格真的很低，他们就能更快地获得更多的市场份额，从而赢得市场。在现实中，他们从来没有做过这样的实验，而且很容易降价。

Geoff Ralston: And really hard to raise them.

杰夫·拉斯顿：而且真的很难抚养他们。

Elad Gil: And it's very hard to raise them.

Elad Gil：抚养他们很难。

I do think that people also overthink pricing and the changes and the impact of them when they have small populations.

我确实认为，当人口较少时，人们也会过度考虑定价、变化及其影响。

If you have 100 customers that are all small customers, and you raise prices and piss them off, that's okay.

如果你有100个客户都是小客户，你提高价格并激怒他们，那没关系。

I mean, you have to do it nicely, or maybe your grandfather them in.

我是说，你必须做的很好，或者你的祖父也可以。

There's all sorts of ways you can do it the right way. But I'm just saying it's not an existential moment for the company, unlike if you have 100,000 customers, or you have giant enterprises using you, and you're going into these deep negotiations.

有各种各样的方法你可以用正确的方式去做。但我只是想说，对公司来说，这不是一个生存的时刻，不像你有10万客户，或者你有大型企业在使用你，而你正在进行这些深入的谈判。

I think when you have a very small base, you can actually experiment. You can A/B test things. You can do all sorts of things. But in general, I would start on the high end unless your strategy is explicitly to go for market share and there's a reason for doing that.

我认为当你有一个很小的基地，你实际上可以实验。你可以做A/B测试。你可以做各种各样的事情。但总的来说，我会从高端开始，除非你的战略是明确地追求市场份额，而这样做是有原因的。

There are certain markets where that's very important. Certain areas where you really are generating a data asset, those may be places where you want to have low pricing. Often people will just look at their competitors' websites and say, "Oh, they're charging 9.99 a month.

在某些市场，这是非常重要的。某些领域，你真正产生的数据资产，这些地方，你可能希望有低的价格。人们常常只看竞争对手的网站就会说：“哦，他们每月收费9.99英镑。

I should, too." But often that company hasn't really thought anything through either, unless they're a older or more sophisticated company. So again, I think I would just sort of start from scratch.

我也应该这样做。“但通常情况下，这家公司也没有真正考虑过任何事情，除非他们是一家更老、更老练的公司。所以，我想我还是从零开始吧。”

There's long things around are you doing value-based pricing or cost-based pricing or ...

有很长一段时间你是在做基于价值的定价还是基于成本的定价或者.

There's different ways to price products.

有不同的方式为产品定价。

I think Michael Dearing has a great online tutorial, which I would definitely look up. You can do a search for it, like Michael Dearing pricing, and there will be a variety of different segments and approaches.

我认为迈克尔迪林有一个很好的在线教程，我肯定会查。你可以搜索它，像迈克尔迪林定价，将有各种不同的部分和方法。

The other thing you could do on the pricing side is good, better, best is a common framework. You have a base product, you have an intermediate product, and then you have the high-end product.

在定价方面你可以做的另一件事是好的，更好的，最好的是一个共同的框架。你有一个基础产品，一个中间产品，然后是高端产品。

The high-end product exists largely so that people buy the intermediate product.

高端产品的大量存在使得人们购买中间产品.

There's all sorts of pricing tactics that tend to work.
Speaker 7: Thank you.
Speaker 8: Yeah. When you are looking for a [inaudible] consumer company, product company.

有各种各样的定价策略是可行的。发言者7：谢谢。演讲者8：是的。当你寻找一个[听不到的]消费公司，产品公司。

In the beginning, you find it difficult to identify if it's a good product with a bad marketing strategy or communication strategy. Or maybe the content inside the problem that maybe is not fitting the customers right. How do you talk about and identify that problem to see if you have a good product with a bad strategy or a bad product?

在一开始，你发现很难确定它是一个好产品，一个糟糕的营销策略或沟通策略。或者可能是问题里面的内容不适合客户。你如何谈论和识别这个问题，看看你是否有一个好的产品，一个坏的策略或一个坏的产品？

Geoff Ralston: I think the question is around, especially in consumer markets, how can you tell what's wrong with the product? Is it your strategy, or is it the content? Or is it some feature of the product that's missing?

杰夫·拉斯顿：我认为问题就在这里，尤其是在消费市场，你怎么知道产品出了什么问题？是你的策略，还是内容？或者是产品的某些特性缺失了？

Elad Gil: It depends a little bit on what type of consumer product it is.

EladGil：这在一定程度上取决于它是什么类型的消费品。

If you have an e-commerce site, it really is about LTV and CAC. Can you acquire customers at a cost less than what you sell the product to them, and what's the lifetime value of that customer? There, there's a very small handful of distribution strategies that tend to work, be it SEO or SEM or other types of either ad formats or customer acquisition strategies.

如果你有一个电子商务网站，它真的是关于ltv和cac的。你能以比你卖给他们的产品更低的成本来获得客户吗？这个客户的终身价值是多少？在那里，有一小部分分销策略，往往是可行的，无论是SEO或SEM或其他类型的广告格式或客户获取策略。

If it's more of a social network, then really it's looking at growth rates, and churn, and what are the vectors by which you're pulling people into the product? So, it can get ...

如果说它更像是一个社交网络，那么它实际上是在研究增长率和流动性，以及你将人们带入产品的媒介是什么？所以它可以.。

I think there's a dozen different answers depending on the market segment.

我认为有十几个不同的答案取决于市场细分。

Andrew Chen has some really good blog posts, I think, about some of this stuff, so that may be a good reference to go look up.

陈国强有一些非常好的博客文章，我认为，关于这些东西，所以这可能是一个很好的参考去查阅。

Geoff Ralston: Okay, one more question. Back there.
Speaker 9: In terms of product market fit, what do you consider a real or a fake wall?

杰夫·拉斯顿：好的，还有一个问题。后面。扬声器9：就产品市场的适合性而言，你认为真正的或假的墙是什么？

Geoff Ralston: In terms of product market fit, what do you consider ... Or, how can you tell the difference between an actual wall where you're about to get smashed or a fake wall that you should smash through?

杰夫·拉斯顿：在产品市场上，你认为.或者，你怎么能分辨出你将要被砸碎的一堵真正的墙和一堵你应该打破的假墙之间的区别呢？

Elad Gil: I think every startup that succeeds has fake walls. So, to some extent, I think it's back to the discussion we had earlier, which is what is a sign that your product's actually working? And it depends on what you mean by a wall in terms of ... For example, if you're growing 20% a month off a small base, I think that's a sign that it's working. Even though people may say, "Oh, you have a small user base. You're hitting a wall because you're never going to get that big." Then you see these companies become giant companies because the use case is much broader.

Elad Gil：我认为每一家成功的初创公司都有假墙。所以，在某种程度上，我认为这又回到了我们之前的讨论，这是你的产品真正起作用的一个迹象吗？这取决于你所说的墙在.例如，如果你每月从一个很小的基础上增长20%，我认为这是一个信号，表明它正在起作用。尽管人们可能会说，“哦，你的用户基数很小，你撞到墙了，因为你永远不会有那么大的用户。”然后你会看到这些公司变成了巨大的公司，因为用例要广泛得多。

Airbnb is a good example where I think that market size was bigger than anybody expected. So, it depends a little bit on what sort of wall you're talking about, but I do think there are clear signs that something is going to work. Often they're ignored by the founders themselves because it's just such a leap of faith to think this small, delicate thing that you're working on that's very breakable will actually turn into this amazing, giant company.

Airbnb就是一个很好的例子，我认为市场规模比任何人预期的都要大。所以，这在一定程度上取决于你说的是什么类型的墙，但我确实认为有明显的迹象表明某些东西会起作用。他们常常被创始人自己忽视，因为你认为你正在做的这件很容易破碎的小事情实际上会变成一家令人惊叹的、巨大的公司，这是一种信念的飞跃。

That actually happened to me when I went to Airbnb's Christmas party a few years ago.

几年前我参加Airbnb的圣诞派对时，我确实遇到了这种情况。

I invested when it was about eight people.

我投资的时候大约有八个人。

Then I went to the Christmas party and there was like, I don't remember how many, 2,000 people or whatever the number was at that time, dressed in suits.

然后我去参加圣诞派对，当时我不记得有多少人，2000人，或者当时穿西服的人数。

It looked extremely like a very nice corporate holiday event.

它看起来非常像一个非常好的公司假日活动。

I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."

我说，“哦，天哪，这太棒了。”

Geoff Ralston: What happened?

杰夫·拉斯顿：怎么回事？

Elad Gil: No, it was one of those moments where you're like, wow, this really happens. You can go from eight people to thousands over a couple of years and build a substantial institution that's going to survive potentially generationally.

Elad Gil：不，那是你想，哇，这种事情真的发生的时刻之一。在过去的几年里，你可以从八个人到几千人，建立一个庞大的机构，这个机构可能会在一代人的时间里存活下来。

That's very powerful.

那是非常强大的。

Geoff Ralston: Elad, thank you very much.

杰夫·拉斯顿：埃拉德，非常感谢你。

Elad Gil: Ah, thanks for having me.


埃尔德·吉尔：啊，谢谢你邀请我。
