# How to Succeed with a Startup

Sam Altman: Today I'm gonna talk about how to succeed with a startup, obviously more than can  be said here in 20 minutes, but I will do the best I can. The  most important thing, the number one lesson we try to teach startups is that, the  degree to which your successful, approximates the degree to which you build a product that  is so good people spontaneously tell their friends about it.

Sam Altman:今天我要讲的是如何在创业中取得成功，很明显，在20分钟内我会在这里说得更多，但我会尽我所能。最重要的是，我们试着给初创企业上的第一课是，你成功的程度，接近于你制造出一种如此优秀的产品的程度-人们自发地告诉他们的朋友。

Startups always ask us for  the secret to success. They always want to believe it's something other than this, because  this is really hard to do. But this is it. If you can build a  product that is so good, people spontaneously tell their friends about it, you have done  80% of the work that you need to be a really successful startup. If you  think about the most successful companies, you know Google, Facebook, whatever, you probably found out  about them because a friend of yours said, you got to try this, it's great.  So this is the bar.

创业公司总是问我们成功的秘诀。他们总想相信这不是什么，因为这真的很难做到。但就是这样。如果你能制造出一种非常好的产品，人们会自发地告诉他们的朋友，你已经完成了80%的工作，你需要成为一个真正成功的创业公司。如果你想到最成功的公司，你知道谷歌，Facebook，不管怎样，你可能会发现他们，因为你的一个朋友说，你得试试这个，这很棒。这就是酒吧。

Something that people love so much, they tell their friends  about it. One important indicator for a product like that is, a product that's simple  to explain, an easy to understand. If you can't explain in a few words what  you do, and if at least some people don't say, "Oh, that's pretty interesting.", that's  usually a mistake. It's usually a sign of unclear thinking, or a need that is  not big enough.

一些人们非常喜欢的东西，他们会告诉他们的朋友。像这样的产品的一个重要指标是，一个简单易懂的产品。如果你不能用几句话来解释你在做什么，而且至少有些人不会说，“哦，这很有趣。”，这通常是个错误。这通常是一种思维不清的迹象，或者是一种不够大的需求。

Another thing that startups need to look for is, a market that  is either started to undergo, or is soon gonna undergo exponential growth. I think this  is actually related to one of the biggest mistakes investors make when evaluating startups. Investors  always say, well, what's your growth rate? We care about the growth rate. Investors will  forgive smallest revenue today, if it's growing quickly. For some reason, people don't think about  markets this way. But if you think about the most important startups, they are the  ones that start in small markets, that are growing very, very quickly. 11 years ago,  the market for iPhone apps was $0, it's now huge.

创业公司需要寻找的另一件事是，一个要么开始经历，要么即将经历指数增长的市场。我认为这实际上与投资者在评估初创企业时犯的最大错误之一有关。投资者总是说，你的增长率是多少？我们关心增长率。今天，如果收入增长迅速，投资者会原谅最小的收入。出于某种原因，人们不这样看待市场。但如果你想想最重要的初创公司，它们是从小市场起步的，它们的增长非常快。11年前，iPhone应用的市场是0美元，现在已经很大了。

And I think if you  only think about the tam today, you'll make a big mistake. What you really want  to do is identify a market that's gonna grow every year, and be able to  ride that up elevator.

我认为如果你只想到今天的问题，你就会犯大错。你真正想要做的是找出一个每年都会增长的市场，并且能够骑上电梯。

A really important thing to figuring this out is, learning how  to differentiate between real trends and fake trends.

要弄清楚这一点，一个非常重要的事情是，学习如何区分真实趋势和假趋势。

A real trend is something that's actually  gonna happen, and the fake trend is not, or at least not yet. Before you  make a big bet on a new platform, you want to make sure it's real.  Now there's an easy trick for this, which I'll share now. Real trends are ones  where a new technology platform comes along, and the early adopters use it obsessively, and  tell their friends how much they love it.

一个真正的趋势实际上是会发生的，而假趋势不是，或者至少现在还没有。在你对一个新平台下大赌注之前，你要确保它是真实的。现在有一个简单的窍门，我现在要和大家分享。真正的趋势是出现了一个新的技术平台，而早期的采用者痴迷地使用它，并告诉他们的朋友他们有多喜欢它。

A fake trend is one where, people  may buy the product but don't use it, or at least not enough.

假冒伪劣的趋势是，人们可能会购买该产品，但不使用它，或至少不够。

So an  example of a real trend, I already mentioned the iPhone, I'll mention that again. When  the iPhone first came out, many people were dismissive, because they only sold a million  or 2 million that year.

一个真实趋势的例子，我已经提到了iPhone，我会再提一次。当iPhone第一次问世时，许多人对此不屑一顾，因为当年他们只卖出了100万或200万部。

And they said, well, this just doesn't matter. But for  the people that had an iPhone, they used it for hours every day. It became  central to their lives. They loved it. They told their friends you've got to get  one. I think it was obvious then to people paying attention, that something had fundamentally  shifted.

他们说，好吧，这不重要。但是对于那些有iPhone的人来说，他们每天使用它几个小时。它成为他们生活的中心。他们很喜欢。他们告诉他们的朋友你得找一个。我认为，对于那些关注的人来说，很明显，事情已经发生了根本的变化。

And we had a new computing platform, that was gonna spawn huge businesses.

我们有了一个新的计算平台，这个平台将催生巨大的商业。

And  it was a good time to bet on mobile apps.

这是一个在移动应用上下注的好时机。

A fake trend or, at  least a fake trend as of, August 2018, I would say is VR. I do  believe VR will be big someday, but today most people that I know that own  a VR headset use it never, or very rarely.

一个假趋势，或至少是假趋势，2018年8月，我想说是虚拟现实。我确实相信有一天VR会很大，但是今天大多数我知道拥有VR耳机的人从来不使用它，或者很少使用它。

And so, although a lot of  people talk about it, and maybe even a lot of people buy them, there's not  the intense usage per user among the early adopters, that I think you want to  see before you make a big bet.

所以，尽管很多人都在谈论这个问题，甚至很多人都会买，但在早期的用户中，每个用户的使用率并不高，我认为在你下大注之前，你想看一下。

Another thing that startups need, at least one  evangelical founder, usually the CEO.

创业公司需要的另一件事，至少有一位福音派的创始人，通常是首席执行官。

Someone at the startup has got to be the person  that is gonna recruit, sell the product, talk to the press, raise money. This requires  someone who can infect with enthusiasm, the whole world about what the company is trying  to do.

创业公司的人必须是要招募、销售产品、接受媒体采访、筹集资金的人。这就需要一个能感染整个世界的热情的人来了解公司正在努力做的事情。

And someone who becomes the chief evangelist for the company, it's very hard  to succeed wildly without that. It's very hard to build a team at all without  being able to do that. One thing that helps for this is, having an ambitious  vision. You never want to be grandiose that turns people off, but you want to  let yourself grow more ambitious over time.

而成为公司首席传道士的人，如果没有这一点，就很难疯狂地成功。在没有能力的情况下，要建立一个团队是非常困难的。对此有帮助的一件事是，有一个雄心勃勃的愿景。你从来不想成为让人讨厌的大人物，但你想让自己随着时间的推移而变得更加雄心勃勃。

And as long as you do that organically,  people will respond.

只要你有机地去做，人们就会做出反应。

Ambitious visions are exciting, they're fun to work on. In fact, I  think in 2018, at least in Silicon Valley, it's easier to start a hard startup  than it is to start an easy startup. Now, this sounds paradoxical, but ambitious projects  are interesting. In the current environment, it may be relatively easy to raise capital, but  it's really hard to do everything else. There's so many startups. It's so easy to  start one, they all sound so promising, that bringing it together enough talent in one  organization is really hard to do.

雄心勃勃的愿景是令人兴奋的，他们是有趣的工作。事实上，我认为2018年，至少在硅谷，启动一家艰难的公司要比启动一家简单的公司容易得多。现在，这听起来有些矛盾，但雄心勃勃的项目很有趣。在目前的环境下，筹集资金可能相对容易，但其他事情都很难做到。创业公司太多了。启动一家公司是如此容易，它们听起来都很有希望，以至于在一个组织中把足够的人才聚集在一起真的很难做到。

And if you're working on a problem that may  be modestly successful, it's easy to get the first few people to join. You can  give them a lot of equity. But then it gets really hard. Why is employee  20 gonna join? Why does this matter to the world? Why should someone work on  your startup versus any of the other things they could do? And picking something that  matters if you're successful, is a great way to do that.

如果你正在努力解决一个成功的问题，那么很容易让最初的几个人加入你的行列。你可以给他们很多股权。但之后就变得很难了。为什么20号员工要加入？为什么这对世界来说很重要？为什么有人应该在你的创业公司工作，而不是他们能做的任何其他事情？如果你成功的话，选择一些重要的东西是一个很好的方法。

And so, I think  it's really important to think about when you were starting the company, how is this  gonna evolve into a vision that a lot of people want to help with, that  a lot of people want to be associated with? Because, I think getting talent and  getting mind share, it's really hard in the current environment.

所以，我认为很重要的是，当你开始创业的时候，这将如何演变成一个很多人都想帮助的愿景，很多人都希望与之联系在一起？因为，我认为在当前的环境下，获得天赋和精神分享是很困难的。

And people are interested in  startups that matter.

人们对那些重要的初创公司很感兴趣。

Another thing that we've noticed among our best founders again, and again  and again, is that they have a confident and definite view of the future. They  may be wrong.

另一件事，我们已经注意到，在我们最好的创始人一次又一次，是他们有一个自信和明确的未来的看法。他们可能错了。

And so we say it's good to be confident and flexible. But  this idea that you are confident and definite, "This is what I think is going  to happen." Or, "This is what is going to happen." and being relatively sure of  that. Having courage of your convictions, being a clear leader saying, "We're gonna do this."  And that's why even in the face of a lot of doubt, that seems to  really correlate with success.

所以我们说自信和灵活是很好的。但是你有信心和明确的想法，“这就是我认为将会发生的事情。”或者，“这就是将要发生的事情。”对此相对肯定。有勇气的信念，作为一个明确的领导者说，“我们要这样做。”这就是为什么即使面对很多疑问，这似乎真的与成功相关。

And this comes back to, having an ambitious vision. But the  entire startup ecosystem is best set up to support companies that have a low chance  of success, but are huge if they work.

这又回到了一个雄心勃勃的愿景。但是，建立整个创业生态系统的最好方式是支持那些成功几率较低、但如果成功就很大的公司。

And I think going for something that  is huge if it works, will attract the best people. I'm not gonna talk too  much about the team. There are a lot of obvious things I could say, that  had been said many times by many people about, you need smart people, who want  to work really hard, and who communicate well. These are all really true, but I'd  like to mention a few non-obvious things that we've noticed, that we don't hear people  say as much.

我认为，如果成功的话，去做一件大事，会吸引到最好的人。我不会说太多关于球队的事。有很多显而易见的事情我可以说，很多人已经说过很多次了，你需要聪明的人，他们想要很努力的工作，并且能很好的沟通。这些都是真的，但我想提一下我们注意到的一些不明显的事情，这些事情我们听不到人们说的那么多。

About the team you need to assemble. [inaudible] says that the team  you build, is the company you build.

关于你需要组建的团队。说你建立的团队，就是你建立的公司。

And I really think that's true. I've still  met only a handful of founders, I think that spend enough time on recruiting. Like  Mark Zuckerberg is famously one of them. But building a great team, I think other  than picking the right market and building a great product, is the most important thing  you do.

我真的认为这是真的。我仍然只见过少数几位创始人，我认为他们在招聘上花了足够的时间。就像马克·扎克伯格一样，他也是其中之一。但是，建立一个伟大的团队，我认为，除了选择正确的市场和建立一个伟大的产品，是最重要的事情，你所做的。

All founders go through a transition, all successful founders, where you switch from  building a product, to building a company, and building a company really is about the  team.

所有的创始人都经历了一个转变，所有成功的创始人，在那里，你从建立一个产品，到建立一个公司，而建立一个公司实际上是关于团队的。

So you need optimists.Thee whole world will be telling you why you're gonna fail  as a startup. If you don't have that internal fire of belief, if you don't  have people who say, "You know what, we are gonna do this, and it doesn't  matter what the haters say. We're gonna figure this out.

所以你需要乐观主义者，你的整个世界都会告诉你为什么你会失败。如果你没有那种内在的信念之火，如果你没有人说，“你知道吗，我们要这么做，不管敌视者怎么说，我们都会弄清楚的。”

And there is this problem,  it must be solvable." If you don't have the spirit of optimism on the team,  it's very hard to succeed when the world continues to punch you in the face.  You need at least some idea generators. There are a handful of people in any  company that has gone on to be really successful, that I've been able to work  with, who are just really good at coming up with lots of ideas. You don't  want too many of these people, because that's more ideas than a company can follow  through on. But, having some people within a company that are just constantly throwing out  new ideas, most of which will be bad, turns out to be super important to  have on the team. This spirit of, "we'll figure it out" is my favorite thing  to hear among early startup team members.

有这个问题，一定是可以解决的。“如果你在团队中没有乐观的精神，当世界继续打你的脸的时候，你很难成功。你至少需要一些创意发生器。在任何一家公司里，都有少数人取得了成功，我能和他们一起工作，他们非常善于想出很多点子。你不会想要太多这样的人，因为这是一个公司无法坚持的想法。但是，在一家公司里有一些人只是不断地提出新的想法，其中大部分都会很糟糕，这对团队来说是非常重要的。这种精神，“我们会解决它”是我最喜欢听到的东西，在早期的创业团队成员。

A lot of things go wrong. The situations  that startups win, intend to be incredibly dynamic.

很多事情都出了问题。初创企业赢得的情况，将是令人难以置信的动态。

And so this idea that, even if  I'm not qualified on paper, even if I haven't solved this problem before, even if  this problem feels like it's gonna kill the company, which many problems will feel that  way. This spirit among the team of, "You know, what? We've got the people we  need. We're gonna figure this out. We're gonna bet this done." That's super important.

所以这个想法，即使我在纸面上没有资格，即使我以前没有解决过这个问题，即使这个问题感觉它会毁掉公司，很多问题都会有这种感觉。这个团队的精神是：“你知道吗？我们已经找到了我们需要的人。我们会解决这个问题的。我们会把这件事做好的。”这太重要了。

Another  thing that I love to hear from early team members is, "I've got it." So  you know, you hear in big companies, a lot of people say, "That's not my  department.

另一件事，我喜欢听到早期的团队成员是，“我有它。”所以你知道，在大公司里，很多人会说，“那不是我的部门。

Someone else is gonna do that." Or you know, "Ooh, this is really bad,  this is gonna hurt us." And you want people who just step up and say,  "I'll do it. I've got it. Don't worry about it." You want people to have  a bias towards action.

其他人会这么做的。“或者你知道，”哦，这真的很糟糕，这会伤害我们。“而你想要的是那些站出来说”我会做的“的人。我有个主意别担心。“你希望人们对行动有偏见。

Startups, especially in their early days, often win by moving very  quickly. You never get as much data as you'd like. You never have as much  time to deliberate as you'd like.

初创企业，尤其是早期的初创企业，往往以非常迅速的速度取胜。你从来没有得到你想要的足够多的数据。你从来没有那么多的时间去考虑你想要的。

And you want people who are willing to act,  with much less data than they like to have, with much less certainty.

你希望人们愿意采取行动，用比他们想要的更少的数据，更少的确定性。

And then  if they act and it doesn't work, they adapt really quickly and try something else.  We talk also about the blessing of inexperience. We have seen many of our startups  do incredible things, because no one told them it was hard. Or no one told  them they can't do it. There's a great quote from Steve Wasniak, about how all  the best things he ever did came from having no experience whatsoever, and having no  money.

然后，如果他们的行为不起作用，他们很快就会适应，并尝试其他的东西。我们也谈论缺乏经验的祝福。我们已经看到我们的许多初创公司做了令人难以置信的事情，因为没有人告诉他们这很困难。或者没人告诉他们做不到。史蒂夫·瓦斯尼亚克(SteveWasniak)有句很好的话说，他做过的所有最好的事情都来自于没有任何经验，也没有钱。

And you know, that obviously is not always true. But there is a magic  thing that happens with startups, especially in the early days, before they've learned they're not  supposed to be able to do certain things.

显然，这并不总是真的。但有一件神奇的事情发生在初创企业身上，尤其是在创业初期，他们还没有意识到自己不应该做某些事情。

And so I think as a startup,  again, it doesn't work to have everybody being inexperienced, but you can take more bets  than you normally would on inexperienced, but super high potential people. That's the end of  the topic on team. One of the most important jobs you have as a founder  is to never lose momentum, and this is a little bit depressing, because it means  for the first few years you never get to take your foot off the gas.  You never get to really rest. We try to be honest about this, that startups  are not the best choice for work life balance at all, but especially in the  early days.

所以我认为，作为一家初创公司，让每个人都缺乏经验并不管用，但你可以比平时更多地押注于缺乏经验、但潜力极高的人。关于团队的话题到此结束。作为一名创始人，最重要的工作之一就是永不失去动力，这有点令人沮丧，因为这意味着在最初的几年里，你永远无法摆脱困境。你从来没有真正休息过。我们尽量诚实地说，创业公司根本不是工作生活平衡的最佳选择，尤其是在早期。

Startups survive on their own momentum. If you have momentum, people keep delivering  results beyond what they think they're capable of. If you lose momentum, it's very difficult  to get it back.

初创企业依靠自己的动力生存。如果你有动力，人们就会不断地传递超出他们认为自己能力的结果。如果你失去动力，很难找回它。

And so continuing to make sure that the startup has a  cadence, that the startup keeps winning on a relatively short and predictable intervals, this is  really important.

因此，继续确保创业公司有节奏，确保创业公司以相对较短和可预测的间隔获胜，这是非常重要的。

And it's up to the founders, to make sure that you don't lose  a hold of this.

这取决于创始人，确保你不会失去这个。

Another thing that we think startups need, is a competitive advantage  over time. Now, this is something that sounds so obvious, I hesitated even put it  in. This is well discussed, but we're seeing more and more startups, apply to YC.  And when we asked them, "So what is the longterm monopoly effect here? What is  the long term competitive advantage? Where is the network effect in this business?" They look  at us like it's the first time they've ever heard this question.

我们认为初创企业需要的另一件事是，随着时间的推移，它们具有竞争优势。现在，这件事听起来很明显，我甚至犹豫了一下。这是很好的讨论，但我们看到越来越多的初创企业，适用于YC。当我们问他们，“长期垄断效应是什么？长期竞争优势是什么？网络在这个行业中的作用在哪里？”他们看着我们好像这是他们第一次听到这个问题。

All of the  really great businesses I know, have an answer to this question.

我所知道的所有真正伟大的企业，都有这个问题的答案。

And in fact, the  better they are, the more they pretend not to. But this is something that you  want to have a plan for.

事实上，他们越好，他们就越假装不这样做。但这是你想要的计划。

Another thing you want to have a plan for,  is at least a sensible business model. You don't have to have it all figured  out at the beginning. But when we asked founders, "So how are you ever gonna  make money?" And they look at us like it's the first time they've ever been  asked that question, which happens more often than you would think recently. That's a bad  sign too.

另一件事，你想有一个计划，至少是一个明智的商业模式。你不需要在一开始就把这一切都弄清楚。但当我们问创始人：“那你要怎么赚钱呢？”他们看着我们，好像这是他们第一次被问到这个问题，这个问题发生得比你最近想象的还要频繁。这也是个坏兆头。

Again, this one is so common that I hesitated to put it in  here. But when we ask a startup, how they're gonna grow, how they're gonna get  users, and they look at us like it's the first time they've ever heard that  question, bad sign.

再一次，这个太普通了，我不敢把它放在这里。但当我们问一家初创公司，他们将如何成长，他们将如何获得用户，他们看着我们，这是他们第一次听到这个问题，坏兆头。

So some sensible idea to try here. First, Paul Buhite, one of  the VC partners, spent a bunch of time looking at the traits of our best  founders.

所以在这里试试是个明智的主意。首先，风投合伙人之一保罗·布赫特(PaulBuhite)花了大量时间研究我们最好的创始人的特质。

And tried to distill down what they were. He came up with frugality, focus,  obsession, and love. I actually, I think that is really good, I don't have much  to add. But I think these are things, that you should be able to say  about what you're doing, and you as a founder.

试图把他们的身份找出来。他想出了节俭、专注、痴迷和爱。实际上，我觉得这很好，我没什么可补充的。但我认为这些事情，你应该能够说出你在做什么，你作为一个创办者。

And finally I want to talk  about why startups get to beat big companies. There are lots of reasons, I'm gonna  talk about a few common ones here. I think these trends are valuable enough that,  as you evaluate startup ideas, you might do. It's worth thinking about if you fit  into these. Because it's really hard for startups to beat big companies most of the  time.

最后，我想谈谈创业公司为什么要打败大公司。有很多原因，我想谈谈几个常见的原因。我认为这些趋势很有价值，当你评估创业想法时，你可能会这么做。这是值得考虑的，如果你适合这些。因为大多数时候，初创企业都很难打败大公司。

And here's some areas where we see it happening repeatedly.

这里是一些我们看到它反复发生的区域。

So I think one  difference is, if you are a product manager at a big company, and you want  to do something that sounds like a bad idea, but is a good idea, you  have to get everybody from your boss sometimes all the way up to the CEO  to say yes.

所以我认为一个不同之处是，如果你是一家大公司的产品经理，你想做一些听起来很糟糕的事情，但这是个好主意，你必须让所有人都从你的老板那里得到你的老板的支持。

So one no can kill you. If you're a startup, you can  go to YC Demo Day.

所以一个不可以杀了你。如果你是一家初创公司，你可以去YC演示日。

Any number of the thousands of investors can say yes,  and you get to have a crack at it.

成千上万的投资者中，有多少人可以说是，你就会对此有兴趣。

So it's a very different mindset.  And for those ideas that sound bad, but are good, because of this phenomenon, this  one no versus one yes, startups can win. In fact, startups usually do beat big  companies in that category of ideas.

所以这是一种完全不同的心态。对于那些听起来很糟糕但很好的想法，由于这种现象，这一种-不对-是的，初创企业可以赢。事实上，创业公司通常会在这类想法上击败大公司。

So, look for ideas that sound bad but are  good, and where you are much more likely to get one yes, than someone in  a big company is to get all yeses.

所以，寻找那些听起来不好但很好的想法，在那里你更有可能得到一个是的，而不是一个大公司的人得到所有的支持。

Another area where startups usually beat big  companies, are in very fast changing markets.

另一个领域，初创公司通常击败大公司，是在非常迅速变化的市场。

Startups, great advantages in agility and speed. The  more market is changing, the higher the number of decisions you got to make.

创业，在敏捷和速度方面有很大的优势。市场变化越大，你要做的决策就越多。

And  the higher number of tweaks to your product and your strategy you get to make.  And you want to optimize the number of those decisions that someone has to make  to compete with you, because a big company will make them, on average, worse and  certainly much slower than you do.

对你的产品和你的策略进行更多的调整。你想要优化那些与你竞争的决策的数量，因为一家大公司会使它们平均来说更糟糕，当然也会比你慢得多。

So, the speed of market evolution, gives you a  lot more chances to compound your advantage over a big company.

因此，市场演变的速度，给了你更多的机会，以复合你的优势比一家大公司。

And then finally, startups,  usually win on big platform shifts. Many people have observed that startups come in these  clusters. Those clusters usually come after a big platform shift. We'll stick with the iPhone  example here.

最后，初创企业，通常在大的平台转变中获胜。许多人观察到，初创企业是在这些集群中出现的。这些集群通常是在一个大的平台转变之后出现的。我们将继续使用iPhone的例子。

After mobile apps became a thing, many new companies got started that are  now quite valuable.

在移动应用成为一件事后，许多新公司已经起步，现在已经很有价值了。

And one of the reasons here is, most large companies work on  sort of an annual cadence at least.

其中的原因之一是，大多数大公司的工作至少每年的节奏。

And when there's a huge platform shift, they  are not good at making a big enough strategic pivot, the battleship just turns too  slowly. Whereas a startup can say, "Wow, woke up this morning, the world is fundamentally  different than it was six months ago. We're gonna go all in on this new  direction." And so, that's an area where startups usually win. There are many others, but  thinking about these three, I think, is directionally a good thing to do.

当有一个巨大的平台转变，他们不善于作出一个足够大的战略枢纽，战舰只是转向太慢。而一家初创公司可以说：“哇，今天早上醒来，世界和六个月前完全不同了。我们会朝着这个新的方向努力。”因此，这是创业公司通常获胜的领域。还有很多其他的，但我认为，从方向上来说，考虑这三者是一件好事。

Alright, that's  all I've got for today. Jeff, thank you very much for having me, and for  the class.


好吧，这就是我今天要做的。杰夫，非常感谢你邀请我来上课。
