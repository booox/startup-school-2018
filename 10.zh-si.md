# A Conversation with Andy Bromberg - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: Today is Thursday, which usually means that Adora or myself sit up here with someone notable and have a hopefully interesting conversation.

Geoff Ralston: 今天是星期四，这通常意味着阿多拉或者我和一个著名的人坐在一起，进行一场充满希望的有趣的谈话。

The someone notable we have today is Andy Bromberg, my friend and the president of CoinList, the president and co-founder of CoinList, which is this really fascinating company that is doing some interesting things we'll talk about. But Andy, maybe we can start by you talking a little bit about your entrepreneurial background, because interestingly, even though you graduated from Stanford a couple years ago, CoinList isn't your first venture, is it?

今天值得注意的是AndyBromberg，我的朋友，CoinList的总裁，CoinList的总裁兼联合创始人，CoinList是一家非常吸引人的公司，它正在做一些我们将要谈论的有趣的事情。但是安迪，也许我们可以从你的创业背景开始，因为有趣的是，即使你几年前从斯坦福大学毕业，CoinList并不是你的第一次创业，对吗？

Andy Bromberg: No, that's right. So first of all, thank you for having me, and thank you, everyone, for coming.

Andy Bromberg: 不，没错。所以首先，谢谢你们邀请我，谢谢你们，各位，感谢你们的到来。

This is going to be a lot of fun.

一定会很有趣的。

The entrepreneurial background for me started even before school in high school.

我的创业背景甚至在高中之前就开始了。

I was one of those people that started some web design and marketing businesses. Nothing really notable, but I think it was really valuable to get that initial experience of building something and hiring a team and managing a team and firing people and figuring out how to do all of

我是那些开始了一些网页设计和营销业务的人之一。没有什么特别值得注意的，但我认为真正有价值的是获得这样的初步经验：建立一个团队，雇用一个团队，管理一个团队，解雇一些人，并弄清楚如何完成所有的工作。

Geoff Ralston: Did you do all those things while you were in high school?

Geoff Ralston: 你高中的时候做过那些事吗？

Andy Bromberg: I did, yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：是的，是的。

I got started.

我开始了。

It was a lot of fun doing that.

做这件事很有趣。

Geoff Ralston: What made you do that? What was it about being an entrepreneur that attracted you while you were still in high school? God, in high school, I was worried about other things.

Geoff Ralston: 是什么让你这么做的？在你还在高中的时候，作为一名企业家吸引你的是什么？天啊，在高中的时候，我还在担心其他的事情。

Andy Bromberg: It was really nothing about being an entrepreneur and more about not wanting to do other jobs that I was able to do when I was in high school. You can sit there and you can do whatever, serve pizza or scoop ice cream or whatever it is-

AndyBromberg：这并不是说我是一名企业家，而是因为我在高中的时候不想做其他的工作。你可以坐在那里，你可以做任何事，提供比萨饼、冰激凌或任何东西-

Geoff Ralston: I worked in a supermarket.

Geoff Ralston: 我在一家超市工作。

It was awesome.

太棒了。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

I did the scooping ice cream, too. Yeah, it was fun, but I was looking at it and saying, "All these businesses in my town have awful websites, and I've got a bunch of friends that do this stuff in their spare time, and that seems like just a way better way to make a little bit of money while I'm in high school than serving pizza." So I went and did that and expanded out into videos, marketing photos, all that stuff. Ran a few websites that did pretty well. But it was really less of, "I want to be an entrepreneur," and more of, "I really don't want to do these other jobs." And it then developed into a love for building things from the ground up and trying to create, but at the time it was purely an alternative, not a primary.

我也吃了冰激凌。是的，很有趣，但我看着它说：“我们镇上所有的企业都有糟糕的网站，我有一群朋友在业余时间做这些事情，这似乎是一种在我上高中的时候赚点钱的更好的方式，而不是提供披萨。”所以我去做了，并扩展到视频，营销照片，诸如此类的东西。运行了几个做得很好的网站。但这并不是说，“我想成为一名企业家”，而更多的是，“我真的不想做其他的工作。”然后，它发展成了一种爱，从地面到地面，并试图创造，但在当时，它只是一个选择，而不是一个初级。

Geoff Ralston: So you really weren't thinking of this as like, "I'm an entrepreneur and I'm going to ..." Like, "My family has been entrepreneurs forever." It was more an escape, an alternate route from the normal high school, "I'm going to get some maybe not-so-interesting job and do something more interesting." And probably you made a lot more money doing it, too.

Geoff Ralston: 所以你真的没有想过，“我是个企业家，我要.”比如，“我的家人永远都是企业家。”这更多的是一种逃避，是普通高中的另一条路，“我要找一些也许不那么有趣的工作，做一些更有趣的事情。”也许你也赚了更多的钱。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, absolutely.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，当然。

And I think ...

我觉得.。

And not to fall into some of the immediate startup cliches, but I was doing stuff that I really enjoyed doing.

也不想被一些刚开始的陈词滥调所困扰，但我做的事情我真的很喜欢。

I was hanging out with my friends and building things, which was really fun.

我和我的朋友们在一起，建立东西，这真的很有趣。

I enjoyed that. We built a bunch of websites around just things that we'd liked, and it wasn't necessarily that we're looking at it and saying, "I'm going to analyze this opportunity and do my TAM calculation and figure out this and the business strategy." We just said, "I love playing soccer. What if I made a web site that reviewed soccer cleats?" We're like, "All right, let's do that," and we made one of those.

我很享受。我们建立了很多网站，只是围绕着我们喜欢的东西，但并不一定是说，“我要分析这个机会，做我的TAM计算，找出这个和商业策略。”我们只是说，“我喜欢踢足球，如果我建了一个网站来评论足球的夹子呢？”我们就像，“好吧，让我们去做吧”，我们做了其中之一。

It did really well. "I like messing around with computers. Let's build one around how to dig into the internals of a Mac and do things with it. Let's build that." That did pretty well.

做得很好。“我喜欢摆弄电脑。让我们围绕着如何挖掘Mac的内部并用它来做事情来构建一个。让我们来构建它。”做得很好。

And it was really based on these things that we just enjoyed doing, we had figured out how to do, and wanted to build these sites around our passions.

它真的是建立在这些我们喜欢做的事情之上的，我们已经想出了如何去做，并且想要围绕我们的激情建立这些网站。

Geoff Ralston: I'm intrigued. So this was going pretty well. You're probably a senior in high school. You get into a little school on the West Coast. Did you ever have the thought like, "I'm not going to Stanford.

Geoff Ralston: 我很感兴趣。所以这件事进行得很顺利。你可能是高中四年级的学生。你进了西海岸的一所小学校。你有没有想过，“我不去斯坦福。

I am going to just ...

我要.

I'm going to ..." Like, "I am the next," whatever, "Mark Zuckerberg.

我要.“我就是下一个”，“不管怎么样，”马克·扎克伯格。

I'm going"?

我要去“？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, I think those really, truly would have been delusions of grandeur at that point. These were little things.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：是的，我认为在那个时候，那些真的，真的是一种虚幻的幻想。这些都是小事。

They were fun and they made money and I covered my expenses and was able to do what I wanted to do, but none of these were going to be massive businesses.

他们很有趣，他们赚到了钱，我支付了我的开支，并且能够做我想做的事情，但这些都不会是大规模的生意。

And sure, of course the thought occurs. You're like, Yeah, I could just keep doing this.

当然，这种想法当然会发生。你就像，是的，我可以继续这么做。

I'm surviving on this.

我靠这个活下来了。

This would be fun. But ultimately, I got a great opportunity to go to a great school and decided to do that, and continued to do them for a little while while I was there and did some of that stuff, but trailed off during the couple years I was there and then eventually tailed off completely.

这会很有趣的。但最终，我有了一个很好的机会去上一所很棒的学校，我决定这么做，我在那里做了一小段时间，做了一些这样的事情，但是在过去的几年里，我落后了，我在那里，最后最终完全被淘汰了。

Geoff Ralston: But the idea of starting companies didn't, because apparently the bug hit you again while you were at Stanford, right?

Geoff Ralston: 但是创办公司的想法并没有，因为很明显，当你在斯坦福的时候，这个错误又一次击中了你，对吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, that's right. So I was there for a couple years, had a lot of fun. Really, actually, the most impactful bit there was tied into this whole entrepreneurship thing, which is I took this amazing class when I was there called Startup Engineering from a guy named Balaji Srinivasan, who's now the CTO of CoinBase and formerly the CEO of Earn.com and formerly a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and founder of Counsyl.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，没错。所以我在那里呆了几年，玩得很开心。实际上，最有影响力的部分是与整个创业相关的，那就是当我在那里的时候，我从一个叫Balaji Srinivasan的家伙那里学到了这个了不起的课程，他现在是Coinbase的首席技术官，以前是Earn.com的首席执行官，以前是Andreessen Horowitz的合伙人，也是Counsyl的创始人。

Amazing guy who actually lectured at the very first ever Startup School.

一个在第一所创业学校讲课的了不起的家伙。

And he taught this class about ...

他教这个班关于.。

I think a lot of times, university classes around entrepreneurship don't teach you the real skills you need to start a business.

我认为很多时候，围绕创业的大学课程不会教你创业所需要的真正技能。

They might teach you some really high level things or really basic fundamentals, but nothing around the pragmatic steps.

他们可能会教你一些非常高水平的东西或基本的基本知识，但没有任何关于务实的步骤。

And he set out to build a class much like this one that said, "No, if you're actually going to do this, what do you need to do?" There was a lot of time with guest lecturers coming into the class.

他开始构建一个类似于这个的类，它说：“不，如果你真的要这样做，你需要做什么？”有很多时间和客座讲师们一起来上课。

There was a lot of time with ...

有很多时间和.。

Things like it was a computer science class. How do you deploy code? How do you do revision control on code and how do you put it on GitHub and how do you do these different things? The practical pieces.

就像那是一门计算机科学课。如何部署代码？如何对代码进行修订控制，如何将其放在GitHub上，以及如何执行这些不同的操作？实用的作品。

And we took this class, a bunch of us, and had an amazing time, and actually out of that, which we'll come full circle back to this, a small set of folks that were in this class ended up founding the Stanford Bitcoin Group back in 2012, 2013.

我们上了这门课，我们一群人，度过了一段美妙的时光，实际上，我们将回到这个圈子里，一小群在这门课上的人最终在2012年，2013年创立了斯坦福比特币集团。

Geoff Ralston: I hope they bought some bitcoin.

Geoff Ralston: 我希望他们买了一些比特币。

Andy Bromberg: Not enough. Never enough. But yeah. So he convinced us all, "This bitcoin thing is going to be real." At the time, we're looking at him and saying, "No way, man." I mean, this is 2012. We're like, "Internet is magic Internet money.

Andy Bromberg: 还不够。永远都不够。但是的。所以他说服了我们，“比特币的事情将是真实的。”当时，我们看着他说：“不可能，伙计。”我是说，现在是2012年。我们说，“互联网是神奇的互联网金钱。

I don't believe you for a second.

我一点也不相信你。

This doesn't work." And he said, "Come on. Let's do it." And so we started the Stanford Bitcoin Group and spent a couple years in school doing a lot of awesome research and evangelism and had a lot of fun running around teaching people about crypto and building things and researching things. But then, yeah, ultimately, I did end up leaving to start a different company and left even that behind.

这不管用。“他说，”来吧。所以我们成立了斯坦福比特币集团，在学校里做了很多很棒的研究和传道活动，还在周围跑来跑去教人们一些神秘的东西和研究的东西。但是，最终，我确实离开了，创建了一家不同的公司，甚至把它抛在脑后。

Geoff Ralston: Well, so that different company was Sidewire, which interestingly seems like it's more relevant today, maybe more than bitcoin, because it was all about real news, right?

Geoff Ralston: 那么，不同的公司是Sidewire，有趣的是，这似乎比特币更有意义，因为它都是关于真正的新闻的，对吧？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So I built this platform called Sidewire.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以我建造了一个叫Sidewire的平台。

And I left school in 2014 to start this company.

我于2014年离开学校创办了这家公司。

And I left early because I found what I think is the perfect partner for it, my co-founder, Tucker, who had a background in politics and I had this background in computer science and building things, and we came together to build this project that was a platform where the experts in politics could chat publicly about the news of the day and everyone else could read and engage but not participate on that same level. We wanted to build Twitter without the news. What if you took just the experts and put them in conversation with each other? And we did this really around the 2016 election.

我很早就离开了，因为我找到了我认为是最好的合作伙伴，我的共同创始人，塔克，他有政治背景，我有计算机科学和建筑方面的背景，我们一起建立了这个项目，这是一个平台，政治专家可以在这个平台上公开谈论当天的新闻，其他所有人都可以阅读和参与，但不能在同样的层面上参与。我们想在没有新闻的情况下建立Twitter。如果你只带着专家们和他们交谈呢？我们在2016年的大选中做到了这一点。

It was 2014 to we ended up winding it down last year, 2017, but-

到了2014年，我们终于在去年，2017年结束了，但是-

Geoff Ralston: It sounds like we need it really badly.

Geoff Ralston: 听起来我们真的很需要它。

Andy Bromberg: I think we still do, and I talk to a lot of people that are building similar products trying to separate out the signal from the noise, and hopefully some of you in here or online are working to do that, too, because I think it's such a critical problem.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：我认为我们仍然是这样做的，我和很多生产类似产品的人谈过，他们试图从噪音中分离出信号，希望在座或网上的一些人也在努力做到这一点，因为我认为这是一个非常关键的问题。

Turns out, very hard problem for a variety of reasons, but I think it's critical that someone solved it.

事实证明，困难的问题有各种各样的原因，但我认为有人解决这个问题是至关重要的。

Geoff Ralston: So, maybe for the benefit of these folks, and never fear, we will talk about crypto, talk a little bit, if you would, about the process of starting the company. You left school to do it, and the winding down. What happened? And maybe if there's some lessons learned in there from that experience.

Geoff Ralston: 所以，也许是为了这些人的利益，而且永远不要害怕，我们会谈论密码，如果你愿意的话，谈谈公司的创办过程。你离开学校去做这件事，然后就结束了。发生了什么?如果有一些经验教训的话。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

Absolutely. So the starting was really ...

绝对一点儿没错所以开始是真的.。

It always is kind of the best part when you this germ of an idea and you're trying to turn it into something.

当你这个想法的萌芽，你试图把它变成某种东西时，它总是最棒的部分。

And so we started ...

所以我们开始.。

Tucker and I met and started talking. We were introduced by a mutual friend named Adam while I was still in school.

塔克和我见过面开始交谈。在我还在学校的时候，我们是由一个叫亚当的共同朋友介绍的。

And we started talking about this concept that there's this crazy noise level in the discourse today, especially around politics and other topics. Could we separate that out with a lot of different ideas around how to do it and iterate it through a million different things? And ultimately, he was working at that time a great job.

我们开始讨论这个概念，在今天的讨论中，特别是在政治和其他话题上，存在着这种疯狂的噪音水平。我们能不能用很多不同的想法把它分离出来，如何做到这一点，并在无数种不同的事情中迭代它呢？最终，他当时的工作是一份伟大的工作。

I was in school. We're looking at it, as I'm sure many people are, saying, "This is a big leap to take to go from very comfortable situations," I had a couple years left of school, he was, again, doing great at work," to make this leap." And so we said, "All right." We got to a place where nine months in of casual discussions, because we were both working and learning, we said, "We think we know what we want to do here."

我当时在学校。我们正看着它，我相信很多人都在说，“这是从非常舒适的环境中走出来的一个大飞跃，”我还剩几年的时间，他又一次在工作上做得很好，“为了实现这一飞跃。”于是我们说，“好吧。”我们来到了一个经过九个月的非正式讨论的地方，因为我们既在工作，也在学习，我们说，“我们想我们知道我们想在这里做什么。”

Geoff Ralston: And the timing was like-

Geoff Ralston: 时间就像-

Andy Bromberg: Timing was great. We're looking at this.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：时机太好了。我们在看这个。

This is right before summer 2014, so we know we've got some lead time up into the elections to build stuff and then launch into the election cycle. We thought we knew what we wanted to build.

这是在2014年夏天之前，所以我们知道我们在选举前有一些准备时间来建造材料，然后进入选举周期。我们以为我们知道我们想建什么。

And so we said, "All right. Well, we need to get some validation for this before we get going," which was just the state of mind that we were in.

所以我们说，“好吧。在我们开始之前，我们需要对此进行一些验证，”这正是我们所处的心态。

I don't think is always true for entrepreneurs by any means, but our state was, "We're both in great positions.

我不认为企业家总是这样，但我们的状态是，“我们都处于很好的地位。

This is going to be really hard. Let's get some validation." So we went out and said, "We're going to raise some money, and if we can successfully raise that money, let's go and do it." And the commitment was that if we could do that before the summer, I would go obviously over my summer and work on it full time and then beyond, and he would leave the job and go and we'd do it together.

这将是非常困难的。我们来验证一下。“于是我们走出去说，“我们要筹集一些资金，如果我们能成功地筹集到这笔钱，我们就去做吧。”我们的承诺是，如果我们能在夏天之前做到这一点，我会很明显地度过我的暑假，然后全天候地工作，然后他会离开这份工作，然后离开，然后我们一起去做。

And so we were able to put together that money and get that validation and start building.

因此，我们能够把这笔钱集中起来，得到验证，然后开始建设。

Geoff Ralston: Did you raise from angels then?

Geoff Ralston: 那你是从天使那里长大的吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, almost entirely from angels, yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，几乎完全来自天使，是的。

And we had an amazing set of investors. Lesson learned, and thankfully we didn't learn it the negative way, having great investors is such a boon throughout the business when things were going well and when things were going poorly. We'll get to the wind down. But even that part, having an amazing set of investors that were aligned with us, cared about us as people, and were supportive of what we were doing was so critical at that point, and really digging in on what their motivations were was really important. So we raised from a lot of people. We had, I forget the exact number now, but something like 44 investors in our seed round or something like that.

我们有一群了不起的投资者。值得庆幸的是，我们并没有以消极的方式来学习，当事情进行得很顺利时，当事情进展得很糟糕的时候，拥有伟大的投资者对整个企业来说都是一件好事。我们会顺风而行的。但即便是这部分，拥有一群与我们站在一起的令人惊讶的投资者，作为人关心我们，并且支持我们所做的事情，在那个时刻是如此的关键，而真正深入了解他们的动机是非常重要的。所以我们从很多人那里长大。我们有，我现在忘了确切的数字，但大约有44名投资者在我们的种子轮或类似的。

And-

还有-

Geoff Ralston: Did you ever think that maybe that was too many?

Geoff Ralston: 你有没有想过那可能是太多了？

Andy Bromberg: Yes and no.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，也不是。

The only time I ever genuinely thought that was-

我唯一次真正想到的是-

Geoff Ralston: Because you never really want to turn down money, right?

Geoff Ralston: 因为你从来不想拒绝金钱，对吗？

Andy Bromberg: Too many ... Yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：太多了.嗯

The only time I genuinely thought that was too money was when I was dealing with needing all of them to sign things. But generally, again, it goes back to the quality of the investors.

唯一次，我真正认为那是太钱，是当我处理需要他们所有签署的东西。但总的来说，这又回到了投资者的素质。

They were supportive and not annoying and never nagged us.

他们支持我们，不烦人，从不唠叨我们。

And we sent our monthly updates and made sure they were informed and it was never a problem.

我们每月都会发送最新消息，并确保他们被告知，这从来都不是问题。

It was just sending out 44 DocuSigns is a lot of DocuSigns to send out. But outside of that, it was fun.

它刚刚发出44个DocuSigns是很多DocuSigns要发送出去的。但除此之外，这很有趣。

Geoff Ralston: You can imagine one issue with 40 or 50 or 60 investors is that even if you really try to only get high quality investors, the probability that one or two of those are difficult gets pretty high.

Geoff Ralston: 你可以想象，40、50或60名投资者面临的一个问题是，即使你真的只想得到高质量的投资者，其中一两个投资者很难投资的可能性也会很高。

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：当然。

And of course, even within that set of 44, there was a spectrum of people ranging from absolutely perfect to slightly less perfect. But on the whole, it was a really great set, and we were fortunate to be supported by them.

当然，即使在44人的范围内，也有各种各样的人，从绝对完美到稍不完美。但总的来说，这是一个非常好的场景，我们很幸运能得到他们的支持。

And so we ended up doing that.

所以我们最终做到了。

And the short story on the company is we built for about a year, and then we raised the last part of that round.

公司的短故事是我们建了大约一年，然后我们提出了这一轮的最后一部分。

It was all one big round. But we raised the last part of that round from Smart Capital, who were amazing investors. Highly recommend working with them.

都是一轮大比赛。但我们从聪明资本(Smart Capital)那里筹集了最后一部分资金，他们是令人惊叹的投资者。强烈建议与他们合作。

And they completed our institutional seed round.

他们完成了我们的机构种子计划。

And then, we launched the product and ran it for a couple years and ultimately wound it down last summer, yeah, 2017, mid-2017 I think. From a product perspective-

然后，我们推出了这个产品，运行了几年，并最终在去年夏天结束了，我认为是的，2017年中期。从产品的角度看-

Geoff Ralston: Just before you get there, so you went all the way through the 2016 presidential cycle. Did you guys have any insight more than the rest of us about what was going to happen in November 2016 based on the expert discussions that were taking place?

Geoff Ralston: 就在你到达之前，你一路走过了2016年的总统竞选周期。根据正在进行的专家讨论，你们对2016年11月将要发生的事情有比我们更多的洞察力吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

There's things I can say and things I can't say, but yeah. We were talking to a lot of smart people-

有些事我可以说，有些事我不能说，但是的。我们和很多聪明人谈过-

Geoff Ralston: Say the things you can say.

Geoff Ralston: 把你能说的话说出来。

Andy Bromberg: That's a good one. Yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：这是一个很好的选择。嗯

There's a lot of-
Speaker 3: That's exactly what happened.

有很多-议长3：这就是发生的事情。

Andy Bromberg: That was exactly what happened.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：事情就是这样发生的。

There's a-
Speaker 3: Unexpected result.

有一个-扬声器3：意想不到的结果。

Andy Bromberg: There's a lot of smart people out there, and this ties into what Sidewire was able to do but also who we were talking to, we got this amazing set of experts on the platform engaging like crazy, about 1,000 people, senators, presidential candidates, reporters, analysts, staffers, all the people you would want to have talking, the really smart voices, the smart commentators, having these amazing discussions, going back and forth, firing back and forth, being entertaining.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：外面有很多聪明人，这和Sidewire能够做的事有关，也和我们交谈的人有关，我们在这个平台上找到了一群非常棒的专家，他们疯狂地参与，大约有1000人，参议员，总统候选人，记者，分析家，工作人员，所有你想要交谈的人，非常聪明的声音，聪明的评论员们，进行着这些惊人的讨论，来来回回，很有娱乐性。

And we felt like that side, because it was a marketplace, you had supply of content and demand of content, no one was paying, but supply and demand, we crushed the supply, and just, no matter what we did, we couldn't get people to pay attention to it, which we thought was so interesting. So our thesis going in, and I think a lot of times startups are about having a thesis and testing it, but a thesis we felt really strongly about, it wasn't so far as build it and they will come, but we thought, "This is a marketplace, a two sided marketplace.

我们感觉到了这一面，因为这是一个市场，你有内容的供应和内容的需求，没有人支付，但供求，我们粉碎了供应，只是，不管我们做了什么，我们都无法让人们关注它，我们认为这是非常有趣的。所以我们的论文开始了，我认为很多时候初创公司都是关于拥有一篇论文并对其进行测试，但是我们对这篇论文有强烈的感觉，它还没有建立起来，他们会来的，但是我们想，“这是一个市场，一个双向的市场。

If we can get the supply, if we can get smart people to have smart conversations about the news of the day, then we will be able to get people that show up to stick around and keep engaging with those conversations and reading them." No matter what we did, and there's no way to know what the issue was, we could not get people to come and stick around. People would show up and read one conversation and then would not come back.

如果我们能得到供应，如果我们能让聪明人对当天的新闻进行聪明的交谈，那么我们就能让出现在我们身边的人继续参与这些对话并阅读它们。“不管我们做了什么，也不可能知道问题出在哪里，我们也无法让人们前来逗留。人们会出现并阅读一次谈话，然后就不会回来了。

And I think at the end of the day what we felt like was in that space people, it's hard to get people to care about the smart conversations. People say that's what they're looking for and it might not actually be what drives them and what they actually want.

我认为，在这一天结束时，我们感觉到的是在太空中的人们，很难让人们关心那些聪明的对话。人们说，这是他们正在寻找的东西，可能并不是真正驱使他们的东西，也不是他们真正想要的东西。

Geoff Ralston: They want 140 or 280 characters of sensational tweets.

Geoff Ralston: 他们想要140或280字的耸人听闻的推文。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：是啊，是啊。

And I hope that that's not true and I hope that we had issues with the product that were deeper than that or something like that that caused it to not be effective in retaining users, but at the end of the day, we had a really tough time even given a stream of crazy high quality content from the best people in the world on these topics, tough to get those people to stick around.

我希望这不是真的，我希望我们的产品有问题，比这更深，或者类似的东西，导致它不能有效地留住用户，但是最终，我们遇到了一段非常艰难的时期，即使是来自世界上最好的人关于这些主题的疯狂的高质量的内容。很难让那些人留下来。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So this is a tough question for any startup to answer, which is, at some point you decided it wasn't an issue of tweaks.

Geoff Ralston: 好的。因此，对于任何一家初创企业来说，这都是一个很难回答的问题，那就是，在某种程度上，你认为这不是一个调整的问题。

It wasn't an issue of being able to find product-market fit. You could pivot 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 180 degrees, it wasn't going to happen.

这不是一个能够找到适合产品市场的问题。你可以旋转10度，20度，180度，这是不可能的。

And you wound the company down. How did you guys come to that decision.

你让公司破产了。你们是怎么做出这个决定的。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So we did try a couple other related but more than 10 or 20 degree tweaks but related topics, a subscription service that we tried for a little bit and pitched some enterprise-related things. Ultimately, we decided that what were looking at, the possibilities we were looking at, even if they succeeded, couldn't be venture-scale businesses that we needed to be betting on.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。因此，我们确实尝试了一些其他相关的，但超过10或20度的调整，但相关的主题，这是一个订阅服务，我们尝试了一点点，并提出了一些企业相关的东西。最终，我们决定，我们所看到的，我们正在寻找的可能性，即使它们成功了，也不可能是我们需要押注的风险规模的企业。

And these are conversation that we had with our investors, super honest, transparent conversations with them, with our team, with each other.

这是我们与投资者的对话，非常诚实、透明的对话，我们的团队，以及彼此之间的对话。

And we said, "All right. Well, the business, our core business that we've envisioned and been working on for two, three years, don't think that one is going to work, at least without some crazy change in how people are thinking or us having some insane insight of fixing something that's terribly broken.

我们说，“好吧。好吧，我们的核心业务，我们已经设想了两三年了，不要认为其中一个会奏效，至少在人们的思维方式没有发生一些疯狂的变化的情况下，或者我们有一些疯狂的洞察力，去修复一些已经严重破裂的东西。”

These other businesses we're looking at, other business lines, there's a possibility, but these aren't the type of returns that we're looking for or our investors were looking for when we started this business." And so at that point, we said, "All right.

我们正在寻找的其他业务，其他的业务线，有可能，但这些不是我们正在寻找的回报类型，或者我们的投资者在我们开始这一业务时所寻求的回报。因此，在那个时候，我们说，“好吧。”

Instead of trying to keep this thing on life support, let's wind it down and move to our next thing and keep building from there." And it was a decision that everyone was incredibly supportive of.

与其试图让这件事维持生命，不如把它放下，转到我们的下一件事，然后继续从那里继续发展。“这是一个每个人都非常支持的决定。

Again, this goes right back to the good investor thing.

再一次，这可以追溯到好投资者的问题上。

It is easy for people to give you a lot of grief when you make a decision like that, but we were incredibly fortunate to have an amazing set of investors that supported us in that.

当你做出这样的决定时，人们很容易给你很多悲伤，但我们非常幸运，有一群令人惊讶的投资者在这方面支持了我们。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. Last question on Sidewire. Do you think if you could've persuaded President Trump to call you fake news you might have been able to survive?

Geoff Ralston: 好的。最后一个问题。你认为如果你能说服特朗普总统称你为假新闻，你就能活下来吗？

Andy Bromberg: We've talked about that a lot.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：我们已经讨论了很多次了。

I don't think so.

我不这样认为

It's so bizarre, and we could talk for hours about this, but people would show up and engage, and then they'd just disappear.

这太离奇了，我们可以聊上几个小时，但是人们会出现并参与进来，然后他们就会消失。

They'd be like, "This just doesn't ...

他们会说，“这不.

It doesn't do it for me." And we talked to people and they'd say, "Yeah, oh, it's great.

我们和人们交谈时，他们会说：“是啊，哦，太棒了。”

The content is really good.

内容真的很好。

I just, I would never go and read a ton there, really pick it up." There's not a lot of people out there that pick up The New York Times every day and read it cover to cover.

我只是，我从来不会去那里读一吨，真的捡起来。“外面没有很多人每天拿起”纽约时报“来报道。

And that's effectively the same type of person that we were looking for, someone that cared about that level of discourse.

实际上，这就是我们要找的那种人，一个关心这种对话水平的人。

Geoff Ralston: You have to somehow make it a habit.

Geoff Ralston: 你必须让它成为一种习惯。

This is true for any startup. You have to somehow create enough value so that you get integrated into people's lives.

对于任何一家初创公司来说都是如此。你必须以某种方式创造足够的价值，这样你才能融入人们的生活。

And it's hard to do that with news.

新闻很难做到这一点。

Andy Bromberg: And I do think you allude to people want 140 or 280 characters or crazy stuff. Sure.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：我确实认为你暗示人们想要140或280字或疯狂的东西。好的

There's an element of that that is people want the crazy things that just spew up fake news this, fake news that, whatever it is, but the other piece of that is that it's easiest to create a habit with something that's bite-sized. And what we were asking people to do was read a real conversation.

这其中的一个因素是人们想要疯狂的东西，只想传播假新闻-这是假新闻，不管它是什么，但另一种情况是，用咬人大小的东西来养成习惯是最容易的。我们要求人们阅读一段真正的对话。

It was kind of like an iMessage format, like people were going back and forth and having these back and forth conversations.

这有点像一种iMessage格式，就像人们来回地进行这些对话一样。

That's not bite-size.

那不是咬人的尺寸。

It takes you a few minutes to read if not longer to read these really engaging ones.

读这些真正吸引人的东西需要几分钟时间，如果不是更长的话。

And they're smart people saying smart things. You got to think about what they're saying.

他们都是聪明人说些聪明的话。你得想想他们在说什么。

And jumping from not engaging with a service to engaging with a long conversation you have to read is a big jump to make.

从不参与一项服务到参与一段长时间的谈话，你必须阅读，这是一个很大的飞跃。

And so I think, yeah, to your point, building habits is so crucial, and habits are easiest started with something very small that might eventually expand to something big.

所以我认为，是的，在你看来，养成习惯是非常重要的，习惯最容易从一些很小的东西开始，最终可能扩展到大的东西。

And think about how much time many people spend on Facebook. But it often starts with something really small there to build that habit. Facebook has great things around when you sign up, it's connect with 10 friends.

想想很多人在Facebook上花了多少时间。但它通常从一些很小的东西开始，来养成这个习惯。当你注册的时候，Facebook有很多很棒的东西，它是和10个朋友联系在一起的。

They've got these numbers of you need to do this, you need to do that.

他们有很多你需要做的，你需要做的。

It's all easy.

一切都很简单。

It's all limited time.

时间有限。

And then, the habit starts getting ingrained and you can build it out bigger from there.

然后，这个习惯开始根深蒂固，你可以从那里建立起更大的习惯。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So let's transition to talk about Andy Bromberg Phase 2.5 where you went back a little bit to, I won't say your crypto roots, but back to some of the work you'd been doing earlier at Stanford and got involved with, I guess, Naval and AngelList and then eventually CoinList. How did that transpire?

Geoff Ralston: 好的。所以让我们来谈谈安迪·布罗姆伯格第2.5阶段，你回到了，我不会说你的密码根，而是回到你在斯坦福大学之前做过的一些工作，我想是海军和安杰利斯特，最后是CoinList。怎么回事？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So even to take a step further back than that, when I left school in 2014, I was crazy interested in crypto.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以，甚至比这更远的一步，当我在2014年离开学校时，我对密码非常感兴趣。

I was spending a ton of time on it with the Stanford Bitcoin Group and my friends and people in the industry. And the reason I didn't feel comfortable doing anything in crypt at that time was because of a secular issue for me, which was at that point in 2014, I couldn't make a decision.

我花了很多时间和斯坦福比特币集团以及我的朋友和业内人士在一起。而当时我不愿意在地窖里做任何事的原因是因为对我来说是一个世俗的问题，就在2014年的那个时候，我无法做出决定。

I thought it was a coin flip whether or not there was going to be one cryptocurrency forever, if bitcoin was going to be it and that was going to be the end of it, or if there were going to be a ton of cryptocurrencies out there.

我认为这是一种硬币翻转-不管是否会永远存在一种加密货币，如果比特币将成为一种货币-这将是它的终结，或者如果那里将会有大量的密码货币。

And I was looking at it and saying, "Startups, high failure rate already. Do I want to add a 50 percent coin flip to that?" Because anything I could think of betting on relied on one of those two outcomes.

我看着它，说：“创业公司，已经有很高的失败率了。我想加50%的硬币翻转吗？”因为我所能想到的任何押注都依赖于这两种结果中的一种。

And I said, "I don't want to add 50 percent more to an already attrition rate, so I'm going to not do this for now." By the time I came back end of last or middle of last year-

我说，“我不想再增加50%的减员率，所以我现在不打算这么做。”到去年年底或年中我回来的时候-

Geoff Ralston: The good news, the attrition rate is so high that 50 percent hardly makes a difference.

吉奥夫·拉斯顿：好消息是，减员率如此之高，以至于百分之五十几乎没有什么区别。

Andy Bromberg: That's another way to look at it, but yeah. Double your chance of failure is not-

安迪·布罗姆伯格：这是另一种看法，但是的。双倍的失败机会不是-

Geoff Ralston: It's hard.

Geoff Ralston: 这很难。

Andy Bromberg: A thing I want to take often. Yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：这是我想经常吃的东西。嗯

And so 2017, I'm looking at it and saying, "I'm now a believer.

2017年，我看着它说，“我现在是一个信徒。

There's going to be at least more than one, who knows how many successful cryptocurrencies in the long run." We can talk more about what that number might be and how we should think about that. But I feel comfortable going back into the space now.

至少会有一个以上的密码货币，谁知道从长远来看有多少成功的密码货币。“我们可以更多地谈论这个数字，以及我们应该如何看待这个数字。但我现在回到这个领域感到很舒服。”

And the story with CoinList is that CoinList was started about a year ago, just over a year ago. We just celebrated our internal one year anniversary.

CoinList的故事是，CoinList成立于大约一年前，也就是一年多以前。我们刚刚庆祝了我们内部的一周年。

And it was created as a collaboration between Protocol Labs, proud Y Combinator company, and AngelList to run Protocol Labs' token sale for their product Filecoin, for their token Filecoin.

它是协议实验室、自豪的Y组合公司和AngelList合作创建的，目的是为他们的产品Filecoin和令牌Filecoin运营Protocol Labs的令牌销售。

Geoff Ralston: And I think you have to unpack that a little bit, because I started to think about how ... Hopefully a lot of the people here and out there understand cryptocurrencies, and there's lots and lots and lots and lots that's been written and said about them, but maybe we can very briefly outline what a cryptocurrency is, what a token sale is, what a token is, and why you might be selling them.

Geoff Ralston: 我认为你必须把它打开一点，因为我开始考虑如何.希望在座和外的很多人都能理解加密货币，并且已经写了很多关于它们的文章，但是也许我们可以非常简单地概述一下密码货币是什么，令牌是什么，以及为什么你要出售它们。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。嗯

Three more hours, everyone?

再等三个小时，各位？

Geoff Ralston: That's a bunch, yeah.

Geoff Ralston: 那是一堆，是的。

Andy Bromberg: So I think at its core ... Yeah. Exactly.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：所以我认为它的核心是.。嗯一点儿没错

At its core, a token is a scarce digital asset, we'll talk more about what each of these things mean, a scarce digital asset that represents ownership most commonly of a token network. So the idea here is that when you launch a token network, it goes out an no one then controls it. So bitcoin, as a lot of you know, was created by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

在其核心，一个令牌是一种稀缺的数字资产，我们将更多地讨论每一件事情意味着什么，一种稀缺的数字资产，它代表一个令牌网络最常见的所有权。所以这里的想法是，当你启动一个令牌网络时，它会熄灭-没有人会控制它。所以比特币，你们很多人都知道，是由化名中本聪创造的。

I don't know if that's a a he or a she or a single person or a group of people. No one knows who Satoshi is.

我不知道那是他，她，还是一个人，还是一群人。没人知道佐治是谁。

And somehow-

不知怎么的-

Geoff Ralston: Which is weird, right? Like this really important thing that's made and lost fortunes for people and maybe will be the basis if the future economy, no one knows where it came from. Weird, right?

Geoff Ralston: 这很奇怪，对吧？就像这件非常重要的事情，它为人们创造并失去了财富，也许它将成为未来经济的基础，没有人知道它是从哪里来的。很奇怪对吧？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Like really let that settle.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。就像真的让这件事解决了一样。

It's worth like $100 billion right now, the total market cap of bitcoin, and no one knows who made it.

目前比特币的市值约为1000亿美元，没人知道是谁制造的。

And in fact, Satoshi has some large number of tokens socked away in a wallet somewhere that has never been used. We have billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. We have no idea who has that, literally no idea.

事实上，Satoshi在一个从未被使用过的钱包里储存了大量的令牌。我们有价值数十亿美元的比特币。我们不知道是谁干的，真的不知道。

Geoff Ralston: If anyone has it.

Geoff Ralston: 如果有人有。

Andy Bromberg: If anyone. Right.

Andy Bromberg: 如果有人。右（边），正确的

And so that is the ultimate ideal, how to think about it, that that's possible. You can launch this token network and have it go out into the world and have nobody control it and it just happens.

这就是终极理想，如何思考，这是可能的。你可以启动这个令牌网络，让它进入世界，没有人控制它，它就这样发生了。

And so what these companies are now doing when they launch these new tokens, like Protocol Labs launching Filecoin, their intention is to build a network. Got a lot of code to write.

因此，这些公司现在正在做的事情，当他们推出这些新的令牌，如协议实验室启动Filecoin，他们的意图是建立一个网络。有很多代码要写。

They've got to build this thing.

他们必须建造这个东西。

And they're going to put it out there into the world.

他们会把它放到世界上。

And they're, of course, going to continue to support it as core developers of the product and improve the network, but they won't actually have control over it.

当然，他们将继续支持它作为产品的核心开发人员，并改进网络，但他们实际上不会控制它。

The users, whoever those users may be and whatever categories they may fit into for that specific network, are the ones that have control over that.

用户，无论这些用户是谁，以及他们适合于特定网络的任何类别，都是对此有控制权的用户。

Geoff Ralston: We'll talk about what Protocol Labs was doing, because the token is, that Protocol Labs, it's the first token that CoinList was working on was not ... You could say bitcoin is of value in of itself.

Geoff Ralston: 我们将讨论一下协议实验室在做什么，因为这个标记是，协议实验室，它是CoinList正在做的第一个标记，不是.你可以说比特币本身是有价值的。

It's like a new currency. But the token for Protocol Labs was inextricably linked to a different value that was being delivered to consumers, right?

就像一种新货币。但是协议实验室的令牌与交付给消费者的不同价值有着千丝万缕的联系，对吧？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, yeah. We should talk about that. One other thing I want to mention just on tokens in general, and this analogy is a little bit abused, but there's one reason I'd use it.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：是啊，是啊。我们应该谈谈这个。还有一件事，我只想在记号上提到，这个比喻有点被滥用了，但有一个原因我会使用它。

I would think of tokens and blockchain technology which powers many tokens like the Internet for one really core reason.

我会想到令牌和区块链技术，它支持许多令牌，如互联网，有一个真正的核心原因。

If I asked you, "Hey, Geoff, I've got a website, and here's a bunch of data about it. How do you value it?" it's impossible to answer that question because if that website is NYTimes.com or Amazon.com or Google.com or Facebook.com, those are all totally different businesses.

如果我问你，“嘿，杰夫，我有一个网站，这是一堆关于它的数据。你是如何评价它的？”要回答这个问题是不可能的，因为如果该网站是NYTimes.com、Amazon.com、Google.com或Facebook.com，那么这些都是完全不同的业务。

They're all built on the Internet, but you look at each of their revenues, they've got different multiples. How do you think about how these businesses are built? Saying, "How do you value a website?" is kind of a meaningless question. You have to know much more about the specific use case and how it's built.

它们都是建立在互联网上的，但你看看它们的每一笔收入，它们都有不同的倍数。你认为这些企业是如何建立起来的？说，“你如何评价一个网站？”是个毫无意义的问题。您必须更多地了解具体的用例以及它是如何构建的。

And in the same way, I think there's a lot of discussion, I get the question a ton from people, "Okay. But how do we value these tokens?" And to me, that's a little bit an impossible question because tokens are built on different premises and have different applications, and you can break them down into categories and think about how to value each of those categories in the same way you could say, "Well, how do we value a social networking website?" or, "How do we value a news website?" or, "How do we value a CPG website?" But you have to think about those categories.

同样的，我认为有很多讨论，我从人们那里得到了一个很大的问题，“好吧，但是我们如何评价这些标记呢？”对我来说，这是一个不可能的问题，因为令牌建在不同的前提上，有不同的应用程序，你可以把它们分解成不同的类别，并考虑如何对每个类别进行评估，就像你可以说：“那么，我们如何评价一个社交网站呢？”或者，“我们如何评价一个新闻网站？”或者，“我们如何评价中央人民政府的网站？”但你必须考虑这些类别。

And the idea of a token or blockchain technology is really just this kind of meta concept that allows for other things to be built on top of it.

而令牌或区块链技术的想法实际上就是这种元概念，它允许在此基础上构建其他东西。

And more piece of that analogy would be I draw similarity between the Internet is infrastructure for exchanging and transacting information.

更多的类比是，我认为互联网之间的相似之处是交换和处理信息的基础设施。

It moves information around.

它到处传播信息。

Tokens and token networks are infrastructure for transacting or exchanging value. So for the first time, we can actually programmatically exchange value in this core way.

令牌和令牌网络是交易或交换价值的基础设施。因此，第一次，我们实际上可以这种核心方式以编程方式交换值。

Geoff Ralston: One of the strange things about the whole conversation ... So here's how I would answer your question about how to value a website.

Geoff Ralston: 整个谈话中的一件奇怪的事.下面是我如何回答你关于如何评价一个网站的问题。

And it actually is the way people have always valued things, which is, well, I would say, tell me about the cash flows that that website will generate over time? And then, historically, we've figured out ways to value those things using things like net present value and all these economic concepts. But tokens seem somehow different because they don't necessarily seem to be tied to cash flows.

这实际上是人们一直重视事物的方式，也就是说，我要说的是，告诉我网站会产生什么样的现金流？然后，从历史上看，我们已经找到了用净现值和所有这些经济概念来评价这些东西的方法。但令牌似乎有些不同，因为它们不一定与现金流挂钩。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So let's talk about Filecoin, like you were saying, just as an example.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。让我们来谈谈Filecoin，就像你刚才说的，举个例子。

And this is, again, just one example of many in one of many categories.

再一次，这只是众多类别中许多人中的一个例子。

I'll give you kind of a quick description of Filecoin and how it works, and we can go into it more in the Q&A. So Filecoin is a token that allows for the exchange of files, storage of files.

我将给您简要描述Filecoin以及它是如何工作的，我们可以在Q&A中更详细地介绍它，因此Filecoin是允许交换文件、存储文件的令牌。

It's aiming to solve this problem of, how do you store files and transact for that and build a market for storing files? And so if you think about the simplest solution to, "How would one build a business to solve that problem?" the simplest solution probably looks something like Amazon S3.

它的目的是解决这个问题，如何存储和处理文件，并建立一个存储文件的市场？因此，如果你想到最简单的解决方案，“一个人如何建立一个企业来解决这个问题？”最简单的解决方案可能类似于AmazonS 3。

If Geoff has files that he wants to store and I'm saying, "I'm going to start a business that helps him store these files," I'm probably going to buy a bunch of servers and Geoff is going to hand me files.

如果杰夫有他想要存储的文件，我会说，“我要开始一家帮助他存储这些文件的公司”，我可能会买一堆服务器，而杰夫会把文件交给我。

I'm going to put them on the servers. When he asks for them back, I'm going to hand them back. And he's going to pay me. So that works. Big businesses today bill like that. But it has a few problems. So one, you've got someone that's taking fees.

我要把它们放到服务器上。当他要回来的时候，我会把它们还给你。他会付钱给我的。这样就行了。今天的大企业都是这样的。但它有一些问题。所以第一，你有个人在收费。

I'm charging on top of the storage costs for him to be able to do this. But there's also issues of things like censorship. So I now have access to his files.

为了让他能做到这点，我要向他收取额外的存储费用。但也存在诸如审查制度之类的问题。所以我现在可以查阅他的档案了。

I can censor them.

我可以审查他们。

I can look at them.

我可以看看他们。

I can do whatever I want to them.

我可以对他们做任何我想做的事。

And you're relying on a single third party not to mess anything up. So I could corrupt the files.

你只依赖一个第三方就不会搞砸任何事情。这样我就可以把文件弄坏了。

I might have downtime and not be able to return them.

我可能有停机时间而不能归还它们。

And so you start to say, "Well, is there a better solution than this?" And the first version of a better solution I think looks a lot like the Airbnb of file storage where you'd say, "All right. Well, instead, there's a whole bunch of people out there who have extra storage space on their computers.

于是你开始问，“有比这更好的解决方案吗？”我认为，第一个版本的更好的解决方案看上去很像Airbnb的文件存储，你会说，“好吧。相反，有一大群人在他们的电脑上有额外的存储空间。”

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Raise your hand if you have extra storage space on your computer?

Geoff Ralston: 是的。如果你的电脑上有额外的存储空间，请举手？

Andy Bromberg: You're not totally full.

Andy Bromberg: 你还没吃饱呢。

Geoff Ralston: Seriously raise your hand. Come on, all of you. You all have extra space. No? Your computers are full? Okay.

Geoff Ralston: 真的举起你的手。来吧，你们所有人。你们都有多余的空间。否你的电脑满了？好的。

Andy Bromberg: Let's do it. We're pivoting.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：让我们开始吧。我们在旋转。

Airbnb for files. So I would say maybe, "All right. Well, now, Geoff, hand me your files.

Airbnb的档案。所以我会说，“好吧。好吧，杰夫，把你的文件给我。

I'm going to find someone out here.

我要在外面找个人。

I'm connected to all of you.

我和你们都有联系。

I've got software on your computers.

你的电脑上有软件。

I'm going to put the files on your computer, and then when Geoff wants them back, I'll ask for them back.

我要把这些文件放到你的电脑上，然后当杰夫想要回来的时候，我会把它们要回来。

I'll take them.

我来拿。

I'll give them to him. He'll pay me.

我会给他的。他会付钱给我的。

I'll pay you. [inaudible]

我会付钱给你的。[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. So these people, the few people who raised their hands, they will rent, like Airbnb, they'll rent a piece of their storage that they're not using to the network.

Geoff Ralston: 是的。所以这些人，少数举手的人，他们会租，就像Airbnb，他们会租一个他们没有用在网络上的存储空间。

Andy Bromberg: So that's a good solution, but it doesn't solve all the problems we talked about. It does, first of all, make it a little bit cheaper most likely because this is latent storage space.

AndyBromberg：这是一个很好的解决方案，但它并不能解决我们讨论过的所有问题。它确实，首先，使它更便宜一点，因为这是潜在的存储空间。

It's cheaper than buying new servers. But still, there's a middleman. There's an intermediary, me, who could go down.

这比买新服务器便宜。但还是有个中间人。有个中间人，我，可能会倒下。

I could have downtime.

我本可以休息的。

I could censor the files.

我可以检查文件。

Again, I could look at them. So you're still trusting someone. So Filecoin, Protocol Labs building Filecoin and the underlying thing called IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, which is the coolest name for a file system ever, said, "Is there a way to solve this? Can we connect Geoff directly to people out here who have extra storage space with no trusted intermediary?" That's the problem that Filecoin is trying to solve.

再一次，我可以看看他们。所以你仍然相信别人。因此，Filecoin、构建Filecoin的协议实验室以及名为IPFS的底层设备-星际文件系统-说：“有办法解决这个问题吗？我们能直接把Geoff连接到没有可信中介的额外存储空间的人那里吗？”该系统是有史以来最酷的文件系统名称。这就是Filecoin想要解决的问题。

They build this token for a few reasons. One, Filecoin is used as the mechanism of payment. So Geoff pays you to store his files with Filecoin. But there's a couple interesting problems we have to solve. First of all, what if one of you does something bad? You corrupt his files. You lose them. You don't return them fast enough. So the first step of the solution is to make each of you that is storing his files for him already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space, you already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space, you already have to have Filecoin, and you do what's called staking. You take those tokens and you put them up effectively in escrow.

他们构建这个令牌有几个原因。第一，Filecoin作为支付机制。所以杰夫付钱让你用Filecoin存储他的文件。但有几个有趣的问题我们必须解决。首先，如果你们中的一个做了坏事怎么办？你破坏了他的档案。你会失去他们。你还不够快。因此，解决方案的第一步是让每个为他存储文件的人都有Filecoin。因此，如果您有额外的存储空间，您已经有Filecoin。因此，如果您有额外的存储空间，您已经必须拥有Filecoin，并且您执行所谓的存储操作。你拿走这些代币，然后把它们有效地放在代管中。

And you say, "Here.

你说，“这里。

I'm putting my own tokens up. I'm putting something at stake.

我在放我自己的代币。我在冒险。

And if I get caught doing something wrong, if I don't return his files fast enough, if I don't return them at all, then I lose my tokens." So you are disincentivized from doing something bad to Geoff's files.

如果我被发现做错了什么事，如果我不尽快归还他的文件，如果我根本不把它们还回去，我就会丢失我的标记。“所以你不愿意对杰夫的文件做坏事。”

That's interesting step number one. You run into the second problem, which is, who's the judge of that? If we're not trusting a central intermediary, how do we know if you are not storing the files well or corrupting them, or how do we know if you're not returning them fast enough? And that's where step two of this really interesting solution comes into play, which is that there's a massive network outside of this room, thousands of people, of what they call verifiers.

这是有趣的第一步。你遇到了第二个问题，那就是，谁是这个问题的评判者？如果我们不信任一个中央中介，我们如何知道您是否没有很好地存储文件或损坏它们，或者我们如何知道您是否返回它们不够快？这就是这个真正有趣的解决方案的第二步，那就是在这个房间外面有一个巨大的网络，成千上万的人，他们称之为验证者。

And I'm going to oversimplify what they do a little bit because they have this crazy thing called proof of space time. Over the top. We could talk for hours. But a simple solution for how to make sure that each of you is storing his files correctly is that 1,000 different people come to Geoff and they each say to Geoff, "Hey, Geoff, what's the 46th letter of your file? What's the 127th letter of your file? What's the 196th letter of your file?" Then Geoff says, "It's J, A, and K." Right? And then, they go to each person that's storing the files and they ask that exact same question. That person who asked about the 47th letter says, "Hey, what's the 47th letter of the file you're storing?" You answer that, "J." And they check A, K.

我要过分简化他们所做的事情，因为他们有一种疯狂的东西，叫做时空的证明。太高了。我们可以聊上几个小时。但是，要确保你们每个人都正确地存储自己的文件，一个简单的解决方案是，1000名不同的人来到杰夫，他们每个人对杰夫说：“嘿，杰夫，你的文件的第46字母是什么？你的文件的第127字母是什么？你的档案的第196个字母是什么？”然后杰夫说，“这是J，A，和K。”对吗？然后，他们去找每个存储文件的人，问同样的问题。那个问起第47封信的人说：“嘿，你存储的文件的第47个字母是什么？”你回答，“J”他们检查A，K。

And now, all of a sudden, when enough verifiers do that, we can say with confidence that the person storing the files for Geoff is doing so correctly.

现在，突然间，当足够多的验证人员这样做时，我们可以自信地说，为Geoff存储文件的人做得很正确。

And at that point, the network says, "Great job, everyone." Geoff pays you for storing his files. You get your staked tokens back. Geoff gets his files if he wants them.

在这一点上，电视网说，“各位，干得好。”杰夫付钱给你储存他的文件。你把你的木桩代币拿回来。杰夫想要的话就能拿到他的文件。

And the verifiers get rewarded by effectively mining. New tokens are minted by the network and given to the verifiers for doing that work.

验证者通过有效的挖掘得到回报。网络创建新的令牌，并将其交给验证器来完成这项工作。

Geoff Ralston: Which makes the supply of coins expand over time.

Geoff Ralston: 这使得硬币的供应随着时间的推移而扩大。

Andy Bromberg: Exactly.

Andy Bromberg: 没错。

And so then, you have this market where each of these three parties, the person with the files, the person with the storage space, and these verifiers are all incentivized to do the right thing, disincentivized from doing the wrong thing, and there is no trusted intermediary and you avoid all those problems I cited with the S3 example at the beginning.

那么，你就有了这个市场，在这个市场里，这三方中的每一方，有文件的人，有存储空间的人，以及这些验证者都被激励去做正确的事情，不鼓励做错误的事情，而且没有可信的中介，你避免了我在一开始引用的S3例子中的所有问题。

And that really gets to the core of what this all is. And I'll stop rambling in a second here. But blockchains and tokens are about incentive alignment.

这就是这一切的核心所在。我马上就别胡说八道了。但区块链和代金券是关于激励协调的。

It's about this question of, how can you build a trustless system, a system where no party has to trust any other party in a system without anyone being involved in managing that? And the way to do that is to properly incentivize everyone and build these economic systems that allow for that interaction to happen.

关于这个问题，你怎么能建立一个不信任的系统，在这个系统中，没有人参与管理，任何一方都不能信任系统中的任何一方？这样做的方法是适当地激励每个人，建立这些经济体系，使这种互动得以发生。

Geoff Ralston: And I think that's one of the best articulations I've heard of what the blockchain-base tokens are about, incentive alignment. But they're about one more thing, isn't it? True that they're also about removing ...

Geoff Ralston: 我认为这是我听说过的最棒的设计之一-以区块链为基础的令牌，激励匹配。但他们还有一件事不是吗？没错，他们也是为了移除.。

Aligning the incentives of the folks in the network so that you can remove the central authority, so that you can remove Amazon in the S2 case or the United States government, the fed, in the bitcoin case, right?

使网络中的人们的动机一致，这样你就可以撤销中央权力机构，这样你就可以在S2案件中删除Amazon，或者美国政府，美联储，在比特币案件中，对吗？

Andy Bromberg: Right.

Andy Bromberg: 对。

And that's for any number of reasons.

这有很多原因。

And that goes back to it could be for pricing reasons.

这可能是因为定价原因。

It could be that the middleman is charging fees that are unreasonable.

可能是中间商在收取不合理的费用。

It could be for censorship reasons.

可能是出于审查的原因。

The middleman is censoring.

中间人在审查。

It could be for fear of surveillance.

可能是因为害怕监视。

It could be for any number of reasons. But ultimately, the most common and effective use of these blockchain systems is to, yes, remove that middleman and make it so that this trustless system can exist just between the counterparties the need to be involved in a transaction.

可能有很多原因。但最终，这些区块链系统的最普遍和最有效的使用是，是的，删除中间商，并使它，使这个不信任的系统可以存在于交易对手之间，需要参与一项交易。

Geoff Ralston: That's kind of the ultimately democratic version of networking, right?

Geoff Ralston: 这是一种最终民主的网络，对吗？

Andy Bromberg: It's markets for everything, yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：是的，这是一切的市场。

Geoff Ralston: So everyone out here in Startup School world might be asking themselves, "Cool, crypto. Cool, tokens. What does that have to do with me?" What does this have to do with startups? I've talked a bit about the history of investing, and we've come to this place where tokens are in fact an important component of how startups raise money and exist. Maybe you can talk a little bit about this evolution to ICOs, initial coin offerings, and the role CoinList is playing.

Geoff Ralston: 所以在创业学校世界里的每个人都会问自己：“酷，密码。酷，代币。这和我有什么关系？”这和初创公司有什么关系？我谈到了一些投资的历史，我们来到这个地方，令牌实际上是创业公司筹集资金和生存的重要组成部分。也许你可以谈谈ICO的发展，首次投币，以及CoinList所扮演的角色。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So probably a little bit of an unusual perspective here. CoinList, we run token sales. We make money when people work with us to run their token sales.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以这里可能有一点不寻常的观点。CoinList，我们负责代币销售。当人们和我们一起经营令牌的销售时，我们就能赚钱。

That's great.

太棒了。

I think today, token sales are a good idea for an incredibly, incredibly, incredibly small number of companies.

我认为，今天，令牌销售是一个好主意，对一个难以置信的，难以置信的少数公司。

I think of the 27,000, is that right, companies in Startup School, there may be a few where it's a really good idea for a token to exist, not all 27,000 today.

我想到了27，000家，对吧，创业学校里的公司，也许有一些是一个很好的主意，一个令牌的存在，而不是现在的2.7万个。

There are cases I can make for in the future it making sense for a broader set, but today, I think it's a very small number. Just to give you a date point on that. CoinList, we've existed for about a year. We've publicly worked with five token sales in the last year. We have had inbound people asking us to work with them more than 2500 token sales. And that's not a bandwidth issue.

在未来，我可以提出一些更广泛的案例，但今天，我认为这是一个很小的数字。只是想给你个日期点。CoinList，我们已经存在一年了在过去的一年里，我们公开销售了五笔令牌的商品。我们已经有入境的人要求我们与他们合作超过2500令牌销售。这不是带宽问题。

That's not us not being able to service that. That's us sitting there and saying, "These 2495 tokens, not a good fit for us." And that's kind of-

这不是我们不能为之服务的原因。那就是我们坐在那里说，“这2495个代币，不适合我们。”这有点-

Geoff Ralston: That's like one of the largest shoe-phemisms, "Not a good fit for you," meaning maybe not quite legit?

Geoff Ralston: 这就像最大的鞋类之一，“不适合你”，意思是可能不太合法？

Andy Bromberg: Maybe ... So there's a largely set we see of scams and spam and frauds and people that are bad actors or just shouldn't be involved at all.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：也许.。因此，我们在很大程度上看到了诈骗、垃圾邮件和欺诈，以及那些不称职或者根本不应该参与的人。

Geoff Ralston: How much ... Just to riff on that for one sec, how much has been raised on ICOs in 2018 thus far?

Geoff Ralston: 多少钱.为了了解一下这一点，到目前为止，ICO在2018年已经筹集了多少资金？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Estimates vary.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。估计各不相同。

It's a tough industry to study. But probably somewhere around $15 billion. It's a big number, more than venture capital.

这是一个很难学习的行业。但大概在150亿美元左右。这是一个很大的数字，不仅仅是风险投资。

Geoff Ralston: Just to repeat that in case someone maybe didn't hear that clearly, more money has been raised in ICO than has been delivered in venture capital to companies in 2018 thus far.

Geoff Ralston: 为了重复一遍，万一有人没听清楚，到目前为止，ICO筹集的资金比风险投资公司到目前为止提供的资金还要多。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

And some people look at that and say, "Wow. What a great sign for the ICO industry. We are thriving." I look at that and say, "That seems really concerning to me." Because venture capital has been around for, as we've talked about before, almost a century of real true development in venture capital, especially for technology companies.

一些人看着这个，说：“哇，这对ICO行业来说是一个多么好的标志。我们正在蓬勃发展。”我看了看，说：“这对我来说是很令人担心的。”因为风险投资已经存在了，就像我们之前所说的那样，风险投资已经有了近一个世纪的真正发展，尤其是对科技公司来说。

A pretty well developed industry. We've figured out the norms and how these things need to be created.

一个相当发达的行业。我们已经弄清楚了这些规范，以及如何创造这些东西。

The idea that ICOs have really only existed for four years and really in their mass form about two years, the idea that we could surpass that so quickly in that stage of development I see as actually a more concerning thing than a positive thing for the ICO industry.

ICO真的只存在了四年，并且以大规模的形式存在了大约两年，在这个发展阶段，我们可以如此迅速地超越它，我认为对ICO行业来说，这实际上是一件更令人担忧的事情，而不是一件积极的事情。

Geoff Ralston: One thing it shows is demand, because these are proxies for investing in startups. But it also, I guess, shows a propensity for people to believe things that maybe they shouldn't be believing.

Geoff Ralston: 有一件事显示了需求，因为这些都是投资初创企业的代理。但我猜，这也表明人们倾向于相信一些他们不应该相信的事情。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, I think that's right.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，我认为这是对的。

And it's also just a function of it being a new industry that it's brand new.

这也只是一个功能，它是一个新的行业，它是全新的。

It's really hard to diligence for these investors.

对这些投资者来说，勤奋真的很难。

There aren't norms.

没有规范。

There's no data points right now on what tokens are successful and which ones aren't we're so early into the industry.

目前还没有数据表明哪些令牌是成功的，哪些不是，我们进入这个行业太早了。

And that's ...

那是.。

It's not because everything has failed.

这并不是因为一切都失败了。

It's because it's just too early to know.

因为现在知道还为时过早。

And so investors don't have a good sense for how to do diligence.

因此，投资者对如何进行勤奋没有很好的了解。

I think about the process-

我在想这个过程-

Geoff Ralston: Even understanding what they represent, because at least if you're buying a penny stock, you still know that that penny stock represents a claim on the future cash flows of that company in one way or another.

Geoff Ralston: 即使理解了它们所代表的意义，因为至少如果你购买的是一只便士股票，你仍然知道，便士股票以某种方式代表着对该公司未来现金流的一种要求。

Admittedly, that is a theoretical thing, but at least it's grounded in something concrete.

诚然，这是一件理论上的事情，但至少它是建立在某种具体的基础上的。

A lot of times, these ICOs aren't grounded in anything.

很多时候，这些ICO没有任何根据。

Andy Bromberg: But I also ...

但是我也.。

I don't think it has to necessarily be quantitative.

我不认为它必须是定量的。

I think about the YC process for admitting companies and all the data you guys have on years of startups and what succeeds and what doesn't and what are positive signals and what aren't and how you look through those applications. You just can't do that in tokens right no.

我想到的是YC接纳公司的过程，以及你们所掌握的关于几年创业公司的所有数据，以及哪些是成功的，哪些是不成功的，哪些是积极的信号，哪些是不积极的信号，以及你如何看待这些应用程序。你不能在代币里这么做，对不对。

There's no training data to look at.

没有训练数据可看。

And so that's resulted in this we've got to be overly aggressive mentality from investors of, "Let's get in. Let's get in.

这就导致了这一点，我们必须对投资者过于积极的心态，“让我们进去，让我们进去。

These things are going to make us rich." And that's, I think, pumped up the amount of money that has gone into the space past where it really reasonably should be.

这些东西会让我们变得富有。“我认为，这就增加了进入太空的资金，这是合理的。

And it may be that that's an important step in the industry's development, that you need this kind of huge infusion of capital to give the winners enough money to start to win, and then you can sort out how to diligence it better going forward, but certainly, the vast majority of that money that has gone into ICOs is going into ICOs that are not going to be successful.

也许这是行业发展的重要一步，你需要大量的资金投入才能让胜利者有足够的钱开始赢，然后你就能找到更好的办法，让它更好地向前发展，但当然，投入ICO的绝大部分资金都流向了那些不会成功的ICO。

Geoff Ralston: So just for the edification of everyone here, could you just step back and say, what's an ICO? So what are these token things? What does CoinList ... Why would you use CoinList? Why can't you just do it? And then, maybe we can transition to answer the question, you started to talk about, who should think about doing an ICO and who shouldn't?

Geoff Ralston: 所以，为了启迪在座的每一个人，你能退一步说，什么是ICO？那么这些令牌的东西是什么呢？CoinList.。你为什么要用CoinList？你为什么就不能这么做？然后，也许我们可以转移到回答这个问题，你开始谈论，谁应该考虑做一个ICO，谁不应该？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

And just on terminology for folks that are newer to this space, I tend to use tokens, coins, cryptocurrencies all synonymously, crypto assets even. Some people have slightly different definitions.

关于这一领域较新的人的术语，我倾向于使用令牌、硬币、加密货币-所有这些都是同义词，甚至是密码资产。有些人的定义略有不同。

I tend to use them all the same.

我倾向于使用它们。

And then, ICO, token sale, kind of the same thing in my eyes. So those are generally synonymous.

然后，ICO，令牌的销售，在我眼里也是一样的。所以这些通常是同义词。

An ICO or a token sale is, ICO, initial coin offering, is when a new network is being created and a company is issuing tokens for the first time and this network is starting to distribute them.

ICO或令牌出售是，ICO，首次发行硬币，是指一个新的网络正在创建，一家公司第一次发行令牌，而这个网络正在开始分发它们。

And they run this token sale to do two things generally. One, to raise money for the future development of that network and support that network in the long term, and two, to get early distribution of those tokens, because these networks like Filecoin only works if there are people who have it to store files, people who have it to give files to be stored, and incentive alignment around that. And so you need a way to distribute these tokens initially. One way to do so is to sell them.

他们经营这个令牌的销售一般做两件事。第一，为该网络的未来发展筹集资金，并从长远角度支持该网络；第二，获得这些令牌的早期分发，因为像Filecoin这样的网络只有在有需要存储文件的人、有它提供要存储的文件的人以及围绕这些令牌的激励对齐时才能工作。所以你需要一种最初分发这些令牌的方法。这样做的一种方法是卖掉它们。

And so they go out and conduct these sales where they go and sell tokens to investors or to use users that want to eventually participate on the network or [inaudible]

所以他们出去进行这些销售，然后卖给投资者，或者使用那些最终想要加入网络或[听不见的]用户。

Geoff Ralston: Right.

Geoff Ralston: 对。

And that's a case where the network literally does not work unless you have a token.

在这种情况下，除非您有令牌，否则网络实际上无法工作。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

That's exactly right.

完全正确。

And so Filecoin was the first token sale that we supported at CoinList.

因此Filecoin是我们在CoinList支持的第一次令牌销售。

They raised a staggering $205 million in their initial coin offering.

他们在首次发行的硬币中筹集了惊人的2.05亿美元。

And we've worked on a number of other ones since, Blockstack and PROPS and Origin and TrustToken. And what CoinList does is for that small set of companies we support the logistics of the token sale. So there's a bunch of compliance work you need to do, which is probably not worth getting into, but you'll hear these buzzwords: Know your customer, KYC, anti-money laundering-

从那以后，我们做了很多其他的工作，如“星条旗”、“道具”、“起源”和“TrustToken”。CoinList所做的就是为了那些我们支持令牌销售物流的小公司。所以你需要做大量的合规工作，这可能不值得你去做，但是你会听到这样的俗语：了解你的客户，KYC，反洗钱-

Geoff Ralston: You need lawyers to be involved.

Geoff Ralston: 你需要律师参与进来。

Andy Bromberg: And we have many of them.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：我们有很多这样的人。

And so we handle the compliance. We handle the transactions, how the payments work and money comes in.

所以我们处理合规问题。我们处理交易，付款是如何工作的，钱是怎么进来的。

And we handle the-

我们处理-

Geoff Ralston: You have to know how this going to work with the SEC, because they're going to be-

Geoff Ralston: 你得知道这和证券交易委员会有什么关系，因为他们会-

Andy Bromberg: Totally. [inaudible]

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全是。[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: Already are intimately involved, right?

Geoff Ralston: 已经密切相关了，对吧？

Andy Bromberg: Lots of open regulatory questions. Lots of closed regulatory questions that you need to know how to be able to answer correctly.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：很多公开的监管问题。许多封闭的监管问题，你需要知道如何才能正确地回答。

And we support these companies through that process. And then, we'll market some of these deals publicly or offer them to the investors on our platform to be able to invest in. We also offer other services, like that just compliance piece without the marketing as much we do for a broader set of token issuers. We have this whole other Airdrops product to give tokens away to users. So you'll start hearing this buzzword Airdrops more and more I think.

我们通过这个过程支持这些公司。然后，我们将这些交易中的一些公开上市，或者提供给我们平台上的投资者，让他们能够投资。我们还提供其他服务，比如没有营销的合规部分，就像我们为更广泛的令牌发行者所做的那样。我们还有其他的空投产品可以赠送给用户。所以我想你会越来越多地听到这个流行词。

This is a way of giving ... So we talked about ICOs being a way to fundraise and to distribute tokens to users. Sometimes, you might not need to do the fundraising part and you might just want to distribute tokens to a wide set of users. How do you do that? Giveaway.

这是一种给予.。因此，我们讨论了ICO是筹集资金和向用户分发令牌的一种方式。有时，您可能不需要做筹款部分，您可能只想向广泛的用户分发令牌。你怎么做到的？送礼。

And the first example of an air drop I would argue, or one of the first, was PayPal when they got started and you'd sign up for PayPal, you'd get 10 bucks of PayPal credits.

我认为第一个空投的例子，或者说第一个例子，就是贝宝刚开始的时候，你会注册贝宝，你会得到10美元的贝宝学分。

It wasn't a token obviously. But they were saying, "We've got a network. We need people to use this network. We just need to give them a little bit of money to get started. They can send some money. You send it to a friend, pay for something.

这显然不是令牌的。但是他们说，“我们有一个网络。我们需要人们使用这个网络。我们只需要给他们一点钱就可以开始了。他们可以寄一些钱。你把它寄给朋友，付点钱。”

And then, they're going to get really addicted and start to put more money in.

然后，他们将真正上瘾，并开始投入更多的钱。

And that's what an Airdrop is.

空投就是这样。

It's a way of saying-

这是一种表达-

Geoff Ralston: And it worked.

Geoff Ralston: 而且成功了。

Andy Bromberg: It totally worked.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：它完全成功了。

Geoff Ralston: It worked.

Geoff Ralston: 成功了。

Totally worked.

完全成功了。

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. You could give tokens away to people, they can start to use them on the network, and then, hopefully, they become such a fan of that network that they put more of their own capital in to use it.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。你可以把令牌送给人们，他们可以开始在网络上使用它们，然后，希望他们成为这个网络的粉丝，他们投入更多自己的资金去使用它。

Geoff Ralston: So, who amongst Startup School world should think about tokens as a way to kickstart their network, to raise funds potentially, and who shouldn't?

Geoff Ralston: 那么，在创业学校世界中，谁应该把令牌视为启动网络、筹集资金的一种方式，谁不应该这样做呢？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So today, and this is again where I differentiate between today and tomorrow or the future, today I think the most valuable applications of this technology are applications where you have parties that are not willing to trust each other, that aren't willing to trust each other, that aren't willing to trust a central intermediary either, and you need to build this trustless system.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以今天，这也是我区分今天和明天或未来的地方，今天我认为这项技术最有价值的应用是那些你不愿意互相信任，不愿意相信一个中央中介的应用，你需要建立这个不信任的系统。

This does not describe a lot of businesses. But if you-

这并不能描述很多企业。但如果你-

Geoff Ralston: Where trust is somehow fundamental to the functioning of whatever product you're creating.

Geoff Ralston: 在这里，信任在某种程度上对你所创造的任何产品的运作都是至关重要的。

Andy Bromberg: Exactly. So if we look at an example that I would say is not a great candidate for a token, there's possibilities but not a great candidate, would be Airbnb. So on its face, you would say, "This actually sounds pretty good.

Andy Bromberg: 没错。所以，如果我们看一个例子，我会说它不是一个令牌的候选，有可能，但不是一个伟大的候选人，将是Airbnb。所以在它的表面上，你会说，“这听起来真的很不错。

I want to stay somewhere. Someone out there I've never met before has a home that I can stay in.

我想待在某个地方。一个我从未见过的人有一个我可以住的家。

I don't trust that person.

我不相信那个人。

I've never met them before.

我从没见过他们。

I've got no connection to them. But I do trust Airbnb." So you can have this intermediary.

我和他们没有任何关系。但我相信Airbnb。“这样你就能找到中间人了。

I have no problem trusting Airbnb.

我没有问题信任Airbnb。

I stay in them all the time.

我一直呆在里面。

And I say, "All right.

我说，“好吧。

If Airbnb has vetted them and they're backing me up, they've got their insurance thing, they've got all this, no problem.

如果Airbnb对他们进行了审查，他们支持我，他们有他们的保险，他们有所有这些，没有问题。

I trust Airbnb. Let's do it." That means not a great candidate for a token. But if you start to have systems where you don't trust even the intermediary much less the person on the other side, that's where a token might be a good fit.

我相信Airbnb。我们来做吧。“这意味着不是一个很好的代言人。但是如果你开始有一个系统，你甚至连中间人都不信任，更不用说另一边的人了，那就是标记可能是一个很好的合适人选的地方。

And the reason I'm not giving you-

我不给你的原因是-

Geoff Ralston: The Russian version of Airbnb maybe.

Geoff Ralston: 也许是俄文版的Airbnb。

Andy Bromberg: Right.

Andy Bromberg: 对。

Geoff Ralston: Maybe you'd want a coin for that.

Geoff Ralston: 也许你想要一枚硬币。

Andy Bromberg: Totally possible. Yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全有可能。嗯

Absolutely.

绝对一点儿没错

And trust in institutions is fading.

对机构的信任也在消退。

There's all sorts of research on this. Edelman puts out a great survey on trust every year.

对此有各种各样的研究。Edelman每年都会对信任进行一次很棒的调查。

And so there is an idea that this could be more of a thing in the future. But the reason I'm not answering your question with just a slew of examples I can give you of like if your business fits this, do a token, if your business, is because I just do not think there are that many today.

因此，有一个想法认为，这可能是一个更多的事情在未来。但是，我不能用大量的例子来回答你的问题，比如，如果你的生意适合你的话，做一个令牌的，如果你的生意，是因为我不认为今天有那么多。

And so it's more about finding these very specific use cases where it's particularly valuable to have a token than to try and fit into a category that could have a ton of tokens coming out of it.

因此，更多的是要找到这些非常具体的用例，在这些用例中，拥有令牌尤其有价值，而不是尝试将大量令牌放入其中。

Geoff Ralston: I want to save some times for questions, but just before we move on, you've talked in the past about pros and cons of tokens versus, say, convertibles of various kinds, like YC's SAFE, that probably most startups use to raise money now, both from the perspective of a startup company and from an investor. Maybe could we talk a little bit about those?

Geoff Ralston: 我想为问题留点时间，但就在我们向前看之前，你曾经谈论过令牌的正反两方面，比如YC的保险柜，它们可能是大多数初创公司现在用来筹集资金的工具，无论是从初创公司的角度还是从投资者的角度来看。也许我们能谈谈这些吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So everyone in here, especially if you're in this class, has done a lot of thinking about traditional financing and things like-

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以在座的每个人，特别是如果你是这个班的学生，都对传统的融资方式做了很多思考，比如-

Geoff Ralston: Or you will if you haven't.

Geoff Ralston: 或者如果你没有。

Andy Bromberg: Yes.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

Absolutely. Keep an eye out for those lectures.

绝对一点儿没错注意听那些讲座。

Things like investor protections. What rights do investors get? How do you have to deal with them? How do you fundraise from them? You sit down and talk to them. You follow up. You do a call.

比如投资者保护。投资者有什么权利？你要怎么对付他们？你是如何从他们那里筹集资金的？你坐下来和他们谈谈。你跟进。你打个电话。

There's all these things that go into a traditional fundraiser, things we think about. With tokens, a lot of that is flipped on its head. So probably the biggest difference is that when you buy into a token, and this goes back to our original discussion of what a token is, the company does not control the network in this ideal form.

在传统的募捐活动中，我们会考虑所有这些事情。有了令牌，很多东西就会被翻转在它的头上。因此，最大的区别可能是，当你购买一个令牌，这可以追溯到我们最初讨论的令牌是什么，公司并不以这种理想的形式控制网络。

They release this network and it goes out into the wild, and you own tokens on that network. You own part of that network. But that means you have no formal relationship to the company as an investor in these tokens.

他们会释放这个网络，然后它就会进入野外，而你在这个网络上有自己的令牌。你拥有那个网络的一部分。但这意味着，作为这些令牌的投资者，你与公司没有正式关系。

And as a company, technically, you have no formal relation to the investor that owns your tokens.

从技术上讲，作为一家公司，你与拥有你的代币的投资者没有正式的关系。

And so there's this idea right now in startups of we talked good and bad investors, like they may call you, they may check in, you've got an obligation to update them, you've got an obligation to get them to sign documents at certain times when transactions happen. When people buy into a token network released by a company, none of those obligations go.

所以我们的初创公司现在有这样的想法，我们谈论的是好的和坏的投资者，比如他们可能会打电话给你，他们可能会通知你，你有义务更新他们，你有义务让他们在交易发生的特定时间签署文件。当人们购买一家公司发布的令牌网络时，所有这些义务都不会消失。

And there are pros and cons to that certainly on both sides of the equation. On the startup side, on one hand, way easier.

这当然在等式的两边都有正反两方面的。在创业方面，一方面，要容易得多。

These people don't have any stake in your business. You can do whatever you want with the company itself.

这些人和你的生意没有任何利害关系。你可以对公司做任何你想做的事。

There's no control that they have there.

他们无法控制那里。

The downside of that is they're not necessarily aligned with you. So the upside of equity is that it's upside. When someone wins with equity, everyone wins with equity, in the general case obviously.

这样做的缺点是，它们不一定与你保持一致。所以股票的好处在于它是向上的。在一般情况下，当一个人以公平取胜时，每个人都会以公平取胜。

There's some edge cases. But incentives are aligned, and that's awesome. With tokens, the incentives, the investors are not necessarily aligned with that of the company. So if the token is pumping up for some reason and flying up the charts, an investor who invested a ton of money doesn't have any lock ups on it.

有一些边缘案件。但激励措施是一致的，这是很棒的。有了令牌，激励措施，投资者不一定是一致的公司。因此，如果由于某种原因，权证上涨了，并且上升了图表，投资了大量资金的投资者就不会有任何锁定。

They may just say, "Yeah, I'm getting out.

他们可能会说，“是的，我要出去了。

I'm up 10x right now.

我现在上升了10倍。

That seems to totally worth it.

这似乎完全值得。

I'm getting out." And they dump it and hurts the price and it hurts the company by second order effect there.

“我要出去了。”他们扔掉了它，损害了价格，也损害了公司在那里的二级订单效应。

And so you get this kind of misalignment. You win because they don't have any stake in your company but you lose because they don't have any stake in your company.

所以你就会出现这种失调。你赢是因为他们在你的公司没有任何利害关系，但你输了是因为他们在你的公司没有任何利益。

And from the investor perspective, the exact flip side of that, which is on one hand, you're not obligated to the company at all. You can do whatever you want. You just own tokens on a network they've released. But the other side of that is that you might not get as much visibility into what's happening. You might not get those monthly updates. You might not be as engaged with the founder as you may have never met the founders.

从投资者的角度来看，它的另一面是，一方面，你根本没有义务对公司负责。你想做什么都行。你只是在他们发布的网络上拥有令牌。但另一方面，你可能对正在发生的事情没有那么多的可见性。你可能得不到那些每月更新。你可能不会像你从未见过的创始人那样与创始人打交道。

The idea in startup fundraising of raising for people that you've never met before does not really happen that much. Occasionally, you see little bit with certain things, but-

为你从未见过的人筹集资金的想法并没有发生那么多。偶尔，你会看到一些特定的东西，但是-

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

Geoff Ralston: 是的。

And you'd usually advise against it.

你通常会建议不要这样做。

Andy Bromberg: Usually advise against it.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：通常建议不要这样做。

In token world, many of these sales have had hundreds or thousands of investors that just signed up on the website. CoinList facilitates this. People come and invest in sales where they have never met, talked to, chatted with the founders at all.

在令牌的世界里，许多这样的销售已经有成百上千的投资者刚刚在网站上注册。CoinList为这件事提供了便利。人们来投资销售，他们从来没有见过，交谈过，与创始人聊天。

Geoff Ralston: You can go to CoinList right now and sign up for token sales.

Geoff Ralston: 你现在可以去CoinList注册令牌销售。

Andy Bromberg: You certainly can. You can only participate if you're an accredited investor unfortunately. Site regulation sadly. But yes, you may have no relationship to the founders.

Andy Bromberg: 你当然可以。不幸的是，只有当你是一个合格的投资者时，你才能参与进来。可悲的是现场管理。但是的，你可能和创始人没有关系。

Again, pros and cons on both sides there.

再说一遍，双方都有正反两面。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

Geoff Ralston: 是的。

It's kind of an amazing from an investor perspective, because if you invest in a startup company, usually before you see any return, it's a lot of time, five, ten years. But with a token, if the token goes up tomorrow, you can invest and sell the next day.

从投资者的角度来看，这是一种令人惊讶的现象，因为如果你投资于一家初创公司，通常在你看到任何回报之前，这是相当长的时间，五到十年。但是有了令牌，如果令牌明天上升，你可以在第二天投资并卖出。

Andy Bromberg: Right.

Andy Bromberg: 对。

And I do think we are converging.

我确实认为我们在趋同。

Tokens, again, are young.

再一次，代币还很年轻。

I repeat this to myself all the time.

我总是对自己重复这件事。

They're such a young industry.

他们是个年轻的行业。

They are converging a little bit more towards venture capital. We're starting to see vesting schedules and lockups for investors trying to get this incentive alignment a little bit tighter than the freest version that I was just describing.

它们正向风险投资靠拢。我们开始看到投资者的归属时间表和锁定期，试图使这种激励关系比我刚才描述的最自由的版本更紧一些。

And I think a lot of it is going to converge that way. Early in the ICO market, companies raised once.

我认为其中的很多东西都会以这种方式汇合。在ICO市场的早期，公司只募集了一次资金。

They said, "We're going to raise one monster token sale.

他们说，“我们要举行一场怪物令牌的拍卖。

That's going to be it. We'll never need to fundraise again." More and more, we're seeing people talk about staged things that start to look a lot more like a traditional seed series A, series B.

就这样吧。我们再也不需要筹集资金了。“越来越多的人开始谈论那些看起来更像传统种子系列A，B系列的演出。

And so it's going to look more like venture capital in the future, I think, but there's still going to be these key differences of what it is that you're buying and what that means for the relationships between the people involved.

因此，我认为，未来风险投资看起来会更像风险投资，但你要购买的是什么，以及这对相关人员之间的关系意味着什么，这仍然会有一些关键的不同之处。

Geoff Ralston: Awesome. So in the time remaining, if there's any questions on any of the topics we've talked about ... Okay. Right here in the front row.
Speaker 4: Yes. So [inaudible] I have two questions, one about venture investors. You said good investors. If you could share with us three big points to look out for good investors.

Geoff Ralston: 太棒了。所以在剩下的时间里，如果有任何关于我们讨论过的话题的问题.好的。就在前排。发言者4：是的。所以(听不见)我有两个问题，一个是关于风险投资者的。你说的是好投资者。如果你能和我们分享三大点来寻找好的投资者。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. Okay. Hang on there. We'll take each one in turn. So what are the characteristics of good investors in your view?

Geoff Ralston: 好的。好的。坚持住。我们轮流拿每一个。那么，在你看来，好投资者的特点是什么呢？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So I'll talk about a couple characteristics and then a way to find out. The characteristics that I think are really important for investors is, one, alignment with whatever your goals are as an entrepreneur. Not everyone's goals in this room are going to be exactly the same. Some people might be saying, "For me, this is a $10 billion or bust.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。因此，我将谈谈几个特点，然后找出一个方法。我认为对投资者来说真正重要的特点是，一是与你作为一名企业家的目标一致。不是每个人的目标都是完全一样的。有些人可能会说，“对我来说，这是100亿美元或者破产。

That is it.

就这样。

That is all I'm going for, and I will always make the decision that leads toward that outcome." Others might say, "Listen.

这就是我所要做的，我将永远做出决定，最终导致结果。“其他人可能会说，”听着。

If I built a $10 million a year revenue business, I would be super happy, and I'm looking for investors for that." If investors are not aligned with that goal, you're going to be in big trouble, because you will eventually make a decision that runs exactly counter to what they want.

如果我建立了每年1000万美元的收入业务，我会非常高兴，我会为此寻找投资者。“如果投资者不支持这个目标，你就会有大麻烦，因为你最终会做出一个与他们想要的完全相反的决定。”

And so you need to make sure they're aligned with you on that. Second, how you interface with them.

所以你需要确保他们和你在这方面是一致的。第二，你如何与他们沟通。

Is the interaction friendly? It can be intense.

互动友好吗？可能很紧张。

They may do diligence.

他们可能会勤奋。

There may be some real back and forth and firing back and forth. But do you walk away feeling good after your interaction with them? If you do not, that is not a good sign, because you are talking to them at a time when it's supposed to be really positive. You're talking about joining forces, a one plus one equals three situation.

可能会有一些真实的来来回回的射击。但是，在与他们互动之后，你会感觉良好吗？如果你不这样做，那不是一个好的迹象，因为你是在与他们交谈的时候，它应该是真正积极的。你说的是联合，一加一等于三种情况。

If you're walking away and saying, "This does not feel totally right," that's a really bad sign, because at some point, in all likelihood, hate to break it to you, things will not go perfectly.

如果你走开说，“这感觉不完全正确，”这是一个非常坏的迹象，因为在某个时候，很可能，不愿意打破它，事情不会顺利进行。

And I'm not saying the business is going to shut down or anything, but you will have a tough time at some point.

我并不是说公司会倒闭什么的，但你总有一天会遇到困难的。

And if an investor is not great when things are good or you're talking about possible ways to work together and build something amazing, they will be really bad when things are going poorly.

如果一个投资者在事情好的时候不是很好，或者你在谈论可能的合作方式，创造一些令人惊奇的东西，那么当事情变得很糟糕的时候，他们就会变得很糟糕。

And so I'd watch out for those.

所以我会小心那些。

Those are kind of my two biggest things.

这是我最大的两件事。

The last one is, people argue about this all the time, but the idea of value add.

最后一个问题是，人们一直在争论这个问题，但是关于增值的想法。

I don't think every investor has to be crazy perfect, they're going to make some amazing difference in your business. But if they're aligned and you need capital and they believe it's a good investment, that can be fine. You don't necessarily need someone that's going to do everything. But when you can find those investors, obviously, that can make that introduction for you, give you that customer feedback, whatever it may be, recruit someone, that's tremendously valuable.

我不认为每一个投资者都必须是疯狂完美的，他们会给你的业务带来一些惊人的变化。但如果它们是一致的，你需要资金，而且他们认为这是一项不错的投资，那就没问题了。你不一定需要一个什么都会做的人。但是当你找到那些投资者的时候，很明显，它可以为你做这样的介绍，给你客户的反馈，不管是什么，招聘一个人，这是非常有价值的。

The last thing I would say on that is that I think a super underrated part of fundraising is due diligence and reference checks on investors. So few people do this, but it is amazing. You talk to an investor. You're getting towards it. You're saying, "Geoff, I think we've got a great relationship here.

对此，我要说的最后一件事是，我认为，对投资者的尽职调查和证明人调查是被低估的部分资金。这么少的人这么做，但这是令人惊奇的。你和投资者谈谈。你正在接近它。你是说，“杰夫，我觉得我们在这有很好的关系。

I'm really excited about working with you.

我真的很兴奋能和你一起工作。

I think we could do something amazing and I would love to work with you as one of my investors.

我认为我们可以做一些令人惊奇的事情，我很乐意作为我的投资者之一和你一起工作。

Is it cool? Can I talk to some people that you've invested in before? I just want to get a sense of your working style and how we could work together in the future." Now, first of all, if they say no to that, really bad signal.

很酷吗？我能和你以前投资过的人谈谈吗？我只想了解一下你的工作风格，以及我们今后如何合作。“现在，首先，如果他们对此说不，那真是个坏信号。

Anytime someone says no to a reference check, bad signal.

无论什么时候有人对证明人说不，都是坏信号。

They'll probably say yes.

他们可能会答应。

And talk to people that he sends you. Maybe talk to a couple other people that you know he's invested in that he didn't send you.

和他派你去的人谈谈。或者和其他几个你知道他投资过的人谈谈他没有派你来的。

And just ask them those questions, because every founder that's had an investor can give you a very intuitive gut check on, "Geoff is amazing. He was actually there darkest days.

问他们这些问题，因为每一位有投资者的创始人都能给你一个非常直观的直觉，“杰夫太棒了，他其实是最黑暗的日子。”

Things were tough. He came into the office, helped us figure out product strategy.

事情很艰难。他来到办公室，帮助我们制定了产品策略。

This happened.

这件事发生了。

That happened." And then, you go back to him and you say to him, "Geoff, I'm even more excited now because I talked to a bunch of these people and they said you were so helpful on this, you were so helpful on that. Let's make this happen," that's the most exciting way to close an investor conversation, highest chance of closing the money, and you've now set expectations around what you hope the relationship will be like. So I would definitely do those calls.

然后，你回到他身边，对他说，“杰夫，我现在更兴奋了，因为我和一群人交谈，他们说你在这方面很有帮助，你在这方面很有帮助。”让我们实现这一点，“这是结束投资者谈话的最令人兴奋的方式，也是结束资金的最大机会，现在你已经对你希望的这种关系产生了期望。所以我肯定会打电话给你。”

It takes time, but it's worth it for investors you're looking at working with.

这需要时间，但对于与你合作的投资者来说，这是值得的。

Geoff Ralston: So that was a solid gold answer. So please, please, please pay attention to Andy's wisdom there. Yes.
Speaker 5: I'm in the blockchain crypto space. So given the nuclear winter that's occurring right now, is CoinList looking to pivot to support STOs, or are you going to stay on the ICO half?

Geoff Ralston: 这是一个可靠的答案。所以请注意安迪的智慧。是扬声器5：我在区块密码空间。因此，考虑到现在正在发生的核冬天，CoinList是希望支持STO，还是你将继续留在ICO的一半？

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So the question is, given the nuclear winter in crypto land, is CoinList looking to pivot to STOs, or are you going to stick firmly with ICOs?

Geoff Ralston: 好的。所以问题是，考虑到核冬天在隐秘的土地上，CoinList是希望转向STO，还是你将坚定地坚持ICO？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So to unpack that a little bit, STO is a security token offering.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。因此，为了解开这个问题，STO提供了一个安全令牌。

And this goes back to what we were talking about before around the blockchain and token infrastructure being something that you can build a lot of different things on. One of those things that people talk about is what's commonly called a security token or an asset-backed token.

这可以追溯到我们之前所说的关于区块链和令牌基础设施的东西，你可以在这些基础设施上建立很多不同的东西。人们谈论的其中一件事就是通常所说的安全令牌或资产支持令牌。

And this is an idea of taking an existing asset, something that exists in the real world, the traditional world, it may be startup equity, it may be real estate, it may be gold bars, whatever it may be, and building a token that represents that asset. So one token equals one percent of this building or this building's revenue streams, whatever it is.

这是一种接受现有资产的想法，它存在于现实世界，传统世界，它可能是创业股本，它可能是房地产，它可能是金条，不管它是什么，并建立一个令牌，代表该资产。因此，一个令牌的指标等于这座建筑的百分之一，或者这座建筑的收入来源，不管它是什么。

And the question is, are we looking to support those where traditionally we supported ICOs of these tokens that are more token networks that only exist in the network itself and not in the actual, physical world.

问题是，我们是否希望支持那些传统上我们支持这些令牌的ICO，这些令牌是只存在于网络本身而不是实际的物理世界中的令牌网络。

Geoff Ralston: I mean, I guess you could do an ICO of an STO.

Geoff Ralston: 我的意思是，我想你可以做一个STO的ICO。

That's really ... It's like it's a little-

那真是.。好像有点-

Andy Bromberg: Totally. So that's right where I'd go on that, is that we are certainly looking to support offerings of security tokens. We don't see that as a pivot. We actually see ourselves as just infrastructure to support sales of tokens.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全是。所以这就是我要讲的地方，我们当然希望支持安全令牌的提供。我们不认为这是一个支点。实际上，我们认为自己只是支持令牌销售的基础设施。

Thus far, they've happened to be what are commonly called protocol tokens where they're these kind of network tokens and they function on these networks alone.

到目前为止，它们恰好是通常所说的协议令牌，它们是这种网络令牌，它们只在这些网络上工作。

If the tokens we're offering are asset-backed instead of network-backed, that makes no difference to us as the platform. We just have to figure out if it's a good fit for our investor base and if that can happen. But ultimately, the process for running those sales is exactly the same.

如果我们提供的令牌是资产支持的，而不是网络支持的，这对我们这个平台没有什么影响。我们只需要弄清楚，这是否适合我们的投资者基础，以及这是否可能发生。但最终，运营这些销售的过程是完全一样的。

Geoff Ralston: Awesome. Yeah.
Speaker 6: Are tokens currency?

Geoff Ralston: 太棒了。嗯演讲者6：代币是货币吗？

Andy Bromberg: Are tokens currency? Regulatory answer.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：代币是货币吗？监管回答。

Totally depends. Practical answer, yes and no.

完全取决于。实际答案是和不是。

In the colloquial form of currency where you're using something to exchange for something else, absolutely. Most of these tokens are some sort of object that fits into that category. Some might not be. So one example.

在通俗的货币形式中，你用某种东西来交换其他的东西，当然。这些标记中的大多数都是属于该类别的某种对象。有些可能不是。举个例子。

I often refer to Bitcoin's value as a store of value. And that means I'm really looking at bitcoin most analogous to digital gold. Gold is not a currency. You can use it to exchange for things, but it's not really great for that.

我经常把比特币的价值称为价值的储存。这意味着我真的在看比特币，它最类似于数字黄金。黄金不是一种货币。你可以用它来交换东西，但这并不是很好。

It's more used to store value. You put value into it. You take value of it.

它更多地被用来存储价值。你把价值加进去了。你看重它的价值。

And that's how I see the value of Bitcoin.

我就是这样看待比特币的价值的。

I don't think that's the same for every token. More of these tokens fall into that exchange category. But from a regulatory stance aside from the colloquial definition, the answer largely is no to that, but in certain cases maybe yes, again, depending on the exact characteristics. And we can talk about specific examples there.

我不认为每个标记都是一样的。更多的这些令牌属于交换类别。但除了口头定义之外，监管立场在很大程度上是否定的，但在某些情况下，可能是肯定的，这也取决于确切的特征。我们可以谈谈具体的例子。

Geoff Ralston: And Bitcoin is complicated, because there's Bitcoin Cash, which is maybe a currency.

Geoff Ralston: 比特币很复杂，因为有比特币现金，它可能是一种货币。

Andy Bromberg: Totally different token. So Bitcoin Cash-

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全不同的令牌。所以比特币现金-

Geoff Ralston: But it's a totally different currency, although ... Yeah. Okay. Maybe that's too much. Yes.
Speaker 7: So I have a question. So if Airbnb started today, do you think it would be a right candidate for an ICO?

Geoff Ralston: 但这是一种完全不同的货币，尽管.嗯好的。也许这太过分了。是演讲者7：所以我有一个问题。那么，如果Airbnb今天启动，你认为它会是ICO的合适人选吗？

Andy Bromberg: If Airbnb did?
Speaker 7: Yeah, if Airbnb started to-

安迪·布罗姆伯格：如果Airbnb有？主持人7：是的，如果Airbnb开始-

Geoff Ralston: So if Airbnb started today, would they be a good candidate for an ICO?

Geoff Ralston: 那么，如果Airbnb从今天开始，他们会成为ICO的好候选人吗？

Andy Bromberg: I don't think necessarily.

Andy Bromberg: 我不认为。

Again, I go back to I trust Airbnb.

再次，我回到我信任Airbnb。

I have no problem with that.

我对此没意见。

And yes, I'll go forward and rent someone's house through Airbnb and be happy with that.

是的，我会通过Airbnb租别人的房子，并对此感到满意。

There are arguments that it could be successful in that manner because maybe it's less fees if there's less of a middleman. But Airbnb does provide valuable services to me as the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for those services. I don't feel like Airbnb is taking unreasonable fees on those transactions because they provide a lot of services.

有人争论说，这样做可能会成功，因为如果中间商少一些，收费可能会更低。但Airbnb确实为我提供了有价值的服务，作为消费者，我愿意为这些服务付费。我不觉得Airbnb对这些交易收取不合理的费用，因为它们提供了大量的服务。

And so do they need a network? I don't think they need one. Could it be an interesting service? Could it be a potentially competitive service? Absolutely. But if I were starting that business today and wanted to connect homeowners or apartment owners to people that wanted to stay there, I would probably go the centralized route initially, but with an eye on the crypto space and seeing if there might be opportunities in the future.

那么他们需要一个网络吗？我觉得他们不需要。这会是一项有趣的服务吗？这会是一种潜在的竞争性服务吗？绝对一点儿没错但如果我今天开始做这件事，想把房主或公寓业主和想住在那里的人联系起来，我很可能一开始就走集中路线，但要注意隐秘的空间，看看未来是否会有机会。

The last thing I would say on that is it is underrated today how hard it is to build these token networks.

我要说的最后一件事是，今天人们低估了建立这些令牌网络的难度。

It is so hard.

太难了。

They're so young.

他们太年轻了。

The tooling is not there. Development is incredibly challenging.

工具不在那里。发展是令人难以置信的挑战。

Augur was really the first ICO that officially launched in a big way.

“预言家”是第一个以一种很大的方式正式启动的ICO。

Three years from their ICO to launching.

从他们的ICO到发射三年。

They just launched this summer.

他们今年夏天刚启动。

And the amount of work that went into that is unimaginable.

所投入的工作量是难以想象的。

Geoff Ralston: I mean, you have to replace the human beings at Airbnb who are building the processes and infrastructure to make it a trusted network.

Geoff Ralston: 我的意思是，你必须取代Airbnb的人，他们正在建设流程和基础设施，使之成为一个值得信赖的网络。

Andy Bromberg: With no precedent for how to build these things.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：如何建造这些东西是没有先例的。

And so even that alone, you're looking at it as a business trying to raise as little money as possible and push forward with what you have.

因此，即使仅此一项，你也把它看作是一项业务，试图筹集尽可能少的资金，并推动你所拥有的一切。

It's a tough move.

这是个艰难的举动。

Geoff Ralston: But do you think it's fair to say that there's a faction of crypto world that says, "Central authority bad, and we should replace all of those with a trusted network?"

Geoff Ralston: 但你认为公平地说，有一个神秘世界的派系说，“中央权威不好，我们应该用一个可信的网络来取代所有这些人吗？”

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：当然。

And I think a lot of crypto has its roots in this kind of anarcho-libertarian philosophy that I think was incredibly important for the early days of crypto because that is one of its core use cases, the avoidance of middlemen, and driving the industry forward with that philosophy is incredibly important. But that's very different from looking at it from a really pragmatic business side.

我认为很多密码都植根于这种无政府主义的自由主义哲学，我认为这对于密码的早期来说是极其重要的，因为这是密码的核心用例之一，避免中间商，并以这种哲学推动行业向前发展是极其重要的。但这与从一个非常务实的商业角度来看它有很大的不同。

And there may be some crossover there, but it's not 100 percent.

可能有一些交叉，但不是百分之百。

Geoff Ralston: Right. Over there.
Speaker 8: So maybe this is two questions. But I think said-

Geoff Ralston: 对。在那边演讲者8：也许这是两个问题。但我想我是说-

Geoff Ralston: One question at a time. Because it's really fun to pile them on, but there's a lot of people who want to ask questions. So ask the one you really want answered first.
Speaker 8: Okay. What's the difference between value and information? You mentioned the information is for information and tokens [inaudible] for value. How do you distinguish the two?

Geoff Ralston: 一次只问一个问题。因为把它们堆起来真的很有趣，但是有很多人想问题。所以先问问你真正想要回答的人。演讲者8：好的。价值和信息有什么区别？您已经提到，信息是用于信息，令牌(不可听得到)是表示值的。你是怎么区分这两种的？

Geoff Ralston: How do you distinguish between value and information?

Geoff Ralston: 你如何区分价值和信息？

Andy Bromberg: Yes.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。

It's a really important question.

这是个很重要的问题。

I think at its core, you can represent value in information. So I can make online transactions with the Internet without tokens and move value around. But what that's really doing is moving symbolic representations of value around and directing different entities to move it. So when I make a payment with my credit card on the Internet, sure, it is just information that is moving.

我认为，在它的核心，你可以代表价值的信息。因此，我可以在没有令牌的情况下使用互联网进行在线交易，并在其中移动价值。但它真正做的是将价值的符号表达围绕在周围，并指示不同的实体去移动它。所以当我在网上用信用卡付款时，当然，只是信息在移动。

I'm sending authorization codes. My CVV goes here and this happens. But ultimately what happens is it goes to one issuing, the credit card-issuing entity, and conveys them the information, "Andy just spent $10 on this merchant. Please debit $10 or put $10 on Andy's balance.

我在发送授权码。我的CVV就在这里发生了。但最终发生的事情是，它是一个发行机构，信用卡发行实体，并传达给他们的信息，“安迪刚刚花了10美元在这个商人，请借记10美元或把10美元在安迪的余额。

And then, merchant, please, here are $10. You have now been paid for your services." What didn't happen there, the Internet did not actually transmit that value.

然后，商人，请给我10美元。你现在已经为你的服务付费了。“没有发生的事情，互联网并没有真正传递这个价值。

Those entities on either side pushed the value from one to the other.

两边的这些实体将值从一个推送到另一个。

They may have done it over the bridge of the Internet, but they were the ones that were maintaining the value. What's interesting with this token ecosystem is that the value is actually totally contained in the network.

他们可能是在互联网的桥梁上这么做的，但他们才是维护价值的人。这个令牌生态系统的有趣之处在于它的价值实际上完全包含在网络中。

There are entities that are actually holding that value for you.

有些实体实际上是为你保存这个价值的。

There's no credit card issuer that is keeping an eye on my balance and taking payments from me. And there's no bank on the other side that is holding onto the merchant's money. Instead, all the value is represented on the network and people actually own that value. So I have my own keys on that network.

没有信用卡发行人在监视我的余额，并从我那里收取款项。而另一边没有银行持有商人的钱。相反，所有的价值都表示在网络上，人们实际上拥有这个价值。所以我在那个网络上有自己的钥匙。

I own those tokens or I own the representation of those tokens.

我拥有这些令牌，或者我拥有这些令牌的表示。

I'm not just owning information that gives me access to someone else owning that value. So at the end of the day, going to just a single player example, my bank account, it's my money, but it's not really my money.

我所拥有的不仅仅是能让我访问拥有这个价值的其他人的信息。最后，我只举一个玩家的例子，我的银行账户，这是我的钱，但这不是我的钱。

The bank has the money, and I just have information that allows me to access that money.

银行有钱，而我有信息可以让我获得这些钱。

In the world of tokens, I actually have ownership of that. Those are my tokens because I have the keys to access that, and no one else can do anything with it aside from me who has that access.

在令牌的世界里，我实际上拥有它的所有权。这些都是我的令牌，因为我有访问它的密钥，除了我之外，没有人能用它做任何事情。

And so when we talk about transmitting value as opposed to transmitting information, it's about direct interactions between nodes.

所以当我们谈论传递价值而不是传递信息时，它是关于节点之间的直接交互。

I can pay Geoff with tokens and never touches a third party at all, whereas with information, it requires those third parties where you're informing them to move money between each other.

我可以用代币支付Geoff，而且永远不会触及第三方，而对于信息，它需要那些第三方，在那里，您要通知他们在彼此之间转移资金。

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 9: Yeah.

Geoff Ralston: 是的。演讲者9：是的。

I [inaudible] protocol.

我[听不见]协议

It's really hard to upgrade just because it's so decentralized [inaudible] backwards-compatible things to the protocol, you are essentially creating a split in the network. [inaudible]

升级是非常困难的，因为它是如此分散(听不见)向后兼容的协议，你实际上是在网络中创建一个分裂。[听不见]

Geoff Ralston: So this is, I guess, more of a comment on the rigidity of networks. Once you put them out there, it's hard to then go and change them and upgrade them and make them backward compatible to other things. Do you agree with that?

Geoff Ralston: 我想，这是对网络僵化的更多评论。一旦你把它们放出来，就很难改变它们，升级它们，使它们与其他东西向后兼容。你同意吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yes and no.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，也不是。

I think, again, early days, so there hasn't been a lot built around the upgradability of these networks, and once you put them out there, it's harder to make those changes, especially breaking changes.

我想，再一次，早期的时候，这些网络的可升级性并没有建立多少，一旦你把它们放到那里，就很难做出那些改变，尤其是那些破坏性的改变。

There's more and more infrastructure being built that supports that.

有越来越多的基础设施正在建设，以支持这一点。

It's something that I'm not incredibly concerned about in the future.

这是我在未来不太关心的事情。

It's something that feels inevitable that we'll get to a place where these networks can be easily upgraded.

这是不可避免的事情，我们将到达一个地方，这些网络可以很容易地升级。

At the same time, it goes back to this idea, no company controls that network.

同时，它回到了这个想法，没有公司控制这个网络。

And so they can't dictatorially make that change.

所以他们不能独裁地做出这种改变。

Ifc they make a change and the users on the network don't agree with it, the network will do what's called forking, we could talk for hours about this, where you get two different ones.

IFC他们做了一个改变，网络上的用户不同意，网络会做所谓的分叉，我们可以用几个小时的时间来讨论这个问题，在那里你可以得到两个不同的。

And this is where the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash piece came in.

这就是比特币/比特币现金的来源。

If Facebook makes a change, I can't just make a new Facebook that goes back to the old change.

如果Facebook做出了改变，我就不能只做一个可以追溯到以前的变化的新Facebook。

That doesn't work.

那不管用。

I don't have access to all of Facebook's infrastructure and code.

我无法访问Facebook的所有基础设施和代码。

In the crypto world, if, say, Protocol Labs made a change to Filecoin that people didn't like, it would be totally possible for people to start back right before that change happened with the entire history of transactions with all the code and make a new version of Filecoin, Filecoin Cash-

在密码世界中，如果协议实验室对Filecoin做了人们不喜欢的更改，那么人们完全有可能在所有代码的交易历史发生之前重新开始，并制作一个新版本的Filecoin，Filecoin Cash

Geoff Ralston: And it's out of Protocol Labs' control.

Geoff Ralston: 这是协议实验室无法控制的。

Andy Bromberg: Totally out of their hands. Yeah. So it's about, again, goes back to this incentive alignment thing that, sure, maybe someone can write to this version of the protocol and make changes to it, but they have to make sure all the users are aligned from an incentive perspective to participate on that same network going forward instead of forking it off.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全不受他们的控制。嗯所以，再一次，回到激励一致的问题上，当然，也许有人可以写这个版本的协议并对其进行修改，但是他们必须确保所有的用户都从激励的角度来参与到同一个网络中去，而不是把它分叉掉。

Geoff Ralston: Or not, because you can fork, and then that fork is then backwards compatible and the new one isn't or-

Geoff Ralston: 或者不是，因为你可以用叉子，然后那个叉子是向后兼容的，而新的叉子不是或者-

Andy Bromberg: Totally.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：完全是。

Geoff Ralston: Vice versa.

Geoff Ralston: 反之亦然。

And so maybe it's easier because of the ability to fork.

所以也许这更容易，因为它有分叉的能力。

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely. Yeah.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：当然。嗯

Geoff Ralston: More questions. Over there.
Speaker 10: Going back to [inaudible] is it possible even for people with a network to propose a change [inaudible] the network [inaudible] that change?

Geoff Ralston: 更多的问题。在那边讲者10：回到[听不见的]网络中，即使是有网络的人也有可能提议改变[听不见的]网络[听不见的]这种变化吗？

Geoff Ralston: Is it possible for someone who's a node, a person who's part of the network, to propose a change that then gets incorporate into the network?

Geoff Ralston: 作为节点的人，作为网络的一部分，是否有可能提出一项改变，然后将其合并到网络中？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, absolutely. So anyone, node or otherwise, can try to fork a network and create a new version of it with a change.

Andy Bromberg: 是的，当然。因此，任何人，无论是节点还是其他节点，都可以尝试发送一个网络，并通过更改创建一个新版本的网络。

There's, again, no special control that these companies have over these networks other than some sort of moral authority.

再一次，除了某种道德权威之外，这些公司对这些网络没有特殊的控制。

If they created the network, I probably trust them to be the best stewards of that network and know how to build it.

如果他们创建了这个网络，我可能相信他们是这个网络最好的管理者，并且知道如何构建它。

They're probably the biggest experts on it because they built them in the first place. So you're going to probably go with their version until there's a reason not to.

他们可能是这方面最大的专家，因为他们一开始就建造了它们。所以你可能会选择他们的版本，直到有理由不这么做。

And as soon as there's a reason not to, which could either be because they do something bad or because someone else proposes something better, they could be going on a great path and making a great product, but if someone else, another node, anyone in this room says, "I've got an improvement to Bitcoin. I think it's going to be better than what the existing core developers are doing. I'm going to propose that.

一旦有理由不这样做，这可能是因为他们做了坏事，或者是因为其他人提出了更好的建议，他们可以走上一条伟大的道路，创造出一个伟大的产品，但如果其他人，另一个节点，在这个房间里的任何人说，“我对比特币有一个改进。我认为这将比现有的核心开发人员做的更好。我要提出这个建议。

I'm going to align people around it and get people's attention around it," that could fork and be more successful, and it's totally up to that person to do so.

我要让周围的人团结起来，让人们的注意力集中起来，“这样才能分叉，取得更大的成功，这完全取决于那个人。

Geoff Ralston: Let me argue that for a sec.

Geoff Ralston: 让我争论一下。

Andy Bromberg: Please.

Andy Bromberg: 求你了。

Geoff Ralston: Isn't true that to really ...

Geoff Ralston: 这不是真的.

These decisions become somewhat democratic, and so the network decides. But isn't it also true that these companies that do ICOs and are the creator of a token tend to hold a significant portion of the currency for themselves and therefore have the biggest voice on the network?

这些决定变得有些民主，因此网络决定。但是，这些从事ICO的公司，作为一个令牌的创建者，往往为自己持有很大一部分货币，因此在网络上拥有最大的话语权，这难道不是真的吗？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So a couple things. One is when I'm answering these kind of high level questions about crypto, I'm thinking purely of the good one, the very small set of good tokens.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。所以几件事。一种是，当我回答这些关于密码的高层次问题时，我想到的是好的，非常小的一组好标记。

There are lots of bad actors out there that build in all sorts of weird ways to influence the network, but just talking about the ideal of these tokens and blockchain networks, that's where we're going on these questions.

有很多不好的角色，他们以各种奇怪的方式影响网络，但仅仅是谈论这些令牌和区块链网络的理想，这就是我们要讨论的问题。

Absolutely some of these issuers have significant stakes in the network, but a couple things happen. One, the voices are not always based on who has the biggest stake in the network.

当然，这些发行者中的一些人在该网络中有重大的利害关系，但也会发生一些事情。首先，这些声音并不总是基于谁在网络中拥有最大的利益。

A really important voice is whoever is mining, and this is a whole nother topic, but what the consensus mechanism is. So on Bitcoin, the Bitcoin core developers is a group of people that have access and can try and change the code of Bitcoin, but it has to be adopted by all the miners, which are these people running huge server farmers doing work on the Bitcoin network.

一个真正重要的声音是谁在挖掘，这是另一个完整的话题，但共识机制是什么。所以在比特币上，比特币核心开发者是一群能够访问并试图改变比特币代码的人，但是它必须被所有的矿工所采用，他们是那些在比特币网络上运行巨大服务器的农民。

If those people choose not to adopt it, even if the ... You can think of the Bitcoin core developers as being from the entity that created Bitcoin, which isn't really true in that case because it's again created by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, but the miners have the power there, not the people that are core developing it.

如果那些人选择不收养它，即使.你可以认为比特币的核心开发者来自创造比特币的实体，在这种情况下并不是真的，因为它又是由假名中本聪创造的，但是矿工在那里拥有权力，而不是核心开发人员。

And so it depends on, again, how the network makes its decisions.

因此，这同样取决于网络是如何做出决定的。

Geoff Ralston: So it's complicated.

Geoff Ralston: 所以很复杂。

Andy Bromberg: It is complicated.

Andy Bromberg: 这很复杂。

Geoff Ralston: Okay.

Geoff Ralston: 好的。

A couple more questions. Right there.
Speaker 11: What developments would you expect to see in the ICO industry before ICOs became a viable path for more startups?

再问几个问题。就在那儿。演讲者11：在ICO成为更多创业公司的可行途径之前，你希望看到ICO行业的发展？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So what developments would I expect to see in the ICO industry before they become a viable path for more startups? It really depends on, and again, this goes back to it's a really question, what we mean by ... So when we say ICO, we're talking about initial coin offering. When we say coin or token, what are we talking about? And that's where it's so many different things. So what we've really been talking about here is a history of successful or looking to be successful protocol tokens, these tokens that are network-based that have this trust avoidance or trustless networks.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。那么，在ICO行业成为更多初创企业的可行途径之前，我希望看到哪些发展？这取决于，再说一遍，这是一个真正的问题，我们的意思是.所以，当我们说ICO时，我们指的是首次发行的硬币。当我们说硬币或令牌时，我们在说什么？这里有很多不同的东西。所以我们在这里真正谈论的是一个成功的或希望成为成功的协议令牌的历史，这些令牌是基于网络的，具有这种信任避免或不信任的网络。

I don't think there's a world where every startup is going to need to do that. I trust my corner store to give me good food.

我不认为任何一家初创公司都需要这样做。我相信我的街角商店会给我好吃的。

I trust my ... So that will always exist.

我相信我的.。所以它将永远存在。

And so I don't ever think that every company will need to a token of that blend. But you can imagine a world, going back to the STO question, where there are tokens that represent company equity, and I am purchasing company equity via a token instead of some other document, an equity round or a SAFE or whatever it may be.

所以我从来没有想过每一家公司都需要这种混合的令牌。但是你可以想象一个世界，回到STO问题上，这里有代表公司股权的记号，我是通过令牌的方式来购买公司股权，而不是其他文件，或者是一轮股权，或者是安全的，或者其他什么的。

And maybe there's an underlying SAFE below it and there's a token that represents it. For that to happen, I think what we'll need to see is just a lot more infrastructure be built out.

也许在它下面有一个潜在的保险箱，并且有一个令牌来代表它。为了实现这一目标，我认为我们需要看到的是建设更多的基础设施。

There's reasons that that is a good idea to have these asset-backed tokens, things like increased access to liquidity. There's all these exchanges being built and liquidity pools for increased liquidity for these asset-backed tokens.

拥有这些资产支持的代金券是个好主意，比如增加流动性。所有这些交易所和流动性池正在建设中，以增加这些资产支持的代币的流动性。

They're interoperable with each other so you can move them around more easily.

它们是可互操作的，所以你可以更容易地移动它们。

I think this is a trend Geoff and I have talked about before. Generally, the arc of venture capital bends towards increased liquidity and speed to liquidity, and these things come faster and faster.

我认为这是杰夫的一种趋势，我以前也说过。一般来说，风险投资的弧形转向增加流动性和流动性的速度，而这些事情来得越来越快。

A little bit of a speed bump in recent years, but generally, I think moving that way.

最近几年有点减速，但总的来说，我认为是这样的。

And tokens will only continue that trend. So I do think as infrastructure gets built out it may make sense for companies to raise equity with tokens that represent that equity.

而代币只会继续这种趋势。因此，我确实认为，随着基础设施的建设，公司可能有必要用代表这些股权的令牌来筹集股权。

And that is not some sort of crazy ICO phenomenon where you'll be able to go out as a seed stage startup and say, "My token is worth $200 million." No.

这不是一种疯狂的ICO现象，你可以作为种子阶段的初创公司，说：“我的令牌价值2亿美元。”否

It's going to represent the equity.

它将代表股权。

It'll be worth what the equity is worth, maybe with some premium for the benefits of tokenization on top of it. But we need infrastructure there, and until that infrastructure exists, I don't think it's worthwhile except as maybe a proof of concept for people to show that it's possible. But we need more built there, and hopefully that gets built in the coming months or years.

这将是值得的股票是值得的，也许有一些溢价，在此基础上令牌化的好处。但我们需要那里的基础设施，在基础设施存在之前，我不认为它是值得的，除非它可能是一个概念的证明，让人们证明它是可能的。但我们需要更多的建设，希望在未来几个月或几年内建成。

Geoff Ralston: Great. One more question right here.
Speaker 12: [inaudible] Do you think the future is going to be a handful of blockchain, or many, many hundreds, and why [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: 太好了。这里还有一个问题。演讲者12：(听不见)你认为未来会是少数几个区块链，还是很多，几百个，以及为什么[听不见]？

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Do I think the future is going to be a handful of blockchains or hundreds of blockchains? And I think it'll be a relatively small number of blockchains but a relatively high number of tokens.

Andy Bromberg: 是的。我认为未来将是一小撮区块链还是数百个区块链？我认为这将是一个相对较少的区块链，但相对较多的令牌。

And to explain that for just a minute here, many of these token networks allow for other tokens to be issued on top of them. So the most common buzzword you'll hear, Ethereum, which is the second biggest cryptocurrency out there, it's got a blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain.

为了解释一下，在这里，许多令牌网络允许在它们之上发布其他令牌。所以，你会听到最常见的流行词，Etal um，它是世界上第二大的密码货币，它有一个区块链，Etalum区块链。

And they've created standards on top of Ethereum to issue other tokens on top of Ethereum.

他们在Etalum之上创建了标准，在Etalum上发布其他令牌。

And the one you'll hear tossed around a lot is an ERC20 token.

你会听到很多关于ERC 20的标记。

This is a token that is issues on top of the Ethereum blockchain but represents something other than Ethereum and its price is not necessarily correlated with that of Ethereum.

这是一个令牌，它是Etalum区块链顶部的问题，但它代表的不是Etalum，它的价格不一定与Etalum的价格相关。

I don't think there's a need for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of blockchains to exist because they are a pain to maintain, you need all these users on it with different mechanisms for how they interact with each other, but I do think we're going to have a world with a lot of different tokens. Maybe not as many as some people think.

我不认为有必要存在数以百计的区块链，因为它们是一种痛苦的维护，你需要所有这些用户使用不同的机制来进行交互，但我认为我们会有一个有很多不同标记的世界。也许没有一些人想象的那么多。

I'm not kind of a token for everything. But if we get to this world of asset-backed tokens where all of a sudden buildings can have tokens that represent their ownership or companies can have tokens that represent their ownership, that's a lot of tokens that are possible out there, but they will not all have their own blockchains.

我不是什么东西的令牌。但如果我们进入这个资产支持令牌的世界，突然之间，建筑物可以拥有代表其所有权的令牌，公司也可以拥有代表其所有权的令牌，这是很多有可能存在的令牌，但它们并不都有自己的区块链。

They will likely be built on something like-

它们很可能是建立在这样的基础上的-

Geoff Ralston: Which would be very error prone if they do, right, because-

Geoff Ralston: 如果他们这么做的话，就会很容易出错，对吧，因为-

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：当然。

Geoff Ralston: Because it's all new code and there's all sorts of things that can break.

Geoff Ralston: 因为这都是新代码，有各种各样的东西可以破坏。

Andy Bromberg: And you need a certain critical mass for it to be safe and secure.

安迪·布罗姆伯格：你需要一定的临界质量才能让它安全可靠。

And so maybe they'll all be on Ethereum or Stellar or one of these other networks. But lots of tokens. Relatively few blockchains would be my prognostication.

所以也许它们都会出现在Etalum或者恒星或者其他网络中。但很多代币。相对较少的区块链将是我的预言。

The last point I would make on that is once again we are less than a decade into crypto at all. We are less than five years into tokens beyond the very basic building blocks at all.

我要指出的最后一点是，我们的密码还不到十年。我们还不到五年的时间，就已经超越了最基本的积木。

That is the earliest, earliest days imaginable of this ecosystem, and any prediction I make today stands probably a worse chance of being true than a good one. So who knows? We'll see in the next, in the coming decades.

这是这个生态系统最早、最早的时候，我今天所做的任何预测都可能比一个好的预测更有可能成为真实的。谁知道呢？在接下来的几十年里我们会看到的。

Geoff Ralston: And that's a great way to end.

Geoff Ralston: 这是个很好的结束方式。

Thank you very much for your time, Andy.

非常感谢你抽出时间安迪。

Andy Bromberg: Thank you.

Andy Bromberg: 谢谢。

Thank you, guys.

谢谢各位。

That was fun.


那很有趣。
