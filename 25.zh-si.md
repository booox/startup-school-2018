# The Path to $100B by Paul Buchheit

Geoff Ralston: It is now my great pleasure to introduce my longtime colleague at Y Combinator, Paul  Buchheit. Paul is known for a lot of things, not the least of which is  his wisdom in all things when it comes to startups. But he's also of course  the creator of Gmail, the inventor, this is true, of "Don't be evil" And has  had an incredible career. So I just thought I turn over to Paul for a  couple of minutes, for him to describe his journey from somewhere into YC and what's  happened then. Then we're going to have an interesting conversation, I hope, on what it  means to build an epic company. Paul.

Geoff Ralston: 现在我非常荣幸地向大家介绍我在Y Combinator的长期同事保罗·布切特(Paul Buchheit)。保罗以很多事情而闻名，尤其是他在创业方面的智慧。但他当然也是Gmail的创造者，发明家，这是真的，“不要作恶”，他有着令人难以置信的职业生涯。所以我只想把这几分钟交给保罗，让他描述一下他从某个地方到YC的旅程以及当时发生了什么。然后我们将有一个有趣的谈话，我希望，它意味着什么，建立一个史诗般的公司。保罗。

Paul Buchheit: Wow, all right, thank you. How far back do you want me to go, exactly?

Paul Buchheit: 哇，好吧，谢谢你。你到底想让我走多远？

Geoff Ralston: Where were you born?

Geoff Ralston: 你在哪里出生的？

Paul Buchheit: Where was that? Upstate New York.

Paul Buchheit: 那是哪里？纽约北部。

Geoff Ralston: Me too.

Geoff Ralston: 我也是。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I grew up in the Midwest and went to college in Ohio, in the  '90s, just different from now, probably.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我在中西部长大，90年代在俄亥俄州上大学，可能和现在不一样。

Geoff Ralston: Everything in the '90s was different from now.

Geoff Ralston: 90年代的一切都与现在不同。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, everything in the '90s was different. So, yeah, I was always interested in startups.  And even as a kid this idea, I just didn't like the idea of working  for someone else. And also I liked the idea that you could make a lot  of money and create cool new inventions basically, right? You'd read about inventors like Tesla  or someone like that, you're, "Wow, if only that guy were smarter in business." Right?  He had all-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，90年代的一切都不一样。所以，是的，我一直对创业感兴趣。甚至当我还是个孩子的时候，我也不喜欢为别人工作的想法。而且我也喜欢这样的想法：你可以赚很多钱，基本上可以创造出酷的新发明，对吗？你会读到像特斯拉这样的发明家或者诸如此类的人，你会说：“哇，要是那个家伙在商业上更聪明就好了。”对吗？他有-

Geoff Ralston: He invented so much.

Geoff Ralston: 他发明了很多东西。

Paul Buchheit: He invented so much, and he died penniless. He wasn't smart-

保罗·布奇海特：他发明了很多东西，死的时候身无分文。他不聪明-

Geoff Ralston: Didn't he start that car company?

Geoff Ralston: 他不是开了那家汽车公司吗？

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I'm not sure if he actually got any equity of that, it's too bad.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我不确定他是否真的得到了股权，这太糟糕了。

Geoff Ralston: I don't think he did.

Geoff Ralston: 我认为他没有。

Paul Buchheit: So yeah, that was always [inaudible] back in my mind. But, as I'm coming up  to graduate college, which was in 1998, so I was very interested in startups. But  there was obviously no startup school, there was no Y Combinator, there was none of  ... It was basically very little. The web was relatively tiny at the time, there  was not a lot of resources. I didn't really have any connections. I didn't know  anyone who worked at a start up, but I suspected they were in California. So  just always doing the simplest thing first-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，这一直是我脑海中的(听不见的)。但是，在我即将进入研究生学院的时候，那是在1998年，所以我对初创公司很感兴趣。但很明显没有创业学校，没有YCombinator，没有.基本上很少。当时的网络相对较小，没有太多的资源。我真的没有任何关系。我不认识在一家公司工作的人，但我怀疑他们在加利福尼亚。所以总是先做最简单的事-

Geoff Ralston: Kind of intrigued by that. What made you think of California?

Geoff Ralston: 对此很感兴趣。是什么让你想到加州的？

Paul Buchheit: I mean, eBay, Netscape, that first generation Yahoo, all of that first generation of internet  companies, those companies that are IPOed by the time I graduated, and they were all  located here, with the exception of Amazon up in Seattle. So it's pretty obvious. I  didn't have to be that-

Paul Buchheit：我的意思是，eBay，Netscape，第一代雅虎，所有的第一代互联网公司，那些在我毕业的时候都是IPO的公司，他们都在这里，除了位于西雅图的亚马逊(Amazon Up)。所以很明显。我没必要那么做-

Geoff Ralston: [crosstalk] Silicon Valley was-

Geoff Ralston: [相声]硅谷-

Paul Buchheit: I was trying to figure out where Silicon Valley is. So I took a job  out here at Intel, with the hope that I would just, there had to be  startups everywhere, I'll just find one or something.

Paul Buchheit: 我想弄清楚硅谷在哪里。所以我在英特尔找到了一份工作，希望我能，到处都有创业公司，我会找到一个或什么的。

Geoff Ralston: Right. So you went to work for the man?

Geoff Ralston: 对。所以你去为那个人工作了？

Paul Buchheit: So, yeah, I went to work at Intel, Intel is a big company, it wasn't  awesome and it wasn't terrible, it wasn't a bad job, I don't want to ...  But it wasn't something I look forward to continuing to do, year after year.

Paul Buchheit: 所以，是的，我在英特尔工作，英特尔是一家大公司，它不是很棒，也不是很糟糕，它不是一份糟糕的工作，我不想.但我不希望年复一年地继续这样做。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, we used to call working at HP where I first worked the far line  rot.

Geoff Ralston: 是啊，我们以前常说在惠普工作，我第一次工作的地方就是远线腐烂。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。

Geoff Ralston: It's comfortable, but it's a rot.

Geoff Ralston: 很舒服，但这是个烂摊子。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I actually have a specific memory, hanging out with a couple of other friends  who worked at Intel. And I'm like 21, 22 years old, something like that. And  they're talking about, "Oh, yeah, they've got this really great retirement plan where if you  work there for however many years, your age plus your number of years of service,  you could retire at 55 or something." I'm, "Ah, oh yeah, why don't I just  take the next 30 years of my life and stick it in a box and  bury it?"

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我有一个特别的记忆，和其他几个在英特尔工作的朋友在一起。我大概21，22岁，差不多。他们说，“哦，是的，他们有一个非常好的退休计划，如果你在那里工作了很多年，你的年龄加上你的服务年限，你可以在55岁或更多的时候退休。”我说，“哦，是的，为什么我不把我生命中的未来30年，放在一个盒子里，然后把它埋起来呢？”

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's worse. There are people there, when you're sitting there at 22, who have  been there for 30 years, who are just doing their time.

Geoff Ralston: 是的，情况更糟。那里有一些人，当你22岁坐在那里的时候，他们已经在那里呆了30年了，他们只是在做他们的工作。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, so I wasn't really into doing time. But I was really into Linux. So  that was my obsession. I had gotten interested in Linux, actually really early like '93,  when it wasn't actually very good and so I was an early Linux zealot who  was, "Oh, this is so awesome. This is how the future is going to be."  And back then businesses didn't really ... Linux wasn't a serious operating system, they were  like, "No, serious businesses will always use Windows, you need enterprise operating system, not some  hobbyist junk." So I was looking for something to work in Linux, everything at Intel  was pretty much Windows-based. And so that was my criteria when looking for startups. So  it's just that I wanted to be technically interested in Linux stuff. Again, there weren't  great resources on a huge list of startups. So I just scouted out what I  could find basically on Slashdot, because I would read Slashdot a lot, and I came  up with a list of like six startups, that seemed like they might be interesting,  doing stuff with Linux and so I just emailed my resume to all of them.  Ironically it immediately bounced from Google, because their mail server was mis-configured. So I didn't  hear back from most of them ever. I interviewed at one other company, and then  I resent my resume the next day and then it went through, they had fixed,  I think MX record was broken or something. So I only interviewed at Google and  one other company. And the other company, I wasn't interested, and I think maybe they  weren't interested, because neither one of us really contacted each other. And so Google was  really the only offer I had. So that made it easy to choose inside. So  I went to work there in 1999.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，所以我不太喜欢做时间。但我真的很喜欢Linux。所以这就是我的痴迷。我对Linux很感兴趣，其实很早就开始了，就像‘93年，当它实际上并不是很好的时候，所以我是一个早期的Linux狂热者，“哦，这太棒了。这就是未来的发展方向。“当时的生意并不是真的.。Linux并不是一个严肃的操作系统，他们说：“不，严肃的企业总是会使用Windows，你需要的是企业操作系统，而不是一些狂热的垃圾。”所以我在寻找在linux上工作的东西，英特尔的一切都是基于Windows的。这就是我寻找创业公司的标准。所以我只是想在技术上对Linux感兴趣。同样，在庞大的创业公司名单上也没有太多的资源。所以我就找出了我在Slashdot上可以找到的东西，因为我经常读Slashdot，我想出了一个清单，大概有六个创业公司，这看起来可能很有趣，用Linux做一些事情，所以我把我的简历发给了所有的人。具有讽刺意味的是，谷歌的邮件服务器配置错误，它立即从谷歌手中反弹过来。所以我从来没有收到他们大多数人的回音。我在另一家公司面试，第二天我对我的简历很不满，然后它就通过了，他们已经修好了，我想MX记录被打破了什么的。所以我只在谷歌和另外一家公司面试。而另一家公司，我不感兴趣，我想也许他们不感兴趣，因为我们都没有真正联系到对方。所以谷歌是我唯一的机会。这样就很容易在里面选择。所以我在1999年去了那里工作。

Geoff Ralston: And how many employees did Google have?

Geoff Ralston: 谷歌有多少员工？

Paul Buchheit: I was the 23rd at that point. And so we were in Palo Alto on  University Ave, on the second floor above what is I think, a bookshop or cafe  or something like that.

Paul Buchheit: 我当时是第23位。所以我们在大学大道上的帕洛阿尔托，在我想的第二层，书店或咖啡馆之类的地方。

Geoff Ralston: What did it feel like at Google when there were 20 employees there?

Geoff Ralston: 当谷歌有20名员工时，感觉如何？

Paul Buchheit: It was really cool. Actually, I was really impressed when I was interviewing with them  that they asked actually, really smart questions, which I think is a pretty good indication.  That was one of the other reasons I wasn't excited, the other startup I went  to, that I'd interview at, it was just like I went into their office and  I just sort of felt depressed. You could just tell people weren't really that excited  to be there, and then they'd ask dumb questions that I didn't think were ...  Anyway, it just wasn't a good sign versus Google, they were into whatever it was  they were doing. And actually, after I was there for, maybe a week, I went  back and I'm, "Hey, I want more equity." They were like, "Sorry, you have to  negotiate that before you start." So, yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 真的很酷。事实上，当我采访他们的时候，我印象深刻，他们问了非常聪明的问题，我认为这是一个很好的暗示。这是我不兴奋的另一个原因，我去的另一个创业公司，我会去面试，就像我走进他们的办公室，我只是有点沮丧。你可以告诉大家，在场的人并不是那么兴奋，然后他们会问一些我不认为是…的愚蠢的问题.不管怎么说，这对谷歌来说并不是个好兆头，不管他们在做什么，他们都对此感兴趣。实际上，在我在那里待了一周之后，我回到了那里，我说，“嘿，我想要更多的股权。”他们说，“对不起，你必须在开始之前谈判。”所以，是的。

Geoff Ralston: That might have been the smartest pseudo investment decision you've ever made, even though it  didn't, I guess it worked out but-

Geoff Ralston: 这可能是你所做过的最聪明的假投资决定，尽管没有，我想是成功了，但是-

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, it worked out overall. But yeah, I do wish I'd gotten more.  So the thing about their office I mean, you asked about the environment, it just  had a buzz of productivity, right? Because we were doing these really exciting things, and  I think they had hired people who are really into building these big systems, and  creating great products and everything. So it was an exciting place to work where I  would actually wake up in the morning and be eager to go to work because  I've got stuff I want to do.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我的意思是，它的整体效果。但我确实希望我能得到更多。所以关于他们办公室的事情-我的意思是，你问的是环境问题，它只是有一种生产力的嗡嗡声，对吧？因为我们在做这些非常令人兴奋的事情，我认为他们雇佣了那些真正致力于构建这些大系统的人，并且创造了伟大的产品和一切。因此，这是一个令人兴奋的工作场所，在那里我会在早上醒来，并渴望去工作，因为我有我想做的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Do you think that was because, not just they were working on exciting things, but  because they believed they were going somewhere?

Geoff Ralston: 你认为那是因为，不仅仅是因为他们在做令人兴奋的事情，而是因为他们相信自己要去某个地方？

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, there is an irrational belief, right? Objectively, we were just this tiny  little company or wherever. But Larry would be talking about whatever crazy ideas, we were  just, "Wow." I remember having an early memory where I was building this system, and  then I'm talking to Larry about, he's, "Why are you even bothering with the disk?  We're just going to store everything in memory, or whatever." Which at the time was  absurd, we didn't have enough RAM to store all the data, but he was always  thinking so many years ahead. And it was a little bit insane, but it made  it a very exciting place to be.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我是说，有一种非理性的信念，对吗？客观上说，我们只是一个小小的公司。但拉里会谈论任何疯狂的想法，我们只是，“哇”。我记得我有一个早期的记忆，当时我在构建这个系统，然后我跟拉里说，“你为什么还要麻烦磁盘呢？我们只是把所有的东西都存储在内存里，或者什么的。”这在当时是荒谬的，我们没有足够的RAM来存储所有的数据，但是他一直在想很多年前的事情。这是有点疯狂，但它使它成为一个非常令人兴奋的地方。

Geoff Ralston: It seems like there's something fundamental, if you're thinking about whether you have the potential  to build a really big business, if you don't have some vision, some idea of  a future, it's hard to believe you're ever going to get there.

Geoff Ralston: 似乎有一些基本的东西，如果你在考虑你是否有潜力建立一家真正的大企业，如果你没有什么远见，对未来的一些想法，很难相信你能做到。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think you have to have some notion of the big picture. And it  doesn't mean you look like a detailed step by step plan, occasionally I'll run into  a startup where they're, "Here's our five step plan, for how we become whatever." And  it isn't until the fifth step, that actually they have a product, anyone would want  to use. I mean, you have to have something today that's good. And you have  to have something tomorrow, day after day have a product that people actually want.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我认为你必须对大局有所了解。这并不意味着你看起来像一个详细的一步的计划，偶尔我会遇到一家创业公司，他们会说：“这是我们的五步计划，我们是如何成为任何东西的。”直到第五步，他们才有了产品，任何人都会想要使用。我是说，你今天得吃点好吃的东西。明天你必须拥有一些东西，日复一日地拥有人们真正想要的产品。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, you almost want a certain amount of vagueness around your vision, because if you  have too much detail, you're just guaranteed to have wasted your time, because it's not  going to be right. So you spent how much time at Google?

Geoff Ralston: 是啊，你几乎想要某种程度的模糊，因为如果你有太多的细节，你肯定会浪费你的时间，因为这样做是不对的。你在谷歌花了多少时间？

Paul Buchheit: So I was at Google for seven years.

Paul Buchheit: 所以我在谷歌工作了七年。

Geoff Ralston: Well, that's just about how long you've been at YC now.

Geoff Ralston: 嗯，这就是你在YC待了多久了。

Paul Buchheit: I've actually been at YC for over seven years now.

Paul Buchheit: 我已经在YC工作了七年多了。

Geoff Ralston: So what happened during those seven years? Stuff happened, right?

Geoff Ralston: 那这七年发生了什么？事情发生了，对吧？

Paul Buchheit: Stuff happened, a few things.

Paul Buchheit: 事情发生了，有些事情发生了。

Geoff Ralston: And when did you know? When did you realize that Google was a thing? That  it was going to be this secular juggernaut that was going to take over the  world?

Geoff Ralston: 你什么时候知道的？你什么时候意识到Google是一回事？它将是一个世俗的巨人，将接管世界？

Paul Buchheit: Earlier this year. I mean, it builds. I think like many people, I continually underestimated  its potential. But from very early on, after being there for a week, I was,  "Ooh, there's something magical going on." I didn't think it would be what it is  today, as as big as it is, but it definitely felt like we were somehow  creating the future. And then when we started really, like when we got the Yahoo  deal and started really displacing-

Paul Buchheit: 今年早些时候。我是说，它会建造。我想和很多人一样，我一直低估了它的潜力。但是从很早的时候，在那里呆了一周后，我就说：“哦，发生了一件神奇的事情。”我不认为它会是今天的样子，因为它是巨大的，但它绝对感觉我们是在创造未来。当我们真正开始的时候，比如当我们得到雅虎的交易，并且开始真正的取代-

Geoff Ralston: You're welcome.

Geoff Ralston: 不客气。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. We started really just crushing all the other search engines. And then there was  like a feeling of inevitability, it was pretty clear, we were just going to win  because no one else like they just didn't even know what they were doing. Competition  just wasn't very good.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。我们刚刚开始粉碎所有其他搜索引擎。然后是一种不可避免的感觉，很明显，我们会赢，因为没有其他人像他们一样不知道自己在做什么。竞争不是很好。

Geoff Ralston: Before we move on to leaving Google and starting your own company, just maybe say  a word about the founding of Gmail and how that happened.

Geoff Ralston: 在我们离开谷歌并创办你自己的公司之前，或许可以谈谈Gmail的创建以及这是如何发生的。

Paul Buchheit: Sure. So email was actually a thing that I've been interested in for a long  time, I actually-

Paul Buchheit: 当然。所以电子邮件其实是我很久以来一直感兴趣的东西，实际上-

Geoff Ralston: Ever since your resume bounced?

Geoff Ralston: 自从你的简历被反弹以来？

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. No actually before that. So in college, I had actually been thinking a lot  about this, because like, again, back in the '90s, people, their email would download to  their computer, they would run like Eudora, or something, and they would use pop three  to pull the email down to their computer. And I remember people would be, "I  need to go to my room to check my email." I'm, "That's dumb, that doesn't  make any sense. It's information, it shouldn't be stuck in a box." Right? And so  I'd been thinking about this idea that everything is just going to be online. And  then we'll just be able to access it anywhere, anytime we want. And so I  actually in the summer of 1996, I think, I had gotten maybe a little bit  excessively arrogant and had only applied for a couple of summer jobs, just assuming they  would want to hire me, and they didn't. So I ended up with a job.  And so I'm, "That's fine. I'm just going to start my own company." And so  I actually tried to start this thing of a web-based email. But I-

Paul Buchheit: 是的。不，实际上在那之前。所以在大学的时候，我一直在想这件事，因为，在90年代，人们，他们的电子邮件会下载到他们的电脑上，他们会像尤多拉一样运行，或者什么的，他们会用POP 3把电子邮件拉到他们的电脑上。我记得人们会说，“我需要回我的房间查看我的电子邮件。”我说，“这太蠢了，没道理。这是信息，不应该卡在盒子里。“对吗？所以我一直在想这样一个想法，那就是所有的东西都要上网了。然后我们就可以随时随地访问它。所以我实际上在1996年夏天，我想，我可能有点自大，我只申请了几份暑期工作，只是假设他们想雇用我，但他们没有。所以我最终得到了一份工作。所以我说，“没关系。我只想开一家自己的公司。“所以我试着开始写一封基于网络的电子邮件。但我-

Geoff Ralston: That's funny, because that's right when we were building web-based email.

Geoff Ralston: 这很有趣，因为我们当时正在构建基于网络的电子邮件。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, mine would have been better.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我的会更好。

Geoff Ralston: '95, '96. Rocket mail was really good.

Geoff Ralston: ‘95年，’96年。火箭邮件真的很棒。

Paul Buchheit: But anyway, I had grand visions for it. But my approach to developing it was  wrong. It was very much like, I had this great big grand vision, and then  I started trying to implement it, piece by piece, the components, and then I got  bored and gave up.

Paul Buchheit: 但不管怎样，我对它有着宏伟的愿景。但是我开发它的方法是错误的。这就像，我有一个伟大的宏伟愿景，然后我开始尝试实现它，一个接一个，组件，然后我感到无聊和放弃。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's actually a multi-person job to build email. Yeah, it's a lot of work,  but-

Geoff Ralston: 是的，这实际上是一份多人的工作，用来制作电子邮件。是啊，工作很多，但是-

Paul Buchheit: It's a lot of stuff, but the way I went about it, was wrong. Because  I actually did this detailed design or this very intricate system and everything. And at  least for myself, I've come to decide that that doesn't work, and this is what  we preach to the startups is, "Figure out what you can launch today." And so  to jump forward to Google, it was 2001, there was a big reorg, where they  got rid of all the managers, and just gave engineers more of a free range  engineering thing, gave us all projects. And so they were just, I should build an  email thing. They knew I had an interest in email, whatever, but it was just  like we want to do something in email, we don't really know what exactly like,  just go build it. So having learned from my prior experience, I decided to ...  I know I have a short attention span, so the very first version of Gmail  I wrote in a day, and it wasn't really good. But I had previously been  working at Google Groups, which was a Usenet search at the time, now it's something  different, but I took the code that I've been working on for that, and then  I just took all of my email and shoved it into that database, into that  indexing engine. And then, I had an email search, and then I just-

Paul Buchheit: 这是很多事情，但我的方式是错误的。因为我实际上做了这个详细的设计或者这个非常复杂的系统什么的。至少对我自己来说，我已经意识到这是行不通的，这就是我们向创业公司宣扬的，“想想你今天能推出什么。”因此，为了跳进谷歌，那是2001年的一次大重组，他们摆脱了所有的经理，只是给工程师们更多的自由范围工程，给了我们所有的项目。所以他们只是，我应该建立一个电子邮件的东西。他们知道我对电子邮件感兴趣，但这就像我们想在电子邮件中做些什么一样，我们不知道到底是什么样子，去构建它吧。所以从我以前的经历中学到了我决定.。我知道我的注意力持续时间很短，所以我在一天内写的Gmail的第一个版本，并不是很好。但我以前曾在谷歌集团工作，当时这是一个Usenet搜索，现在情况不同了，但我把我一直在做的代码拿来，然后我把所有的电子邮件都塞进数据库，放到索引引擎中。然后，我进行了电子邮件搜索，然后我就.

Geoff Ralston: So your first thing was just an email you could search.

Geoff Ralston: 所以你的第一件事就是一封你可以搜索的电子邮件。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, and so then I emailed that out to the engineering team, I'm, "Hey, I  built this email search, let me know what you think." And then people reply, "Yeah,  it's okay, but it would be better with my email instead of yours." So I'm,  "All right, I have a feature request." So version zero, only searched my email, and  then the next version, I made it so it would search other people's email-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，然后我发邮件给工程团队，我是，“嘿，我建立了这个电子邮件搜索，让我知道你的想法。”然后人们回答说：“是的，没关系，但最好是用我的电子邮件而不是你的电子邮件。”所以我，“好吧，我有一个特征要求。”所以第零版，只搜索我的邮件，然后下一个版本，我制作了它，这样它就可以搜索别人的电子邮件-

Geoff Ralston: There's a stunning lesson in there, I think, which is, the point wasn't so much  that whose email was being searched. It was that email was being searched. You guys  got to realize back then you couldn't really search email, or you could do is  find the email you wanted, and click on it. So searching was a thing.

Geoff Ralston: 我认为，这里面有一个令人震惊的教训，那就是，重点不在于谁的电子邮件被搜索了。那封邮件是被搜查的。你们必须意识到，那时你不能真正搜索电子邮件，或者你可以找到你想要的电子邮件，然后点击它。所以搜索是一回事。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, and I figured, I mean, a lot of our emails and comments. So it  sort of works, right. We're on a lot of the same mailing lists, everyone [crosstalk]  . So yeah, so then version two is just it indexes other people's email and  so I sent that out, and they'd be, "All right, this is cool. Now, I  want to be able to reply to one of the messages." All right, feature request,  right? And so the whole thing was just iterating, to step by step, trying to  make something that would make people happy. And so we actually had as our launch  gate, this idea that we needed to have 100 happy users inside of Google, because,  we hadn't it launched it to the world, obviously. And so I actually embedded in  the interface, this thing will pop up and be, "Are you happy? Yes, or no?"  It was just a single question. Are you happy with Gmail? Or it was at  the time known as caribou? Yes or no? And it would get a list then,  I would look at, of who said yes, and who said no. And then I'd  go to all the nos and be, "What's it going to take to make you  a happy user?" Right? And actually just get them one at a time, and some  of the people they're, "It basically has to be a clone of Outlook." I'm like,  Well, you're never going to be a happy user.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我想，我是说，我们的很多电子邮件和评论。所以这是可行的，对吧。我们在很多相同的邮件列表上，每个人[相声]。所以是的，所以第二版只是索引其他人的电子邮件，所以我发送出去，他们会说，“好吧，这很酷。现在，我想回复其中一条信息。”好吧，特征请求，对吧？所以整件事只是在迭代，一步地，试图制造一些能让人们快乐的东西。所以我们实际上有一个想法，那就是我们需要在Google里面拥有100个快乐的用户，因为，很明显，我们还没有把它推向世界。所以我实际上嵌入了界面，这个东西会弹出，“你高兴吗？是的，还是不是？”这只是一个问题。你对Gmail满意吗？或者当时叫驯鹿？是还是不？然后它会得到一个清单，我会看看，谁说是，谁说不。然后我会对所有的人说：“要想让你成为一个快乐的用户，需要做些什么？”对吗？实际上，一次只给他们一个，一些人，他们，“基本上，它必须是一个克隆的Outlook。”我就像，嗯，你永远不会是一个快乐的用户。

Geoff Ralston: You are dead to me.

Geoff Ralston: 你对我来说已经死了。

Paul Buchheit: I know. I did end up getting those people. And the way I would get  them is that Outlook at the time, when you would hit two gigabytes in your  mail file, it would corrupt the database, and they would lose all of their mail.  And then I had the only copy of their email. And so then they would  become a Gmail user, not always a happy user, but they would become a user.  But anyway, other people, it would just be a minor thing, where I just need  to add one feature, or fix a bug or something, and then they'll be happy.  And so we slugged through, just one user at a time, until we got to  100 happy users.

保罗：我知道。最后我得到了那些人。我得到它们的方式是Outlook，当你在你的邮件文件中达到2G时，它会破坏数据库，他们会丢失所有的邮件。然后我拿到了他们的电子邮件的唯一副本。因此，他们将成为一个Gmail用户，不总是一个快乐的用户，但他们将成为一个用户。但是无论如何，其他人，这只是一件小事，我只需要添加一个特性，或修复一个bug或其他什么，然后他们会很高兴。所以我们一次只使用一个用户，直到我们有了100个快乐的用户。

Geoff Ralston: Is that the genesis of what we call at YC, the Buchheit rule, maybe you  can just tell these guys what-

Geoff Ralston: 这就是我们所谓的YC，Buchheit规则的起源吗？也许你可以告诉这些家伙-

Paul Buchheit: [crosstalk] -

Paul Buchheit：[相声]-

Geoff Ralston: It's better to have-

Geoff Ralston: 最好是-

Paul Buchheit: Right. So, one of the ideas is when you're starting out building something new, especially  if you're going into an established category, like email, literally email was like 30 years  old, when we started on it, right? So there is a lot of history and  a lot of opinions about how email should be, and people would sometimes angrily tell  me, I'm doing it wrong, because we made the reply on top instead of the  bottom, weird stuff like that. And so there's all this history. So it's pretty much  impossible to enter a space like that, and make a thing that appeals to everyone.  And if you try to do that, what you end up making is just a  mediocre product that nobody really loves. And so my philosophy and what we try to  get all the startups to do is figure out a thing that will just have  really deep appeal, even if it's to a tiny fraction of people, if you can  make that small fraction of people just obsessively love what you're doing, it's easier to  then grow that group, because, there's always people at the margin, where if I just  make something slightly better, they're going to join into that group. So it's easier to  start with that like that deep but narrow appeal, and then broaden it over time  than it is to start with just broad me, and then try to convert people  from me to loving your thing in mass.

Paul Buchheit: 对。所以，其中一个想法是，当你开始建立新的东西时，尤其是当你进入一个既定的类别，比如电子邮件，从字面上说，电子邮件就像30年前，当我们开始使用它的时候，对吧？所以，关于电子邮件应该是什么样子，有很多历史和很多观点，人们有时会生气地告诉我，我做错了，因为我们在顶部而不是底部，做出了类似的奇怪的事情。所以有这么多的历史。所以，要进入这样的空间，做一个吸引每个人的东西是不可能的。如果你试图做到这一点，你最终所做的只是一个平庸的产品，没有人真正喜欢它。所以我的哲学，以及我们试图让所有的创业公司去做的，就是找出一件有很大吸引力的事情，即使对一小部分人来说，如果你能让那一小部分人痴迷于你所做的事情，那就更容易成长这个群体，因为，总有一些人在边缘，如果我能做一些更好的事情，他们就会加入到这个群体中来。所以，从那种深而狭窄的吸引力开始，然后随着时间的推移扩大它，比仅仅从宽我开始，然后试着让人们从我转变为爱你的东西，在大众中变得更容易。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, I've been thinking about that lately. Just in terms of retention. If you get  100 people who never leave, that's a great place to start than if you have  thousands of people, all of them turn eventually.

Geoff Ralston: 是的，我最近一直在考虑这个问题。只是为了保持。如果你有100个从不离开的人，那是一个很好的开始，如果你有成千上万的人，他们最终都会转向。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So Gmail happened, and then you left.

Geoff Ralston: 好的。所以Gmail发生了然后你就离开了。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, so Gmail happened, and yeah, a couple years later, I left the company. It  was becoming a big company again, and I just decided that wasn't the direction I  personally wanted to go. And I just had a baby who had a pretty dramatic  start at life. So I had other things going on. So actually, around that same  time, actually, even before I left Google, I was again reading Slashdot, because that was  where I got all of my information. And I saw this thing about the Summer  Founders Program, which I thought sounded super cool, because I'm only just looking for an  idea, that's actually novel.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，所以Gmail发生了，是的，几年后，我离开了公司。它再次成为一家大公司，我只是觉得这不是我个人想要的方向。我刚生了个孩子，他的人生开始很有戏剧性。所以我还有别的事情要做。实际上，大约在同一时间，实际上，甚至在我离开谷歌之前，我还在读Slashdot，因为那是我获得所有信息的地方。我看到了这个关于暑期创办人计划的东西，我觉得这听起来很酷，因为我只是在寻找一个想法，这其实很新奇。

Geoff Ralston: And for those of you don't know, the Summer Founders Program, that's YC. That's Caribou.

Geoff Ralston: 对于那些不知道的人来说，暑期创办人项目就是YC。那是加勒比。

Paul Buchheit: Right. That ended up being YC batch Summer '05, that's the one that had Reddit,  and a bunch of companies that did [crosstalk] , Sam's company, Justin and Emmett's company,  Kiko, were all in that batch. So I saw that-

Paul Buchheit: 对。最后是YC Batch Summ‘05，那是Reddit的公司，还有很多公司(相声)，Sam的公司，Justin和Emmett的公司Kiko，都在那一批。所以我看到-

Geoff Ralston: Justin Kan is the founder of Justin.tv and Twitch and atrium.

Geoff Ralston: 贾斯汀·菅直人是Justin.tv、Twitc和中庭的创始人。

Paul Buchheit: So yeah, a few things.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，有几件事。

Geoff Ralston: A few things.

Geoff Ralston: 几件事。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. So I was just really interested. I didn't know Paul Graham, or any of  these guys. So I was just keeping it on my radar, I'm really excited to  see. And part of that was my own experience, being there in Ohio, and thinking  I'm excited about startups, and I wouldn't even know where to begin, right? Because if  you go to Stanford, your roommate probably has a startup or something like it, it's  just in the water. But if you're from someplace else, if you're not from Silicon  Valley, if you're not from this environment, it feels like you're just excluded, and I  really liked the idea that it was just this open thing, anyone in the world,  you didn't have to know anyone, you could just submit an application. And they were  going to bring you in. And so that idea-

Paul Buchheit: 是的。所以我真的很感兴趣。我不认识保罗·格雷厄姆或者其他人。所以我只是把它放在我的雷达上，我很兴奋地看到。其中一部分是我自己的经历，在俄亥俄州，我认为我对初创公司很兴奋，我甚至不知道从哪里开始，对吗？因为如果你去斯坦福，你的室友可能有一家创业公司或类似的东西，它只是在水里。但是，如果你来自其他地方，如果你不是来自硅谷，如果你不是来自这个环境，我觉得你只是被排斥在外，我真的很喜欢这样的想法，世界上的任何人，你不需要认识任何人，你只需要提交一份申请。他们要把你带进来。所以这个想法-

Geoff Ralston: Turns out startup school's the same way now.

Geoff Ralston: 原来创业学校现在也是这样。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's the idea that I think really resonated with me, is  that it was opening it up to everyone, even if you're not an insider or  something. So I followed them pretty closely. I was one of the very first Reddit  users, I think, when that launched, and then-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，没错。我的意思是，这是我认为真正与我产生共鸣的想法，那就是它向每个人开放，即使你不是一个内部人或什么的。所以我非常密切地跟踪他们。我是第一批Reddit用户之一，我想，当它发布的时候，然后-

Geoff Ralston: Did you go to the Demo Day?

Geoff Ralston: 你去了演示日吗？

Paul Buchheit: No, I didn't make it to the very first one.

Paul Buchheit: 不，我没有做到第一次。

Geoff Ralston: Is that the only one you ever missed.

Geoff Ralston: 那是你唯一错过的。

Paul Buchheit: That's the only one I missed. I've been to every Demo Day, except the first.

Paul Buchheit: 这是我唯一错过的。我去过每个演示日，除了第一天。

Geoff Ralston: Paul actually has the distinction of having been to more demo days than anyone.

Geoff Ralston: 保罗确实比任何人都有去过更多的演示时间的区别。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。

Geoff Ralston: Than anyone, including P.G and Jessica.

Geoff Ralston: 比任何人都要好，包括P.G和杰西卡。

Paul Buchheit: I don't know if it's a good distinction but-

Paul Buchheit: 我不知道这是不是个好区别，但是-

Geoff Ralston: It is a distinction.

Geoff Ralston: 这是一个区别。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, it is a distinction. So yeah, then that fall, they announced, P.G put out  this thing, "Hey, for the second batch, we're going to do it in Mountain View,  in this room, it turns out." And so I was like, "Oh, that's cool." I  just dropped them. I didn't know them. I send a cold email, introduced myself, I'm,  "Hey, if I can help out in any way, just let me know." So he's,  "Yeah, come on, by." And I started just attending the dinners, and actually made my  very first angel investment in a company in the second batch winter '06, which was  Kevin Hale, who then later became a YC partner Wufoo, which is a form filler,  it isn't a company that IPOed, it actually turned out to be really good investment.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，这是一种区别。所以是的，然后在那个秋天，他们宣布，P.G推出了这个东西，“嘿，第二批，我们要在山景城做，在这个房间里，结果证明。”所以我说，“哦，这很酷。”我刚把它们掉了。我不认识他们。我发了一封冷冰冰的电子邮件，自我介绍说：“嘿，如果我能帮上什么忙的话，请告诉我。”所以他说，“是的，来吧，顺便。”我刚开始参加晚宴，在06年冬天的第二次投资中，我做了第一笔天使投资，那就是凯文·黑尔，他后来成为YC的合伙人吴福，这是一种形式上的填充，它不是一家IPOed公司，它实际上是一项非常好的投资。

Geoff Ralston: Nice first win.

Geoff Ralston: 不错的第一场胜利。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I forget what the multiple is, but pretty high.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我忘了倍数是多少，但很高。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, my first investment returned like 10 X. And it was actually a little unfortunate,  because it made me think I was better at it than I was.

Geoff Ralston: 是的，我的第一笔投资回报率达到了10倍。这确实有点不幸，因为它让我觉得自己比以前更擅长投资。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, it was maybe like 50 X, something-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，大概是50倍，大概-

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Not bad.

Geoff Ralston: 是的。还不错。

Paul Buchheit: So that was how I got hooked into this stuff. So I started at that  point, just getting to know the founders and each batch. And I've invested in every  batch since then, at least a few of the companies.

Paul Buchheit: 这就是我迷上这些东西的原因。所以我就从那时开始，了解创始人和每一批人。从那以后，我投资了每一批，至少有几家公司。

Geoff Ralston: And how did FriendFeed emerge during that time?

Geoff Ralston: 在这段时间里，FriendFeed是如何出现的？

Paul Buchheit: So yeah, after I left Google, I sort of retired and then would just get  depressed because it turns out-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，在我离开谷歌之后，我有点退休了，然后就会变得沮丧，因为事实证明-

Geoff Ralston: Retirement's not fun.

Geoff Ralston: 退休不好玩。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. And maybe I have issues with depression, I don't know. But working distracts me,  so I started talking some other friends from Google who were thinking of leaving, and  basically ended up starting a new company, which was FriendFeed, and the actual goal of  FriendFeed was was just to build a place that was really awesome to work at,  I was actually just trying to create a job for myself.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。也许我有抑郁症的问题，我不知道。但是工作分散了我的注意力，所以我开始和谷歌的一些朋友聊天，他们想要离开，结果基本上是创办了一家新公司，也就是FriendFeed，而FriendFeed的实际目标就是建立一个非常棒的工作场所，实际上我只是想为自己创造一个工作岗位。

Geoff Ralston: Were you trying to recreate what it felt like when you were at Google in  the early days.

Geoff Ralston: 你是否试图重现早期你在谷歌时的感觉。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, the best of parts, because there was also a lot of stuff about Google  that I found just tremendously frustrating. And so I had this idea that we could  take the good parts and not the bad parts. It's a little bit naive, but  that was the hope and managed to get an incredibly strong team, mostly of a  former group of people.

Paul Buchheit：是的，最好的部分，因为还有很多关于Google的东西，我觉得非常令人沮丧。所以我有一个想法，我们可以选择好的部分，而不是坏的部分。这是有点天真，但这是希望，并设法得到了一个难以置信的强大的团队，大部分是前一组人。

Geoff Ralston: Did you ever feel like, I mean, FriendFeed, it went fine, but it didn't obviously  end up becoming like 100 billion dollar company. Did you ever feel you could pinpoint  what was missing from the beginnings of friend feed that might have led you on  that path? Or was there a grand vision? Was that missing?

Geoff Ralston: 你有没有想过，我是说，FriendFeed，一切都很好，但它显然没有变成1000亿美元的公司。你是否曾经感觉到，你可以从朋友饲料的开端中找出可能导致你走上这条道路的缺失之处？还是有宏伟的愿景？那个不见了吗？

Paul Buchheit: I'd say explosive growth was missing. For those of you who don't know it was  it was a social network, we actually created the like button, so the very first  like button was on FriendFeed and then mysteriously appeared on Facebook a number of months  later. They-

Paul Buchheit: 我想说，爆炸式的增长已经消失了。对于那些不知道这是一个社交网络的人来说，我们实际上创造了一个类似的按钮，所以第一个类似的按钮出现在FriendFeed上，几个月后又神秘地出现在Facebook上。他们-

Geoff Ralston: Coincidence [crosstalk] .

Geoff Ralston: 巧合[相声]。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I know. Anyway, social stuff is just really hard. We've had a lot of  social stuff come through YC, Google has tried it, it's a really hard space, somehow  some of these things, Twitter or Facebook, they just catch, and you can go back  in time and make up a bunch of stories about why it is. And some  of those stories may or may not be true, but it's one of these things  that I think is one of the hardest product categories to engineer success. But actually,  I will answer your question, which is that I did come to realize this, because  in the process of trying to make FriendFeed a success, we kept running into this  company, Facebook, who actually knew what they were doing, and part of why ultimately, I  came to believe that Facebook, which is this unstoppable force and that we weren't going  to beat them, and Google wasn't going to beat them, and Twitter wasn't going to  beat them, certainly not my space, right? None of these people are going to stop  them is, having competed with them, you start to realize, "Oh, they're really good at  this." Right? That was why I sold FriendFeed to Facebook, because I'm like, "Wow, this  is going to be another Google size-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我知道。总之，社交活动真的很难。我们有很多社交活动通过YC，谷歌已经尝试过了，这是一个非常困难的空间，有些东西，Twitter或Facebook，它们都很吸引人，你可以回到过去，编出一大堆关于它的故事。有些故事可能是真的，也可能不是真的，但我认为这是成功最难的产品类别之一。但实际上，我会回答你的问题，那就是我意识到了这一点，因为在努力使FriendFeed成功的过程中，我们不断地遇到这家公司，Facebook，他实际上知道他们在做什么，我最终也相信了Facebook，这是一股势不可挡的力量，我们不会打败他们，谷歌也不会打败他们，Twitter也不会打败他们，肯定不是我的地盘，对吧？这些人都不会阻止他们，在和他们竞争之后，你开始意识到，“哦，他们真的很擅长这个。”对吗？所以我才把FriendFeed卖给Facebook，因为我说，“哇，这将是谷歌的另一个规模-

Geoff Ralston: Because they were the best at what you were doing.

Geoff Ralston: 因为他们是你所做的最好的。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。

Geoff Ralston: Google was a best in the world at what they were doing, when you were  there, And they were the best in the world, and you weren't.

Geoff Ralston: 谷歌是世界上最好的，当你在那里的时候，他们是世界上最好的，而你却不是。

Paul Buchheit: Right. And so I was just like I should go there, because it's going to  be, first of all, I feel like another one of these Google size companies, and  then hopefully, I can learn how they do it. And I think like being there  and reflecting on it, one realization I had, is that we brought ... Google always  had a very product-oriented mindset. We would try to build products that were what the  user wants. So it was-

Paul Buchheit: 对。所以我就像我应该去的那样，因为首先，我觉得自己是谷歌规模的另一家公司，然后我希望我能了解他们是如何做到的。我想就像在那里思考，我有一种感觉，就是我们带来了.谷歌一直有一种非常注重产品的思维方式。我们会尝试构建用户想要的产品。所以是-

Geoff Ralston: And you guys were your users, you build product, like you said, you build Gmail  originally for Google people.

Geoff Ralston: 你们是你们的用户，你们制造产品，就像你说的，你们建立Gmail最初是为了谷歌人。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, sure. And so with FriendFeed it was the same thing of, we're just thinking  about, what do I want? And I think one of the really powerful insights that  they had at Facebook was that it's almost it's not the end user who you  have to please, it's the network, because they understood that the most important feature of  a social network is that your friends are there. And so sometimes there's actually a  tension between what's good for the individual and what's good for the network? And they  would always do what's good for the network.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，当然。和FriendFeed一样，我们只是在想，我想要什么？我认为他们在Facebook上最有影响力的洞见之一是，这几乎不是你必须取悦的最终用户，而是网络，因为他们明白社交网络最重要的特点是你的朋友在那里。所以有时候对个人有好处的和对网络有好处的东西之间会有一种紧张的关系？他们总是做对网络有益的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Do you think that's just specific to network effect businesses, social media? Or is that  a more general rule, do you think? Like an enterprise product, probably doesn't need to  think about-

Geoff Ralston: 你认为这仅仅是针对网络效应企业，社交媒体吗？还是说这是个更普遍的规则，你觉得呢？就像企业产品，可能不需要考虑-

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, enterprise has some of the similar thing where you have to make  the buyer happy, not the end user, which is, I think a lot of times  why enterprise software is not really lovely to use, is because the person using it  isn't the person making the buying decision.

Paul Buchheit：是的，我的意思是，企业有一些类似的东西，你必须让买家高兴，而不是最终用户，这就是，我认为很多时候，企业软件不是真正可爱的使用，是因为使用它的人不是做出购买决定的人。

Geoff Ralston: So both cases, you have to have a meta level where you're ... We always  talk about making something people want, but people, you have to think more broadly than  just the end user, it's everyone who's involved in the system.

Geoff Ralston: 所以这两种情况，你必须有一个元水平，你在.我们总是在谈论做一些人们想要的东西，但是人们，你必须考虑得更广泛，不仅仅是最终用户，而是每个人都参与了这个系统。

Paul Buchheit: Right. People get this wrong a lot of times where they think there's this meme  out there that oh, if you're not paying, you're the product, not the customer, whatever.  But it really isn't, right, you have to identify who's happiness makes you successful. So  for Google, it really is the end, the people using Google search, if they go  to a different search engine, there's Google script, right? You have to keep those people  happy. And with the enterprise example, it's whoever the buyer is, I think the subtle  thing with Facebook was that what makes those people happy, is that you have this  huge network, right?

Paul Buchheit: 对。很多时候，人们会错误地认为这是一种模因-哦，如果你不付钱，你就是产品，而不是顾客。但事实并非如此，你必须确定谁的幸福才能让你成功。所以对谷歌来说，这真的是结束了，使用谷歌搜索的人，如果他们使用不同的搜索引擎，就会有谷歌脚本，对吧？你得让那些人开心。以企业为例，无论买家是谁，我认为Facebook的微妙之处在于，让这些人感到高兴的是，你拥有这个庞大的网络，对吧？

Geoff Ralston: That's efficient and easy to use, and-

Geoff Ralston: 这既高效又易用，而且-

Paul Buchheit: Right. And so you really have to think in terms of almost what the network  wants, which is a different way of thinking, yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 对。所以你必须考虑一下网络想要什么，这是一种不同的思维方式，是的。

Geoff Ralston: So, FriendFeed was bought by Facebook, and so you landed in Facebook? Did it have  a similar feel too? I guess Facebook was a little bigger by the time you  get bought, but did it have a have a Google feel, then?

Geoff Ralston: 那么，FriendFeed是被Facebook买下的，所以你登陆了Facebook？它也有类似的感觉吗？我想Facebook在你被买的时候有点大了，但是它有谷歌的感觉吗？

Paul Buchheit: I mean, there are a lot of people from Google. So yes, they, "Hi." Former  co-workers. Similarities and differences. So again, one of the reasons I was excited to go  there was just like I had this experience going through Google, and it's very easy  to overgeneralize, "Oh, wow, the reason we were successful is we had brightly colored balls."  Or something like that. You can make up all of these rationalizations for what made  you a success, but in retrospect, everything looks different-

Paul Buchheit：我的意思是，有很多人来自谷歌。所以是的，他们，“嗨”以前的同事。相同点和不同点。所以，我很兴奋去那里的原因之一，就像我在谷歌上有过这样的经历，这很容易被过分概括，“哦，哇，我们成功的原因是我们有着色彩鲜艳的球。”或者类似的东西。你可以用所有这些理由来证明你的成功，但回想起来，一切看起来都不一样了-

Geoff Ralston: The truth is-

Geoff Ralston: 事实是-

Paul Buchheit: I think the majority of the reasons you come up with are probably wrong. There's  a few key things. I will say, though, that going into the office, it had  that vibe of, "This is a place that's going somewhere." Right? And I think it's  a really powerful indicator. And it's a subtle thing. And it's a little bit almost  metaphysical, or everybody, you walk into an office and you're just, "How's the energy? How  does it make me feel? When I watch my own energy levels, am I going  up? Is this making me feel like, Oh, wow. Or is this pulling me down?  Am I depressed?" And I think the reason that works is because the employees actually  know what's going on, right? And so if you're just there, because you're collecting your  paycheck while you wait for the company to go bust, you're going to have a  different energy from-

Paul Buchheit: 我认为你提出的大多数理由可能都是错误的。有几件关键的事。不过，我要说的是，走进办公室时，我会有这样的感觉：“这是一个要去某个地方的地方。”对吗？我认为这是一个非常有力的指标。这是一件微妙的事情。它有点形而上学，或者每个人，你走进一个办公室，你只是，“精力如何？它让我感觉如何？当我看到自己的能量水平时，我在上升吗？这是让我感觉，哦，哇。还是这让我感到沮丧？”我认为工作的原因是因为员工确实知道发生了什么，对吗？所以如果你只是在那里，因为你在等待公司破产的时候领取你的薪水，你就会有一种不同于-

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, you feel that.

Geoff Ralston: 是的，你感觉到了。

Paul Buchheit: Versus if you think, "Oh my God, I got to launch this thing, it's going  to be so exciting, it's going to take over the world." It's just a very  exciting feeling to have these products, when we were building Gmail and maps and stuff,  there was this feeling, this palpable feeling of, "This is going to blow people's minds  when we put it out there, right?" And that's a real exciting thing.

Paul Buchheit: 如果你认为，“哦，我的天，我要发射这个东西，它会非常令人兴奋，它将接管整个世界。”拥有这些产品是一种非常令人兴奋的感觉，当我们制作Gmail和地图之类的东西时，有一种感觉，这种明显的感觉是，“当我们把它放在那里的时候，这会让人们大吃一惊，对吗？”这真是件令人兴奋的事。

Geoff Ralston: So part of the energy comes from these amazing products that you're building, but it  seems like part of that has to come from the founders and just the attitude  that they bring, the belief that they bring, whether it's soccer, Larry and Sergey or-

Geoff Ralston: 所以能量的一部分来自于你正在打造的这些令人惊叹的产品，但其中的一部分似乎必须来自创始人，他们带来的态度，他们带来的信念，不管是足球，拉里和谢尔盖，还是-

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think there has to be a founder conviction, they have  to believe in what they're doing, and not that they're just chasing after some trend,  like, "Oh, I read an article in TechCrunch, I'm going to go off in a  new direction." I mean, I actually think Zack is probably the most extreme example of  this, I've seen, I almost feel like the whole world could tell him he's wrong,  and he'd be, "No, not really." And this is really reflected in some of the  I think internal mythology of the company. There's a really interesting, and this is before  my time, but back when they were just a college social network, they had something  like 10,000,000 users, which for social network isn't that much, and Yahoo wanted to buy  them for a billion dollars. And everyone is, "You should take the money, it's a  billion dollars, it's a lot of money."

Paul Buchheit: 是的，当然。我的意思是，我认为必须有一个创立者的信念，他们必须相信他们在做什么，而不是说他们只是在追逐某种趋势，比如，“哦，我在TechCrunch上读了一篇文章，我要往一个新的方向走。”我的意思是，我认为扎克可能是这方面最极端的例子，我看到，我几乎觉得全世界都可以告诉他错了，他会说，“不，不完全是。”我认为公司内部的神话确实反映了这一点。有一个非常有趣的东西，这是在我的时代之前，但是当他们还是一个大学的社交网络的时候，他们有大约1000万的用户，对于社交网络来说并没有那么多，而雅虎想以10亿美元的价格买下他们。每个人都是，“你应该把钱拿走，这是10亿美元，这是一大笔钱。”

Geoff Ralston: He actually took the money, but then it changed.

Geoff Ralston: 他实际上拿走了钱，但后来钱变了。

Paul Buchheit: And then they-

Paul Buchheit: 然后他们-

Geoff Ralston: Then it changed [crosstalk] , and he didn't want to, there's pressure on him to  take.

Geoff Ralston: 然后一切都变了(相声)，他不想这么做，他承受着压力。

Paul Buchheit: Right. So everyone around him was pressuring him to take the deal, and then-

Paul Buchheit: 对。所以他周围的每个人都在向他施压，让他接受交易，然后-

Geoff Ralston: By the way, if you get offered a billion dollars, take the deal.

Geoff Ralston: 顺便说一句，如果你收到10亿美元的报价，那就接受交易吧。

Paul Buchheit: Right.

Paul Buchheit: 对。

Geoff Ralston: In case you have any doubts.

Geoff Ralston: 如果你有任何疑问的话。

Paul Buchheit: Right. And so finally, yeah, I mean, ultimately turns it down, basically replaces his entire  management team after that, because they were all, "We should sell, we should sell." And  so he brought in people who may be believed a little bit more. Oh, and  then there's ... Actually, the story I meant to tell wasn't even that, it was  that when they launched the News Feed, which was around the same time, and people  were furious. And so again, they were something like 10 million users, something like 8  million of them joined a group protesting it. It's impossible to get that percentage of  your users to do anything, even if you want them to. Sort of suddenly have  the majority of your users revolting or whatever. And they're just, "No, I think people  are going to come around on this." And they were right, obviously, the newsfeed was  a fundamental thing. But that required

Paul Buchheit: 对。最后，是的，我的意思是，最终拒绝了，基本上取代了他的整个管理团队，因为他们都是，“我们应该卖，我们应该卖。”所以他引进了更多被相信的人。哦，然后.事实上，我想讲的故事甚至不是这个，而是当他们在同一时间发布新闻源的时候，人们都很愤怒。再一次，他们大概有1000万用户，其中大约有800万加入了一个抗议组织。这是不可能让你的百分比的用户做任何事情，即使你希望他们这样做。突然间，你的大多数用户都反感了。他们只是说，“不，我想人们会在这个问题上走过来的。”他们是对的，很明显，新闻报道是一件基本的事情。但这需要

Geoff Ralston: The News Feed is Facebook for most people, am I right?

Geoff Ralston: 对于大多数人来说，新闻源是脸书，对吗？

Paul Buchheit: Right, of course.

Paul Buchheit: 好的，当然。

Geoff Ralston: There's nothing else.

Geoff Ralston: 没有别的了。

Paul Buchheit: But I mean, that requires, I think, a pretty high level of conviction, when essentially  all of your users are furious at you, and you're, "No, I think you're going  to come around on this."

Paul Buchheit：但我的意思是，我认为，这需要相当高的信念，当你的所有用户都对你愤怒时，你会说：“不，我认为你会在这个问题上解决问题。”

Geoff Ralston: For somewhat unclear reasons, this reminds me of another Paul Buchheitism, which is that Sam  actually repeated in his introduction to the course, which was that, what a company really  needs is frugality, focus, obsession, and love. And it seems like, if you encapsulate those  things, even in the very beginning, and you think about leaders like Zack, they go  together and make sense.

Geoff Ralston: 由于一些不清楚的原因，这让我想起了另一个保罗·布奇主义，那就是山姆在课程的介绍中重复了一遍，那就是，一家公司真正需要的是节俭、专注、痴迷和爱。看起来，如果你把这些东西封装起来，即使是在一开始，你就会想到像扎克这样的领导者，他们会走到一起，变得有意义。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think focus is one of the most important things because as a startup,  it's actually, I think, your most powerful weapon, right? The reason that you're able to  take on these big companies, or whatever, is because they're doing 1000 different things, right?  And so the only way you can win is if you take everything you have,  and you focus it at one point, right? Because you are underpowered in every way,  versus these other companies, so the one thing you do have, that they don't have  is, you can be absolutely 100% focused on the thing that you're doing. With Google,  that was part of the reason that we won at search was that was all  we were focused on, early on, right?

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我认为专注是最重要的事情之一，因为作为一家初创公司，它实际上是你最强大的武器，对吗？你之所以能够对付这些大公司，或者其他什么，是因为他们做了1000件不同的事情，对吗？所以你唯一能赢的方法就是把你所有的东西都拿走，然后集中精力，对吧？因为你在各个方面都处于劣势，相对于其他公司，所以你有一件事，他们没有，那就是，你可以百分之百地专注于你正在做的事情。对于谷歌，这是我们在搜索中获胜的原因之一，这就是我们早期所关注的全部，对吗？

Geoff Ralston: And you became the best in the world at it.

Geoff Ralston: 你在这方面成为了世界上最好的。

Paul Buchheit: Right. Versus everyone else is, "Oh, we want to be a portal." Right? "We need  all this other [inaudible] ." So that's really key. Frugality, I think is also really  essential. I think one of the best in indicators of if you're doing it right,  is essentially your input to output ratio. So you want to do more with less.  Unfortunately, most startups do less with more. So you give them money, and they just  burn it up, and there's no results. So being able to produce a lot of  outputs with a minimum amount of time ans money-

Paul Buchheit: 对。与其他人相比，“哦，我们想成为一个门户。”对吗？“我们需要这一切[听不见]。”所以这才是关键。节俭，我认为也是很重要的。我认为最好的指标之一，如果你做得对，基本上是你的投入与产出的比率。所以你想用更少的钱做更多的事。不幸的是，大多数初创公司对更多的投资做得更少。所以你给他们钱，他们就把钱烧了，没有结果。所以用最少的时间和金钱就能产生很多输出-

Geoff Ralston: Mostly amplified.

Geoff Ralston: 大部分都是放大的。

Paul Buchheit: Right.

Paul Buchheit: 对。

Geoff Ralston: But you have to amplify the money.

Geoff Ralston: 但你必须放大这笔钱。

Paul Buchheit: Right. If you can get that ratio where it's I give you $1, and you  turn it into $10, my God, that's a good business, right? We just scale that  thing up.

Paul Buchheit: 对。如果你能得到这个比率，我给你1美元，然后你把它变成10美元，我的天，这是一个好生意，对吗？我们就把它放大。

Geoff Ralston: Even if it's $10 worth of something, like $10 worth of product, $10 worth of  innovation.

Geoff Ralston: 即使是10美元的东西，比如10美元的产品，10美元的创新。

Paul Buchheit: Right, and this goes back to always figuring out how to do things in the  absolutely minimal way, and it means this is one of the key startup things where  if you're not embarrassed of your product, you've waited too long to launch, these things  are at the route, there's a lot of like frugality there, right? Because you don't  want to spend too much time or too much money, you want to get it  out there as quickly as possible in as little cost.

保罗·布奇海特：对，这可以追溯到如何以极小的方式做事，这意味着这是一个关键的创业项目，如果你对你的产品不感到尴尬，你已经等了太久才推出，这些东西都在路上，有很多类似节俭的东西，对吗？因为你不想花太多的时间或太多的钱，所以你想以尽可能少的成本尽快得到它。

Geoff Ralston: Also you don't want to spend too much time on the wrong thing. And you  just don't know enough, right?

Geoff Ralston: 而且你也不想花太多时间在错误的事情上。你只是知道得不够，对吧？

Paul Buchheit: Right, exactly.

Paul Buchheit: 对，没错。

Geoff Ralston: You could have built too much email and you wouldn't have learned what to actually  build.

Geoff Ralston: 你本可以建立太多的电子邮件，而且你也不会学会实际构建什么。

Paul Buchheit: Right. It's easy to go completely off the rails, and one of the most surprising  things I've learned, just working with so many startups, is how often the cause of  death is too much money. I think there are companies that if they had not  been so well funded, could have been successful. And the company I like to make  fun of, not because they may have been successful, but just because it's funny to  laugh at is Juicero, the $700 juice bag squeezing machine. And the thing that made  that I think such a tremendous train wreck is that they gave them 120 million  dollars for that thing, before they ever like talk to any customer. If Juicero had  gone through YC and we gave them $120,000 they would have had to go talk  to a customer and be, "Hey, we want to sell you this $700 juice bag  squeezer, right? They would have had to talk to customers. And that's the thing like  we push so on the startups, you have to go talk ... I think I  just lost the mic. You have to go talk to your customers. It is so  easy to become detached and off in this bubble of delusion, and the problem with  having lots of funding before you're really ready for it, is that's exactly what happens.  So you can sell yourself on this idea, "Oh yeah, once we build the perfect  juice bag squeezer, we're going to take over the world, everyone's gonna want to spend  $700 I mean, plus you get this giant box in the mail that has 20  bags of juice in it, it's awesome. Everyone's going to want this." Right? And they're  able to live in that delusion for years because they never had to go out  and talk to customers.

Paul Buchheit: 对。这很容易完全偏离轨道，而我学到的最令人惊讶的事情之一，就是与这么多的初创公司合作，死亡的原因往往是太多的钱。我认为有些公司如果没有这么好的资金，可能会很成功。而我喜欢取笑的公司，不是因为他们可能成功了，而是因为笑起来很有趣，那就是Juicero，一台价值700美元的榨汁机。我认为这是一场巨大的火车事故，他们给了他们1.2亿美元，才愿意和任何顾客交谈。如果Juicero通过YC，我们给了他们12万美元，他们就得去找一个顾客，“嘿，我们想卖给你这个700美元的榨汁机，对吧？”他们就得和顾客谈谈。这就是我们推动创业的原因，你得去谈谈.我想我把麦克风弄丢了。你得去和你的顾客谈谈。在这种妄想的泡沫中，你很容易变得孤注一掷，而在你真正做好准备之前，拥有大量资金的问题是，这正是所发生的事情。所以你可以用这个想法来推销自己，“哦，是的，一旦我们建造了完美的果汁袋榨汁机，我们将接管世界，每个人都想花700美元-我的意思是，再加上你在邮件里有一个装有20袋果汁的巨型盒子，这太棒了。”每个人都会想要这个。“对吧？他们能够在这种错觉中生活多年，因为他们从来不需要出去和顾客交谈。”

Geoff Ralston: Right. If I recall, you could actually just recreate everything you did my just going  like that.

Geoff Ralston: 对。如果我还记得的话，你真的可以重现你做的每一件事，我就是这样做的。

Paul Buchheit: Right the reason for it ... So I cut up in one of the bags.  The reason is, I think to actually get it to work, they had to really  have macerate the fruit. So that's why I call it a juice bag squeezer, is  because it was actually already juiced. It was really just separating the pulp from the  juice. Which is why also it's no better than just going to the store and  buying juice. The whole thing was built on a number of flawed premises. But in  particular, you weren't really even juicing it, it has already been juiced, you're just straining  the juice.

Paul Buchheit: 正确的理由.所以我把一个袋子切开了。原因是，我认为要想让它真正发挥作用，他们就必须要把水果弄得干干净净。所以我叫它果汁袋榨汁机，因为它实际上已经被榨汁了。只是把果肉和果汁分开而已。这也是为什么它没有比去商店买果汁更好的原因。整件事都是建立在许多有缺陷的前提之上的。但特别是，你甚至没有真正榨汁，它已经被榨汁了，你只是在榨果汁。

Geoff Ralston: But there's a deep lesson there, which is, no matter what you raise, if you  raise $50,000 or 5,000,000, you should think of the amplification you need. If you raise  $5,000,000 that doesn't mean you can create $150,000 worth of value and be happy, you  have to create $50 million worth of value.

Geoff Ralston: 但是有一个深刻的教训，那就是，无论你筹集了什么，如果你筹集了5万或500万美元，你应该考虑到你需要的放大。如果你筹集了5，000，000美元，但这并不意味着你可以创造15万美元的价值和快乐，你必须创造5，000万美元的价值。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. It's easy. Again, I think to come up with stories in your mind about  how you're doing it, because once we released this juice squeezer, and that's why I  think you just have to stay close to the customers, you have to be out  there selling because you can just become delusional otherwise. And so that's why with startups,  I've just seen it again and again, if they get a huge round of funding  before they have product market fit, it kills the company. Because it's just too hard  for the founders to resist that. Because actually going out and dealing with the fact  that you don't have product market fit, it's really painful. It's easier to tell yourself  stories about how, "Oh yeah, we're killing it. I'm hiring. I just hired a whole  new team. We've got this cool office. There's all these ..."

Paul Buchheit: 是的。很简单再一次，我想在你脑海中想出你是如何做到的，因为一旦我们发布了这个榨汁机，这就是为什么我认为你必须保持与顾客的距离，你必须在外面销售，因为你可能会变得妄想症，否则。这就是为什么对于初创公司，我一次又一次地看到，如果他们在产品市场适合之前获得了一轮巨额资金，那就会扼杀公司。因为创始人很难抗拒。因为事实上，如果你不适应产品市场的情况，那就太痛苦了。很容易告诉自己，“哦，是的，我们要杀了它。我在招人。我刚雇了一个全新的团队。我们有一个很酷的办公室。有这么多.”

Geoff Ralston: Working at cool technology.

Geoff Ralston: 在酷技术公司工作。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, we're doing all this amazing stuff.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我们正在做所有这些令人惊奇的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Technology is great.

Geoff Ralston: 科技是伟大的。

Paul Buchheit: I'm in the press all the time, I go to conferences, I'm up on stage,  [inaudible] it's easy to just be completely detached from reality, because you're not out there  selling a thing, and you're creating a thing that people actually want to use.

Paul Buchheit：我一直在媒体上，我去参加会议，我站在舞台上，这很容易完全脱离现实，因为你没有在外面卖东西，你在创造一个人们真正想要使用的东西。

Geoff Ralston: We were talking earlier, it seems like there's this interesting juxtaposition that if you really  want to be creating an epic company, you have to be thinking about the future,  but you better be paying attention to the past, at the same time. Because there's  a lot of lessons to be learned about what goes wrong, more things go wrong,  than go right with startups-

Geoff Ralston: 我们之前谈过，似乎有一个有趣的并列：如果你真的想要创建一家史诗般的公司，你必须考虑未来，但你最好同时关注过去。因为有很多关于哪里出了问题，出了什么错的教训，而不是对初创公司的正确对待

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, that's just the past. But I think more importantly, the present. You  have to maintain a dual, a dream, or a vision of what that future is,  of something that gives you an orientation, "I need to head in that direction." I  think about the Lewis and Clark Expedition wherever they're, "We're going west, we're going that  direction." But you don't really know all the streams and rivers, and forests, and mountains,  you are going to have to cross along the way, right? So you have to  be very focused in the moment so that you don't get eaten by a bear  or something like that. But at the same time, you have to have that vision  of where you're headed. And so I think those are the two things-

Paul Buchheit: 是的，我是说，那只是过去。但我认为更重要的是现在。你必须保持一种双重的，一种梦想，或者一种对未来的憧憬，一个能给你一个方向的东西，“我需要朝着那个方向前进。”我想到刘易斯和克拉克远征，无论他们在哪里，“我们要往西走，我们要往那个方向走。”但是你并不了解所有的溪流河流森林和山脉，你必须沿着这条路穿越，对吗？所以你现在必须非常专注，这样你才不会被熊之类的东西吃掉。但与此同时，你必须要有你要去的方向的愿景。所以我认为这是两件事-

Geoff Ralston: [crosstalk] right?

Geoff Ralston: (相声)对吗？

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。

Geoff Ralston: Almost between just paying incredible attention to your current customers.

Geoff Ralston: 几乎是在对你现在的顾客给予难以置信的关注之间。

Paul Buchheit: Right.

Paul Buchheit: 对。

Geoff Ralston: And having take over the world-

Geoff Ralston: 接管了世界-

Paul Buchheit: Right. And I think the thing that happens with too much money is you just  spend all of your time dreaming of the promised land, but you're not actually dealing  with the problem that's in front of you.

Paul Buchheit: 对。我认为花太多钱发生的事情是，你只是把所有的时间都花在了梦寐以求的土地上，但实际上你并不是在处理摆在你面前的问题。

Geoff Ralston: I want to turn it over to Q and A, and we may have covered  most of this already, which is fine. But you've been spending a lot of time  with YC batch companies doing I think, what you're called 100 billion dollar office hours,  which my understanding is a way for you to help them think about what it  might mean to actually become an epic company. What are the other two or three  things maybe that we haven't talked about that you cover in those office hours? I  thought this would be like a group office hour or $100 billion office hour with  all of our startup school companies.

Geoff Ralston: 我想把它交给Q和A，我们可能已经讨论了大部分，这很好。但是你花了很多时间和YC批量公司一起做我想，你所谓的1000亿美元的办公时间，我的理解是帮助他们思考成为一家史诗般的公司可能意味着什么。其他的两三件事，也许我们还没有谈过，你在那些办公时间里还能做些什么呢？我以为这就像一个集体办公时间，或1000亿美元的办公时间，与我们所有的创业学校公司。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, so I thought a lot about, what is it that makes these companies that  are, Google, Netflix, Amazon, all these just huge companies, what is the thing that gets  you there and it's not, I don't think it's that you're smarter necessarily, and it  helps to be smart, it isn't that you're harder working, there's a limit to how  hard you can work, what I think necessarily to get to that point, you're sitting  on top of a big exponential change in reality or in the world. So Intel  and Microsoft, in the early days, Apple were sitting on top of this, the rise  of microcomputers. Right? And so what made Microsoft the big company is that they got  in early on microcomputers, and then they owned that space, right? Where the microcomputer operating  system, and they were able to ride that, if it weren't for microcomputers, they wouldn't  have been able to do that. And likewise, Google obviously, was sitting on the growth  of the internet, that the reason that Google made sense. Part of the reason other  people got it wrong was they weren't thinking about the fact that the amount of  information online was increasing exponentially. And so we were going to have to get a  lot better, or organizing it, right? Google's mission from the beginning is to organize and  make useful all the world's information. People are always surprised that they're aggressively gathering information.  It's right there in the mission statement. All the world's information.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，所以我想了很多，是什么让这些公司，谷歌，Netflix，Amazon，所有这些大公司，是什么东西把你带到了那里，而不是，我不认为你一定更聪明，而且聪明是有帮助的，这并不是说你在努力工作，你的努力程度是有限度的，我认为要达到这个程度，你坐在现实或世界上的一个巨大的指数变化之上。所以英特尔和微软，在早期，苹果就坐在这上面，微型计算机的崛起。对吗？微软之所以成为大公司，是因为他们很早就进入了微型计算机领域，然后他们拥有了这个空间，对吗？如果没有微型计算机的话，他们就不可能做到这一点。同样地，谷歌显然是坐在互联网的增长上，这也是谷歌之所以有意义的原因。其他人弄错的部分原因是他们没有考虑到网上信息量呈指数增长的事实。所以我们必须做得更好，或者组织起来，对吧？谷歌的任务从一开始就是组织和利用世界上所有的信息。人们总是惊讶于他们在积极地收集信息。就在任务声明里。世界上所有的信息。

Geoff Ralston: Shocking.

Geoff Ralston: 令人震惊。

Paul Buchheit: So what I try to have the founders, I give them a two part question,  and so the first part is let's say, I hop in my time machine, which  is hopefully a DeLorean and I travel 10 years into the future. So I get  out, it's the year 2028, I take a look around, I grab some nearby people  and talk to them or whatever. I asked questions, "What about the world of 2028  is fundamentally different from 2018? What's the thing that's totally different?" Right?

Paul Buchheit: 所以我想让创办人回答两个部分的问题，第一部分是，我跳上我的时间机器，希望这是一个DeLorean人，我在未来的10年里旅行。所以我出来了，是2028年，我四处看看，我抓住附近的一些人，和他们交谈，或者别的什么。我问了一些问题，“2028年的世界和2018年有根本的不同吗？有什么是完全不同的呢？”对吗？

Geoff Ralston: Donald Trump will no longer be president.

Geoff Ralston: 唐纳德·特朗普将不再担任总统。

Paul Buchheit: We don't really know the future. Now, you just completely derailed me.

Paul Buchheit: 我们真的不知道未来。现在，你完全把我弄出轨了。

Geoff Ralston: That was the first thing I'd have to.

Geoff Ralston: 这是我必须做的第一件事。

Paul Buchheit: Anyway, so the thing is, what I want them to do is identify the change,  and this should be as it pertains to their startup, because obviously, there's going to  be a bunch of changes, but as it pertains to your startup, but factoring out  your startup, because even if Facebook didn't exist, I guarantee someone would have built a  giant social network, right? Facebook was sitting on top of that exponential change, and they  were the ones who were most able to capture it, that position and hold on  to it. But if it wasn't them, I guarantee someone else would be in that  ecological space.

Paul Buchheit: 不管怎样，我想让他们做的是找出变化，这应该和他们的创业相关，因为很明显，会有很多变化，但因为它与你的创业有关，但考虑到你的创业公司，因为即使Facebook不存在，我保证有人会建立一个巨大的社交网络，对吧？Facebook正处于这种指数变化的顶端，他们是最能捕捉到这种变化的人，也是最能抓住它的人。但如果不是他们，我保证会有人在那个生态空间里。

Geoff Ralston: There's inevitability about-

Geoff Ralston: 这是不可避免的-

Paul Buchheit: There's inevitability, these companies will exist in some form. And maybe you're making it a  little bit faster, or a little bit better, or something like that, but that position  is going to exist. And then the second part of the question is simply, how  are you going to be the one who captures it? Right?

Paul Buchheit: 这是不可避免的，这些公司将以某种形式存在。也许你让它变得更快，或者更好，或者类似的东西，但是这个位置将会存在。然后问题的第二部分简单地说，你将如何成为捕捉它的人？对吗？

Geoff Ralston: Awesome.

Geoff Ralston: 太棒了。

Paul Buchheit: So let's do some Q and A. Any questions?
Speaker 3: [inaudible] , we found a way to change coffee. So that's actually going to switch  the entire market. I was wondering, what's the tipping point where you really approach the  market and know that you're going to convert a lot of it, for us in  customer interviews, about 80% of the people want to try what our product does. And  we even had people pay 40 bucks for a cup of coffee, I just take  my money give me-

Paul Buchheit：那么让我们做一些Q和A。有什么问题吗？演讲者3：(听不见)，我们找到了改变咖啡的方法。这实际上会改变整个市场。我在想，你真正接近市场的临界点是什么，你知道你会转换很多，对我们来说，在客户访谈中，大约80%的人想尝试我们的产品。我们甚至让人们花40美元买一杯咖啡，我就拿着我的钱给我-

Paul Buchheit: So what's your question?
Speaker 3: So how do you identify the tipping point? And really how you execute that tipping  point that gets a market to that 100 billion-

Paul Buchheit: 那么你的问题是什么？演讲者3：那么你是如何确定临界点的呢？你是如何实现这个临界点的，这个临界点能让市场达到1000亿-

Paul Buchheit: So the question is, how do you identify a tipping point for a market?
Speaker 3: And execute, really, how do you make sure that it's-

Paul Buchheit: 那么问题是，你如何确定一个市场的临界点？说话者3：执行，真的，你如何确保它是-

Paul Buchheit: I almost feel like this has being overthought. If you've got people who will pay  you $40 for a cup of coffee, I would just start selling $40 cups of  coffee. That sounds like a really good business. The tipping point is when you can't  keep up with demand, right? And so again, you don't find this by thinking about  it, if you think about it too much, you end up it just in delusional  land. You find out by talking to the market, and having them give you dollars,  and so it's like literally, when you're just scrambling to keep up with demand. And  that's the thing that you get into, in these hyper growth companies. One of the  biggest problems inside of Google is, we couldn't build data centers fast enough, right? Things  were just exploding so quickly, that you can even scale out, that's what tells you  that you have that.

Paul Buchheit: 我几乎觉得这件事有点过头了。如果有人愿意付你40美元买一杯咖啡，我就开始卖40美元的咖啡。听起来是个不错的生意。临界点是当你跟不上需求的时候，对吗？所以，再一次，你不会通过思考来发现这一点，如果你想的太多，你就会发现它只是在妄想的地方。你可以通过与市场的对话找到答案，让他们给你钱，所以这就像字面上说，你只是在争先恐后地跟上需求。在这些高速增长的公司里，这就是你要做的事情。谷歌内部最大的问题之一是，我们无法足够快地建立数据中心，对吗？事情发展得太快了，你甚至可以扩大规模，这就是你所拥有的。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, kind of hits you over the head, right? You don't have to give instruction  for when you're in hyper growth, you know you're there. In the back.
Speaker 4: [inaudible] Can you maybe advise on how [inaudible] ?

Geoff Ralston: 是啊，打了你的头，对吧？你不需要给出指示，当你处于高速增长的时候，你知道你在那里。在后面。演讲者4：(听不见的)你能给我建议一下如何(听不到)吗？

Geoff Ralston: Best practices for enterprise companies, where maybe you can't launch something that's really bad, because  there's requirements around security, et cetera.

GeoffRalston：针对企业公司的最佳实践，在那里您可能无法发布一些非常糟糕的东西，因为围绕安全性等都有需求。

Paul Buchheit: So the danger, I feel like with a lot of these enterprise things, is that  you end up not really solving an urgent problem, because when you talk to people,  they're, "Oh, yeah, it would be great to have this solution." Or whatever. And so  then you go off, and you build this thing, you spend years maybe building this  product, and then you go to them, you're, "Here it is, we got it." And  they're, "We're really busy this quarter, and actually we don't have it in the budget  until maybe next year. So can we talk again in nine months, or something?" Right?  That's deadly for a startup. So the way I try to think about it is  you want to find someone who has a really, urgent problem, right? And so the  analogy I like to use is, imagine that your arm is pinned underneath a boulder,  and you have two options. One option is to [inaudible] your own arm with your  teeth. Or the other option is to sign an LOI with this promising young startup,  right? That's the kind of customer you want, is someone who's like, desperate, right. And  because they're desperate, they're willing to put up with a shitty product, maybe, they're willing  to spend a lot of time working with you, right? And so actually, one of  the things that works really well, is if the founders are actually able to just  go into the organization and actually work there, that was how the very early Stripe  installs, Patrick Collison would show up and integrate Stripe into your code. He would just  show up and do the work. And so that's a good thing, and if they're  not really eager to have you come in and integrate into their systems or talk  to their people or whatever, maybe they're not in enough pain, and you need to  go find a different customer who's in more pain. And if it's a big enough  market, there's got to be someone who's desperate.

Paul Buchheit：所以，我觉得很多企业的事情都很危险，那就是你最终没有真正解决一个紧迫的问题，因为当你和人们交谈时，他们会说：“哦，是的，有这个解决方案太好了。”或者别的什么。然后你开始制造这个东西，你花了好几年的时间来制作这个产品，然后你去那里，你会说，“这就是，我们得到了它。”他们说，“我们这个季度真的很忙，实际上我们可能要到明年才能把它列入预算。那么，我们能在九个月后再谈吗，或者什么的？”对吗？这对一家初创公司来说是致命的。所以我的想法是你想找一个有非常紧急问题的人，对吗？所以我喜欢用这样的比喻，假设你的手臂被钉在巨石下面，你有两个选择。一种选择是用牙齿(听不见)你自己的手臂。或者另一个选择是和这个有前途的年轻创业公司签约，对吧？这就是你想要的顾客，是那种绝望的人，对吧。因为他们绝望了，他们愿意忍受一个糟糕的产品，也许，他们愿意花很多时间和你一起工作，对吗？事实上，其中一件事非常有效，就是如果创始人真的能够进入组织并在那里工作，这就是早期Stripe安装的方式，Patrick Collison会出现并将Stripe集成到您的代码中。他就会出现做这件事。所以这是件好事，如果他们不想让你进入他们的系统，或者和他们的人交谈，也许他们的痛苦还不够，你需要去找另一个更痛苦的客户。如果这是一个足够大的市场，一定会有人绝望。

Geoff Ralston: Back there.
Speaker 5: Do you believe in using personas to represent your customers?

Geoff Ralston: 后面。演讲者5：你相信用人物角色来代表你的客户吗？

Geoff Ralston: Do you believe in using personas to represent your customers? Do I have that right?
Speaker 5: Not really. I don't believe in using people to represent my customers.

Geoff Ralston: 你相信用人物角色来代表你的客户吗？我有这个权利吗？演讲者5：不完全是。我不相信用人来代表我的顾客。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.
Speaker 6: I saw you clearly have a good eye for investments in companies that are going  to reach 100 billion dollars. So have you found any common denominators on the founders  or the products or something they did at some point, stage?

Geoff Ralston: 是的。演讲者6：我清楚地看到你对投资到1000亿美元的公司有很好的眼光。那么，你有没有在创建者、产品或他们在某个阶段所做的事情上找到任何共同的分母？

Geoff Ralston: Sorry, common denominators for the founders of 100 billion dollar companies.

Geoff Ralston: 对不起，1000亿美元公司创始人的共同标准。

Paul Buchheit: So this was actually where the focus frugality, obsession, and love thing came from is  I was actually trying to distill it down into a small enough number of words.  And then I was here try to translate it into emoji, but I failed at  that part. I couldn't figure out what is the emoji for obsession like love, okay,  a heart. But there is, I think this obsessive focus, there's almost an irrationality in  some of these founders. The example that comes up as the most insane version of  it is probably Elon Musk. So he came into the Google, gave a tech talk,  I want to say 2003 or something like that, and it was after he had  started SpaceX, but before they had done the first rocket launch, and someone was, "What  are you going to do if the rocket explodes when you launch it?" He was,  Well, I have enough money for three launches. So I hope one of them succeeds.  He literally ploughed his entire fortune.

保罗·布奇海特：所以，这就是焦点-节俭、执着和爱情-其实是我试图把它提炼成一个足够少的词的地方。然后我在这里试着把它翻译成表情符号，但那部分我失败了。我不知道什么是像爱这样的痴迷的表情符号，好吧，一颗心。但是，我认为，这种痴迷的焦点，在一些创始人身上几乎是不合理的。最疯狂的例子可能是埃隆·马斯克(ElonMusk)。于是他来到谷歌，做了一个技术报告，我想说2003年或者类似的事情，那是在他启动SpaceX之后，但是在他们完成第一次火箭发射之前，有人说，“如果火箭发射时发生爆炸，你会怎么做？”他，嗯，我有足够的钱做三次发射。所以我希望其中一个成功。他把全部财产都花光了。

Geoff Ralston: The first three blew up too, I think.

Geoff Ralston: 我想前三个人也被炸了。

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, the first three did blow up, he managed to scrape together enough money for  a fourth rocket, but if that fourth rocket hadn't gone, there would be no SpaceX  and Elon would be bankrupt, right? That is insane. I would not take all of  my money and plough into some harebrained rocket scheme. Right? That's a level of irrationality  that is, I think wonderful. Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: 是的，前三枚火箭确实爆炸了，他设法为第四枚火箭筹集了足够的资金，但如果第四枚火箭没有消失，就不会有SpaceX和Elon破产，对吧？太疯狂了。我不会把所有的钱都花在轻率的火箭计划上。对吗？这是一种非理性的程度，也就是说，我觉得很棒。嗯

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, you.
Speaker 7: First thank you for the [inaudible] and then I understand that you were saying Google  [inaudible] so much control over the [inaudible] . The question is why do you think  Google has not reached that control of [inaudible] ?

Geoff Ralston: 是的，你。演讲者7：首先谢谢你的[听不见的]，然后我知道你说的是谷歌[听不见的]那么多对[听不到的]的控制。问题是，为什么你认为谷歌没有达到(听不见的)控制？

Geoff Ralston: So I think the question is, how come Google never made it in social networking?

Geoff Ralston: 所以我想问题是，为什么谷歌从来没有在社交网络上成功过？

Paul Buchheit: It just wasn't, I think, really, in the DNA. So we actually had even before  Facebook, do you remember Orkut. We actually could have, at the time-

Paul Buchheit: 我认为这不是DNA里的。所以我们甚至在Facebook之前就有了，你还记得Orkut吗？实际上，当时我们可以-

Geoff Ralston: It's big in Brazil, right?

Geoff Ralston: 它在巴西很大，对吗？

Paul Buchheit: Yeah. Well, it became big in Brazil. But I actually tell you, Orkut actually was  taking off and you can make up a bunch of reasons why maybe it didn't  end up being the social network, but it was exploding, and then it was growing  so fast, it became unresponsive. So just that was why it died off in at  least the United States, is that it was just so slow. But part of the  thing is that within the company, I think, it just didn't resonate with people enough.  It didn't become this crisis where like, "Oh, my God, we have to make this  thing succeed." It was this thing that's over here to the side, right? And so  Google is very much about these really interesting big computer science problems, and stuff like  that, that's what really would get people excited. And this stuff seemed like a distraction.  I mean, like the founders of Twitter, or at least like two of the three  founders of Twitter, were Google employees, right? And they never would have built that at  Google, because if you had built, it'd be, "What is this thing? There's nothing technically  interesting about Twitter." Right? And so I think it just wasn't really in the DNA.  And then when they did try to do it, it wasn't because Larry has a  deep love for social networking or whatever, right? It was because they wanted to be  competitive with Facebook, but by then Facebook was way ahead of them, and had a  much deeper understanding of what makes this stuff go. So if you're behind and not  as good, you're guaranteed to lose.

Paul Buchheit: 是的。嗯，它在巴西变得很大。但是我告诉你，Orkut实际上是起飞了，你可以想出一系列的原因，为什么它最终不是社交网络，但它正在爆炸，然后它增长如此之快，它变得毫无反应。所以这就是为什么它至少在美国消失了，就是因为它太慢了。但部分原因是，在公司内部，我认为，它只是没有与人产生足够的共鸣。它并没有变成这样的危机：“哦，我的天，我们必须让这件事成功。”就是这个东西在那边，对吧？所以Google非常关注这些非常有趣的大型计算机科学问题，而类似的事情，这才是真正让人兴奋的地方。这些东西好像分散了注意力。我的意思是，就像Twitter的创始人，或者至少是Twitter三位创始人中的两位，都是谷歌的员工，对吧？他们绝不会在谷歌建立这样的网站，因为如果你已经建立了，那就是，“这是什么东西？Twitter在技术上没有什么有趣的地方。”对吗？所以我觉得这并不是真正的DNA。然后，当他们尝试去做的时候，并不是因为拉里对社交网络或其他什么都有很深的爱，对吧？这是因为他们想要与Facebook竞争，但那时Facebook已经远远领先于他们，并且对这些东西的发展有了更深刻的理解。所以如果你落后了，没那么好，你肯定会输的。

Geoff Ralston: Not a good outcome. So I think we're going to call it there. Thank you  very much, Paul.


Geoff Ralston: 结果不太好。所以我想我们要把它叫做。非常感谢保罗。
