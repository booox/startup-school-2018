# Carolynn Levy And Panel (Jon Levy， Jason Kwon) -  Startup Legal Mechanics

Geoff Ralston: As always on for Startup school, we're going to have two lectures a day and  this is the second lecture, the second lecture of the week.

Geoff Ralston: 我们将每天举办两次讲座，这是一周中的第二次讲座，这是一周中的第二次讲座。

It's a 10 week  program with just about 20 lectures, give or take. One thing that we neglected to  be clear on is that when you log into your group, if you have this  up at the top, then there is a moderator assigned to your group.

这是一个为期10周的课程，只有大约20节课，不管是教还是学。我们忽略了一件事，那就是当你登录到你的小组时，如果你把它放在最上面，那么就有一个版主分配给你的小组。

And if  you do not, you do not. Okay.

如果你不这样做，你就不会。好的。

Again, if you have questions or problems you  can email startupschool@ycombinator.com. Hopefully, most of you don't need to do that because we do  tend to get a lot of email.

同样，如果你有问题或问题，你可以发电子邮件给StartupSchool@yCombinator.com。希望你们中的大多数人不需要这样做，因为我们确实会收到大量的电子邮件。

There are many of you, but if you  have problems, do let us know.

你们很多人，但如果你们有问题，一定要告诉我们。

I would like to introduce my colleague Carolyn Levy  to my right here who's going to talk about startup mechanics.

我想把我的同事卡罗琳·莱维介绍给我，他将在这里讨论启动机制。

And then with John  Levy and Jason Kwan, they'll answer some questions about getting your startup started, legal issues.  I will point out that these three folks are probably the finest legal minds in  the startup world.

然后和约翰·利维和杰森·关一起，他们会回答一些关于你创业的问题，法律问题。我要指出的是，这三个人可能是创业世界中最优秀的法律头脑。

And I do not exaggerate, they may hate me saying it, but  these folks have seen more, they've worked with more startups in more situations than you  could believe.

我不夸张，他们可能讨厌我这么说，但这些人看到的更多，他们在更多的情况下与更多的创业公司，比你想象的更多。

And some of those situations you wouldn't believe, so they know everything.

有些情况你不相信，所以他们什么都知道。

And  so I do hope you listen carefully and I do hope ... Look, I know  you gave everyone homework to watch videos from from 2014 and 2017 on startup mechanics.  I urge you all to watch those videos if you haven't already as an adjunct  to what Carolyn and John and Jason are about to say because you will find  them useful as you build your company. So Carolyn,
Carolynn Levy: Thank you. Jeff, totally exaggerated. But we have seen a lot of stuff. So like  Jeff just mentioned, back in 2014, Kirstie and I did a startup school lecture on  legal and accounting mechanics, and we were hoping that most of you would have time  to watch that before you came here today.

所以我希望你仔细听我说我也希望.。听着，我知道你给每个人做了家庭作业，让他们去看2014和2017年的创业技工视频。如果你还没有成为卡洛琳、约翰和杰森将要说的话，我建议大家看这些视频，因为你会发现它们在你建立公司的过程中很有用。卡罗琳·莱维：谢谢你。杰夫完全夸张了。但我们看到了很多东西。就像杰夫刚才提到的，在2014年，Kirstie和我做了一次关于法律和会计机械的创业学校讲座，我们希望你们大多数人在今天来到这里之前都有时间观看。

I'm going to blaze through a recap  of that and just a touch on the key takeaways from that lecture. But I  am going to skip the part about investors and fundraising because Kirstie's actually going to  do an entirely separate lecture on that stuff later on in the program. Next, I'm  going to go through some common mistakes and problems that we see founders make.

我要重温一下那次讲座的要点。但是我要跳过关于投资者和筹资的部分，因为Kirstie实际上要在节目的后面做一个完全不同的讲座。接下来，我将介绍一些常见的错误和问题，我们看到创始人所犯的错误和问题。

And  finally, Jason and John are going to come up here.

最后，杰森和约翰将来到这里。

I want to thank all  of you who sent an email questions to us beforehand because we're going to go  through some of those on some of your legal mechanics questions that you guys already  submitted. Okay. So the first thing you have to do when you're starting a startup  is actually form your separate legal entity; this is your company.

我想感谢你们事先给我们发了一封电子邮件问题的人，因为我们将讨论你们已经提交的一些法律机制问题。好的。因此，当你开始创业的时候，你必须做的第一件事就是组建独立的法人实体，这是你的公司。

And the act of  incorporating is just filing a document called a certificate of incorporation, which is really short  and simple for startups.

合并的行为就是提交一份叫做注册证书的文件，这对于初创企业来说是非常简单的。

And you go and you file it with the Department of  corporations in whatever state you choose to incorporate in. Now, we strongly recommend choosing Delaware  because the process in that state is really, really easy, and the service is really  fast and efficient.

然后你去把它提交给公司部门，不管你选择加入哪个州。现在，我们强烈建议选择特拉华州，因为该状态下的流程非常简单，而且服务非常快速和高效。

And that's the primary reason we suggest, but also as a lot  of you probably know most public companies are Delaware companies, so that saves you a  little time if you're going to go public. Some investors actually will require that year  in Delaware before they'll fund you, so that's another good reason to be in Delaware.  Okay. So this has been mentioned a couple times already. We also strongly recommend that  you use an online platform specifically geared to startups to incorporate.

这是我们建议的主要原因，但正如你们中的许多人可能知道的那样，大多数上市公司都是特拉华州的公司，所以如果你要上市的话，这可以节省你一点时间。实际上，有些投资者会在特拉华州要求他们在为你提供资金之前，这也是进入特拉华州的另一个很好的理由。好的。所以这件事已经被提到过几次了。我们还强烈建议您使用专门针对初创企业的在线平台进行合并。

And there's a lot  of these platforms, some are good, some are not so good. Clerky and Stripe Atlas  have already been mentioned and those are the two that we think are great; they're  YC companies. We have extensive experience with Clerky, and I was really happy to hear  that Darby Wong, one of the founders of Clerky is going to do an AMA  because he's great. One of the reasons why we think clerky and Stripe Atlas are  so great is because they don't stop after formation, they also have post incorporation documents.  And some of the not so good platforms stop after formation and they don't do  post incorporation. One of the things that doesn't happen if you don't do post incorporation  is founders don't buy their stock.

有很多这样的平台，有的是好的，有的不是很好。办事员和Stripe Atlas已经被提到，这两个我们认为是伟大的，他们是YC公司。我们在办事员方面有丰富的经验，我很高兴听到文员公司的创始人之一达比·黄(Darby Wong)会去做AMA，因为他很棒。我们认为文秘和条纹地图集如此伟大的原因之一，是因为它们在组建后没有停止，它们也有公司成立后的文件。而一些不太好的平台在形成后就停止了，它们不做公司成立后的工作。如果你不做公司成立后的事情，创始人就不会买他们的股票。

And when we were commuting down here today, Jason  reminded me of a story, a really big company and a really big law firm  and they didn't ...

今天我们在这里通勤的时候，杰森让我想起了一个故事，一家很大的公司和一家很大的律师事务所，他们没有.

The founders never bought their stock and this wasn't discovered until  the series B financing. So if you think this sounds weird, like of course, founders  need to buy socks, but this is a mistake that actually happens. Okay.

创办人从来没有买过他们的股票，直到B系列融资才被发现。所以，如果你认为这听起来很奇怪，比如，创始人需要买袜子，但这是一个实际发生的错误。好的。

Another step  in the incorporation process is forming a board of directors.

公司成立过程中的另一个步骤是组建董事会。

And for early startups, the  members of the board are usually the founders.

对于早期的创业公司来说，董事会的成员通常是创始人。

If you're a solo founder, you can  have a board of one.

如果你是一个单独的创始人，你可以有一个董事会。

If you are two founders, you can have a board  of two.

如果你是两位创始人，你可以有一个由两人组成的董事会。

There's a misconception that board of directors have to have an odd number  of directors, but that is not necessary.

有一种误解认为董事会必须有一个奇数的董事，但这是不必要的。

And then you need to appoint corporate officers.  You need to have a president and or a CEO; you can have both if  you want.

然后你需要任命公司高管。你需要有一位总裁或一位首席执行官；如果你想要的话，你可以两者兼得。

And in Delaware you're required to have a corporate secretary.

在特拉华州，你必须有一个公司秘书。

And another part  of the process is adopting corporate bylaws for startups; bylaws can be extremely generic.

这一过程的另一部分是对初创企业采用公司章程；章程可以是极其通用的。

And  finally, this isn't technically part of the incorporation process, but I encourage you to open  a corporate bank account as soon as possible. Most startups won't have very much cash  to put in that bank account, but it's great to get into the habit of  treating the corporation as a separate entity as early as possible.

最后，这在技术上并不是公司注册过程的一部分，但我鼓励你尽快开设一个公司银行账户。大多数初创企业都不会有太多的现金存入银行账户，但尽早养成将公司视为一个独立实体的习惯是很好的。

And it's critical to  form good habits around the way you treat your company's money. Okay, so post incorporation.  So now we're going to go back to what I just said about issuing founder  stock. You all know that corporations are owned by stockholders and you and your co  founders are going to be the first stockholders. Okay.

而且，重要的是要养成良好的习惯，就像对待公司的钱一样。好吧，在公司成立后。现在我们要回到我刚才所说的发行创建者股票的问题上。你们都知道公司是由股东拥有的，你们和你们的联合创始人将是第一批股东。好的。

If you are a founder team  of two or more, you have to think about how you're going to allocate that  stock. Our belief about the best way to allocate stock among founders is to think  about the challenge of execution.

如果你是一个由两个或两个以上的创始人组成的团队，你必须考虑如何分配这些股票。我们认为，在创始人之间分配股票的最佳方式是思考执行的挑战。

And that's another way of saying the following. Do not  place too much importance on the founder that had the idea for the business because  all of the hard work is in front of the team and all of the  value is going to be created in the future.

这是另一种说法不要把太多的注意力放在为企业提供创意的创始人身上，因为所有的辛勤工作都在团队面前，所有的价值都将在未来创造出来。

If you are all going to  be working hard going forward, which you all are, we think the equity split should  be more or less equal among you.

如果你们都要努力前进，而你们都是这样，我们认为你们之间的股权分配应该是大致相等的。

If you and your co-founders are having a  really hard time coming to a consensus about stock allocation, there may be underlying trust  or commitment issues with the team. So you want to pay close attention to that.  Okay. Founders need to purchase their shares from the company and you buy them using  a stock purchase agreement, you actually have to pay for them. But fortunately, the stock  of a brand new company is very cheap.

如果你和你的联合创始人很难就股票分配达成共识，那么团队之间可能存在根本的信任或承诺问题。所以你要密切关注这个问题。好的。创建者需要从公司购买他们的股份，你用股票购买协议购买，你实际上必须支付。但幸运的是，一家全新公司的股票非常便宜。

The way most founders stock purchase agreements  work is that you give a very, very small amount of cash and then you  contribute to the company any intellectual property that you've created. So that's the total purchase  price for your founder's shares. Founder's shares should be subject to vesting.

大多数创始人股票购买协议的运作方式是，你给了非常、非常少的现金，然后你为公司贡献了你创造的任何知识产权。这就是你创始人股票的总购买价格。创始人的股份应归属。

And this ties  back to the point I just made about all the work being ahead of you.  Vesting means that you don't get full ownership of your stock until a certain period  of time has passed. During the vesting period rather, you can vote all of your  shares. But if you quit your company before the full period of time has passed,  the company will automatically repurchase all of your unvested shares. When shares are subject to  vesting, they're called restricted stock. So your founder stock purchase agreement will be actually a  restricted stock purchase agreement.

这又回到了我刚才所说的所有工作都摆在你们面前的观点。归属意味着在一段时间过去之前，你不能完全拥有你的股票。更确切地说，在归属期内，你可以投票给你所有的股份。但是，如果你在一段时间结束前离开了你的公司，公司将自动回购你所有的未获授权的股份。当股票被归属时，它们被称为限制性股票。所以你的创建者股票购买协议实际上是一个限制性的股票购买协议。

And as I'm sure most of you know, the standard or  typical vesting period is about four years. So I'm not going to get into cap  tables in this lecture because Kirstie is going to explain them in detail in her  lecture about fundraising mechanics. But the basic idea is that every company absolutely needs to  keep a cap table. You need to keep a record of every single share of  stock that your company issues.

我相信你们中的大多数人都知道，标准的或典型的归属期大约是四年。所以我不打算在这堂课中进入帽桌，因为Kirstie将在她关于筹款机制的讲座中详细解释。但基本的想法是，每一家公司都绝对需要保留一个上限表。你需要记录公司发行的每一股票。

And we used to have to do these on these  complicated excel spreadsheets, but fortunately there are now multiple online platforms that will keep track  of stock ownership effortlessly, and we'll make sure that those resources are included on one  of these, on the forum. Okay. Because founders tend to identify so closely with their  startup, it's easy to forget that they actually need to be employees of their company.  So we'll look at that.

我们过去不得不在这些复杂的Excel电子表格上这样做，但幸运的是，现在有多个在线平台可以毫不费力地跟踪股票所有权，我们将确保这些资源包括在其中一个，在论坛上。好的。由于创始人往往与他们的初创企业关系如此密切，所以很容易忘记他们实际上需要成为公司的雇员。所以我们来看看。

It's pretty self evident that most founders can't pay themselves  in the early days of their startup because practically if there's no money, you can't  have payroll. But if there is enough money, it's a really good idea for founders  to pay themselves minimum wage. Strictly speaking, it's against the law not to pay yourselves,  although obviously this isn't a thing that gets enforced. Okay. So employment, whether of founders  or others, does not require an employment agreement. Employment Agreements are not actually appropriate for  startups because employment is at will by default.

很明显，大多数创始人在创业初期无法支付工资，因为实际上，如果没有钱，你就不可能拿到工资。但如果有足够的钱，这是一个真正的好主意，创始人支付自己的最低工资。严格地说，不给自己付钱是违法的，尽管这显然不是一件可以强制执行的事情。好的。因此，无论是创始人还是其他人的就业，都不需要雇佣协议。雇佣协议实际上并不适合初创企业，因为默认情况下就业是随意的。

And the basics of hiring and firing  are governed by law anyway.

而且雇佣和解雇的基本要素无论如何都是受法律管辖的。

In facts, employment agreements can sometimes complicate things because courts  may interpret certain of the language in an employment agreement as changing that default at  will status to a four cause status, which makes it a lot harder to terminate  people. So an employee agreement is only necessary if you're hiring an employee who's going  to have something special, like a severance package, and we really don't see those in  startups. But what is really, really important is that all the founders and in the  future, everyone who works for your company has signed a CIIA or a PIIA.

事实上，雇佣协议有时会使事情复杂化，因为法院可能会将雇佣协议中的某些语言解释为将违约状态改为“四因”状态，这就使得终止当事人变得困难得多。因此，只有当你要雇佣一名有特殊待遇的员工，比如遣散费时，才有必要签订员工协议，而在初创企业中，我们真的看不到这些员工。但真正重要的是，所有的创始人和未来的每一个为贵公司工作的人都签署了CIIA或Piia协议。

And  I'm sure a lot of you have heard of these; it's a confidential or proprietary  information, invention assignment agreement.

我相信你们中的很多人都听说过这些，这是一项机密或专有信息，发明转让协议。

The CIIA protects the company's confidential information and trade secrets and  ensures that all the intellectual property that is created is owned by the company. So  you want everyone in the company signed up to one of these. Very early stage  startups, usually cannot afford to have employees, but the solution is not to convince people  to work for your company for free.

CIIA保护公司的机密信息和商业秘密，并确保所创造的所有知识产权归公司所有。所以你想让公司里的每个人都参与其中一项。非常早期的初创公司，通常不能有员工，但解决办法不是说服人们免费为你的公司工作。

It's one thing for founders to work for  free, but it's significantly riskier for non founders creating work product and other intellectual property  to work for no compensation. So unfortunately, all of you all have to do all  the work until you can afford to hire. Oh, so I'm going to wrap up  this summary and digress from legal mechanics to make a few common sense points.

对创始人来说，免费工作是一回事，但对于非创立者来说，创造工作产品和其他知识产权的风险要大得多。因此，不幸的是，你们所有人都必须做所有的工作，直到你们有能力雇用。哦，所以我要结束这个总结，脱离法律机制，提出一些常识观点。

And  my belief, my personal belief is that ignoring these points can cause you to waste  a lot of time fixing problems later.

我相信，我个人的信念是，忽略这些观点会导致你浪费大量的时间来解决问题。

These are really common mistakes. So ideally, you  will have opened a corporate bank account as part of or right after incorporating the  company and hopefully you have a little bit of money in it. So you should  use that for all of your company expenses.

这些都是常见的错误。因此，理想情况下，你会开设一个公司的银行帐户，作为公司的一部分或权利，并希望你有一点钱在其中。所以你应该用它来支付你所有的公司开支。

If the company bank account has no  money in it and you are paying for all the business expenses with your own  personal savings, the company can reimburse you later when it eventually has money, but you  absolutely need to keep all the receipts and you need to document everything carefully. Corporations  have to pay taxes.

如果公司的银行账户里没有钱，而你用自己的储蓄支付所有的业务费用，公司可以在最后有钱的时候偿还你，但你绝对需要保存所有的收据，你需要把所有的东西都记录下来。公司必须纳税。

If your startup is a Delaware Corporation, there is an annual  tax you have to pay to that state, but if you calculate it correctly, the  tax owed is really minor for startups. Corporations also have to pay ...

如果你的初创企业是特拉华州的公司，你必须每年向该州缴纳一笔税款，但如果你计算正确的话，对初创企业来说，欠下的税真的很小。公司也必须支付.。

They also  have to file a corporate tax return with the IRS. Obviously when your company is  just getting started, you're not going to actually owe the IRS any taxes, but you  still have to file the return.

他们还必须向国税局提交公司税申报表。很明显，当你的公司刚刚起步的时候，你不会真正欠国税局任何税，但是你仍然需要提交报税单。

And if your startup does have employees, even if  it's just the founders getting minimum wage, you need to pay payroll taxes.

如果你的创业公司确实有员工，即使只有创始人拿到最低工资，你也需要缴纳工资税。

And the  best way to do this is to get set up with an online payroll service  of which there are many. Well, this is a personal favorite of mine, so you  need to find a good place to store the company's legal documents, like the certificate  of incorporation, the bylaws, the CIIAs, the founder stock restricted agreements, founder stock purchase agreements.  For example, a shared Dropbox folder is a good idea. Do not store them in  a co-founders email because you do not want one person to control the access to  these very important documents.

而最好的方法是建立一个在线薪资服务，其中有很多。嗯，这是我个人最喜欢的，所以你需要找到一个很好的地方来储存公司的法律文件，比如注册证书，章程，CIIA，创建者股票限制协议，创建者股票购买协议。例如，共享Dropbox文件夹是个好主意。不要将它们存储在联合创始人的电子邮件中，因为您不希望有一个人控制对这些非常重要的文档的访问。

Also, make sure that the legal documents that you are carefully  collecting and storing are actually the signed and dated versions, and triple check to make  sure that every blank signed by every party that needs to sign it. Later when  your company is fundraising and investors are doing due diligence on your company, it just  looks really amateur when you serve up a bunch of formation documents and there's a  bunch of blanks in them.

此外，请确保您正在仔细收集和存储的法律文件实际上是签名和日期版本，并进行三次检查，以确保每个需要签名的方签名的每一个空白。稍后，当你的公司正在募集资金，而投资者正在对你的公司进行尽职调查时，当你提供一堆文件时，你会发现其中有一堆空白，这看起来真的很业余。

All right, so that's the summary of that. Oh, sorry,  one more thing.

好的，这就是总结。哦，对不起，还有一件事。

I just wanted to mention what is acting like a real company,  and my opinion is that acting, if you treat your startup like a board of  directors, a governed, taxpaying founder employee, confidential information holding entity, that that's the way to  act like a real company.

我只想提一下什么是真正的公司，我的观点是，如果你把你的初创公司当作董事会，一个受治理的，纳税的创始人，机密信息持有实体，那就是像一家真正的公司那样行事。

And this is also the only way you're going to  get protection from personal liability, which is the whole point of forming a separate legal  entity anyway. Okay. Now we're going to move on to common mistakes and problems. Okay.  I don't know when to form a corporation.

这也是你获得个人责任保护的唯一途径，这也是组建一个独立的法律实体的全部意义所在。好的。现在，我们将继续讨论常见的错误和问题。好的。我不知道什么时候成立公司。

This isn't actually a problem or mistake,  I just wanted to talk about it here.

这其实不是问题，也不是错误，我只是想在这里谈谈。

And it turns out that a lot  of you emailed us this question. So the right timing on when to pull the  trigger on incorporating is going to be different for every startup. But in general, we  believe in doing it sooner rather than later.

结果发现你们中的很多人给我们发了这个问题。因此，对于每一家初创公司来说，何时扣动合并扳机的正确时机将是不同的。但总的来说，我们相信尽早这样做。

And so my top four reasons about  why you want to do this would be number one, because forming a corporation protects  you and your co-founders from personal liability for your company's actions. Number two, the corporation  is the correct repository for all of the intellectual property that you and your co-founders  are creating. Otherwise, you're all just working on a project, the separate pieces of which  are owned by individuals.

所以我想做这件事的前四条理由是第一位的，因为成立一个公司可以保护你和你的联合创始人不为公司的行为承担个人责任。第二，公司是你和你的联合创始人所创造的所有知识产权的正确储存库。否则，你们都只是在做一个项目，其中的各个部分都是由个人拥有的。

And to me, that's a Hackathon, not a corporation. Number three,  you can't raise ... You all know this, you can't raise real money for your  startup without forming a corporation first because your mom might give you some money for  your startup, but no professional investors is going to wire money to your personal bank  account.

对我来说，那是一场黑客马拉松，而不是一家公司。第三，你不能养.。你们都知道，如果不先组建一家公司，你就不能为你的创业公司筹集真正的资金，因为你妈妈可能会为你的创业提供一些资金，但没有专业投资者会把钱汇到你的个人银行账户。

And you need to have a corporation in order to have payroll.

你需要有一家公司才能拿到工资。

And you  can't enter into contracts or with vendors or consultants or potential customers personally.

你不能与供应商、顾问或潜在客户签订合同。

And if  you try to do these things as an individual, it's super messy.

如果你试图作为一个个体来做这些事情，那就太混乱了。

I formed an  LLC instead of a corporation because I got advice that LLCs are better for taxes.  So for our purposes, this is usually a mistake because even though LLCs are better  for optimizing taxes, the vast majority of angels and VC firms will not invest in  an LLC. So if you plan to fundraise from people other than a small group  of your friends and family, your startup needs to be a corporation.

我成立了一家有限责任公司，而不是一家公司，因为我得到了这样的建议：LLC在税收方面更好。因此，就我们的目的而言，这通常是一个错误，因为尽管LLC更有利于优化税收，但绝大多数天使和风投公司都不会投资于有限责任公司。因此，如果你计划向朋友和家人以外的其他人筹集资金，你的创业公司就必须是一家公司。

The question that  several of you asked in the emails is whether there are other reasons besides fundraising  considerations to form a corporation instead of an LLC. So in other words, if you're  not planning to fundraise for a long time after starting your company, does it make  sense to start out as an LLC and then switch to a corporation later? In  my opinion, the answer is no because I don't believe the tax benefits of an  LLC are compelling enough to outweigh the inconvenience of converting your LLC into a corporation  later.

你们中的一些人在电子邮件中问到的问题是，除了筹资考虑之外，是否还有其他原因来组建一家公司而不是一家有限责任公司。换句话说，如果你在创办公司后很长一段时间没有计划筹集资金，那么从一家有限责任公司开始，然后在以后转到一家公司，这是否有意义呢？在我看来，答案是否定的，因为我不认为有限责任公司的税收优惠有足够的说服力，足以超过日后将你的有限责任公司转换成公司所带来的不便。

And for those of you who watched the 2014 startup school lecture, Kirstie and  I told an anecdote about a company that was an LLC and they had to  convert into a Delaware Corp and it was a $400,000 legal nightmare.

对于那些看2014年创业学校讲座的人来说，Kirstie和我讲述了一件关于一家公司的趣闻，那是一家公司，他们不得不转换成特拉华公司，这是一场价值40万美元的法律噩梦。

It's obviously an  outlier, but we do see this a lot at YC. We see a lot of  LLC to corporate conversions and it's just kind of a headache you don't need. Okay.  I'm thinking about hiring a lawyer to incorporate my company. So this is usually not  a mistake if your startup is really complicated for some reason, or if you've already  formed a non US entity and you now want to come to United States and  raise money.

这显然是一个离群点，但我们在YC确实经常看到这一点。我们看到了很多LLC的公司转换，这只是有点头痛，你不需要。好的。我在考虑雇个律师来组建我的公司。因此，如果你的创业公司由于某种原因而变得非常复杂，或者你已经成立了一个非美国实体，而你现在想来美国筹集资金，这通常不是一个错误。

In these cases, you probably do need to get a lawyer. But I'm  sure all of you know, lawyers are very expensive, so save money and use one  of the good online platforms that we just talked about for incorporation.

在这种情况下，你可能需要找个律师。但我相信大家都知道，律师是非常昂贵的，所以省钱，并使用一个好的在线平台，我们刚才谈到的公司。

Also, realize that  lawyers who are free, like family members doing you a favor, may not be actually  as good as the online platforms because they don't specialize in corporate transactional work. So  your aunt Sally, who does personal injury, may mean well, Clerky and Stripe Atlas will  do a much better job.

另外，要意识到，那些自由的律师，比如家庭成员帮你的忙，可能并不像在线平台那么好，因为他们不擅长公司的交易工作。因此，你的萨利姑妈，谁的人身伤害，可能是好的，文员和条纹阿特拉斯将做一个更好的工作。

I'm starting a startup, but I still have a full  time job.

我正在创业，但我仍然有一份全职工作。

This is actually already come up today. Common problem for founders because it's  a big decision to ditch the security of a salary.

其实今天已经有了。对于创始人来说，这是一个共同的问题，因为放弃薪水的保障是一个重大的决定。

I think some of the  other speakers in this course, we'll talk about sort of the psychology of taking that  plunge. But if you've decided to work on your startup in your spare time, the  primary legal consideration is just keeping everything separate. So in California, for example, if you're  working on your startup on your own time, with your own resources, your current employers  should have no claim on your new business idea. So use a different computer, don't  work on it during business hours, but keep in mind that different states and even  different countries have very different rules about this particular issue.

我想这门课的其他一些演讲者，我们会讨论一下这种冒险的心理。但如果你决定在业余时间开始创业，首要的法律考虑就是把一切都分开。例如，在加州，如果你用自己的时间，用自己的资源，在创业上工作，你现在的雇主不应该对你的新商业理念有任何要求。所以，使用不同的计算机，不要在办公时间使用它，但是要记住，不同的州，甚至不同的国家，在这个特定的问题上有非常不同的规则。

And there are things like  noncompete agreements with your employer that may come into play. So if you're going to  do this, you really should do a little bit of research first or get legal  help. Our founding team has been working on this idea for years, so we don't  need vesting on our founder shares.

还有一些事情，比如与你的雇主签订的竞业禁止协议，可能会发挥作用。所以，如果你要这么做，你真的应该先做一些研究，或者寻求法律帮助。我们的创始团队多年来一直致力于这一想法，因此我们不需要将我们的创建者股份归属。

This is a broken record. We hear this all  the time.

这是个破纪录。我们一直都在听这个。

This is a big mistake.

这是个大错误。

If you don't have vesting, you are setting  your company up for future problems. No investor wants to put money into a company  with founders who may decide the next day that they're burned out, so they take  their shares and they leave. But the more common scenario is that one member of  a founding team decides that he or she is burned out, and so leaves the  company with a giant ownership stake.

如果你没有归属感，你正在为你的公司设置未来的问题。没有一个投资者想把钱投入到一家创始人可能会在第二天决定精疲力竭的公司，于是他们就拿了自己的股份就离开了。但更常见的情况是，一个创始团队的一名成员决定自己已经精疲力竭，因此给公司留下了巨大的股权。

The remaining founders have to do all the work,  but someone who's not doing any work has the same ownership.

剩下的创始人必须做所有的工作，但是没有做任何工作的人拥有同样的所有权。

It is painful to  fix this problem because the price of the company stock may have increased in the  interim and it becomes really expensive for the remaining founders to allocate the share ownership  fairly. How many of you are single founders? I'm just curious. Quite a few of  you. Okay. So, I'm a single founder and I don't need vesting. You may be  thinking.

解决这一问题是痛苦的，因为在此期间，公司股票的价格可能已经上涨，剩下的创始人要公平分配股权就变得非常昂贵。你们中有多少人是单身创始人？我只是好奇。你们很多人。好的。所以，我是一个单一的创始人，我不需要归属。你可能在想。

I think this is also a mistake. Single founders obviously don't have the same  problems that founder teams do, but no vesting is still unattractive to investors for the  same reasons.

我认为这也是一个错误。显然，单身创始人并不像创始人团队那样有同样的问题，但由于同样的原因，归属对投资者仍然没有吸引力。

Also, you will eventually hire employees and probably grant them stock options and  those stock options will have vesting and it just is a lot better when you  lead by example.

另外，你最终会雇佣员工，可能会授予他们股票期权，而这些股票期权也会有归属，只是当你以身作则的时候，情况会好得多。

All right.

好的

Another personal favorite.

另一个个人最爱。

I signed a legal document but I  was too busy to read it, so I have no idea what it is.

我签署了一份法律文件，但我太忙了，看不懂，所以我不知道它是什么。

This  happens a lot.

这种事经常发生。

This is a big mistake. We see founders do this all the  time and I mean we sympathize, right? The legal mechanics of your startup are the  really boring parts of the process. You can get away with not reading every word  of your bylaws for example, but you need to understand every provision in your founder  stock purchase agreement. You actually don't want to have anything happen with your company stock  that you don't know every word of.

这是个大错误。我们看到创始人一直都这么做，我的意思是我们很同情，对吧？你创业的法律机制是这个过程中真正无聊的部分。例如，你可以不读你的章程中的每一个字，但是你需要理解你的创建者股票购买协议中的每一个条款。实际上，你不想让你的公司股票发生任何你不知道的事情。

And this is actually a bigger problem.

这实际上是一个更大的问题。

This  isn't such a huge problem with formation documents, it's a big problem with fundraising documents.  I can't tell you how many founders have told me they won't read a five  page safe. So you want to get into the habit now of reading all of  your company documents; it's daunting, it's legally, it's whatever. Read it any way, understand it.  It's a great habit to get into.

这不是组建文件的大问题，而是筹资文件的大问题。我不知道有多少创始人告诉我他们不会安全地读五页。所以你现在想养成阅读公司所有文件的习惯，这是令人畏惧的，是合法的，是什么的。不管怎么读，都要理解。这是一个很好的习惯。

And then you'll know if it isn't signed.  Okay. My friend offered to work for my startup for free, so I'm going to  pay her with shares. Generally, this is a mistake because people who work for your  company need to be paid money. Obviously compensation packages can include an equity component, but  paying with only stock is not a good idea.

然后你就会知道如果没有签字。好的。我的朋友提议免费为我的创业公司工作，所以我将用股票来支付她的工资。一般来说，这是一个错误，因为你的公司工作的人需要得到报酬。很明显，薪酬方案可以包括股权部分，但仅用股票支付并不是一个好主意。

The exception is if you're a  friend can be hired by your company as a consultant or independent contractor; those are  the same thing.

例外情况是，如果你是朋友，你的公司可以聘请你的顾问或独立承包商，这是一回事。

And it's okay for consultants to be paid for services with just  stock, but you have to first get comfortable that your friend is properly classified as  an independent contractor.

对顾问来说，用股票支付服务是没问题的，但是你必须首先让你的朋友被正确地归类为一个独立的承包商，这是很好的。

And the rules in California about this just changed and got stricter.  Also, you'll want to make sure you paper this relationship with a good consulting agreement  because you really want to make sure that the company owns all of the consultants  work product. You don't want to wing it. Okay.

加州有关这方面的规定刚刚变了，变得更严格了。此外，你也需要确保你用一份好的咨询协议来证明这份关系，因为你真的想确保公司拥有所有的顾问工作产品。你不会想让它飞起来的。好的。

This is a big one. My  co-founder and I don't want to work together anymore. So this is sometimes a small  problem and this is sometimes a fatal problem. Startups die sometimes because of this, and  it happens unfortunately a lot and it can be overwhelmingly acrimonious.

这是个大案子。我和我的联合创始人不想再一起工作了。因此，这有时是一个小问题，有时是一个致命的问题。创业公司有时会因此而死，但不幸的是，这种情况经常发生，而且它的激烈程度可能是压倒性的。

It's kind of like  watching people get a divorce. So the reason to pay careful attention to the points  have already mentioned like paying yourselves, having vesting on your founder's shares, having a CIIA  that clearly demonstrates that the company owns all the IP that's created. Doing these things  can significantly decrease the legal drama around breakups.

就像看着人们离婚一样。因此，我们有理由仔细关注这些问题，比如自己付钱，把你创始人的股份归给你，拥有一个CIIA，这清楚地证明了公司拥有所有创造出来的知识产权。做这些事情可以大大减少围绕分手的法律闹剧。

I don't know what decreases the emotional  drama, but that decreases the legal drama. My company has some employees and I promised  to issue them stock.

我不知道是什么降低了情感剧，但这减少了法律戏剧。我的公司有一些员工，我答应给他们发行股票。

This isn't a problem as long as you take action on  it sooner rather than later.

这不是一个问题，只要你采取行动更早，而不是迟。

And the appropriate action to take is to adopt a  stock incentive plan and to grant stock to these early employees.

采取的适当行动是采取一项股票激励计划，并给予这些早期雇员股票。

A stock plan is  something you probably know, it's like a 15 to 20 page document.

一个股票计划是你可能知道的事情，它就像一个15到20页的文件。

It references a  specific number of shares of your company's common stock that are allocated to the plan.  The company can issue restricted stock or stock options pursuant to the plan, but what  you need to know about stock options is that if you grant stock options, you  have to get something called a [inaudible] evaluation.

它引用分配给计划的公司普通股的特定数量。公司可以根据计划发行限制性股票或股票期权，但你需要了解的是，如果你授予股票期权，你必须得到所谓的[听不见的]评估。

And most startups don't want to do  this until after they've had a fundraising event. So you can issue restricted stock to  employees under this plan and they will also have vesting.

而大多数初创公司在举办募捐活动之前都不想这么做。因此，你可以根据这个计划向员工发行限制性股票，他们也将拥有归属权。

And they come with a  whole host of tax insecurities rules, which is why the plan needs to be 20  plus pages long. But the reason to not wait too long to do this is  because the longer you wait, the more expensive your stock will get.

他们还附带了大量的税收不安全规则，这就是为什么这个计划需要20多页长的原因。但是不要等待太久的原因是因为你等待的时间越长，你的股票就会变得越贵。

And so you  want to grant ... You want to give your employees cheap stock, or as cheap  as you can because expensive stock is not very incentivizing.

所以你想.你想给你的员工便宜的股票，或者尽可能便宜，因为昂贵的股票不是很有激励作用。

I got a cease and  desist letter.

我收到了一封终止信。

Another company says, my company is infringing on its trademark.

另一家公司说，我的公司侵犯了它的商标。

This is a  problem an early stage startup really doesn't need, but we actually see it happen fairly  often. Founders get very attached to names and once this happens, it's really tough to  let go. But your company is probably too young to have created much value in  the name you picked and the expense and distraction of getting into a trademark dispute  with a more established, better funded company can be substantial. So your best course of  action is let it go. Let the name go. Pick a new name and get  back to work. Related to this, a few of you emailed the question about whether  or not it's worth it to register your company's name and get the official trademark.  Generally we consider a trademark registration to be something that can wait.

这是一个早期创业并不需要的问题，但我们实际上看到它经常发生。创始人对名字非常执着，一旦发生这种情况，就很难放手。但你的公司可能还太年轻，不可能在你选择的名字上创造出很大的价值，而与一家更老牌、资金更充足的公司发生商标纠纷的费用和分散精力可能会很大。所以你最好的行动就是放手。让名字消失吧。选一个新名字然后回去工作。与此相关的是，你们中的一些人发电子邮件询问是否值得注册公司名称并获得官方商标。一般来说，我们认为商标注册是可以等待的。

It's a nice  to have, not a need to have in the early days of your startup.

这是一个很好的拥有，而不是需要在你的创业初期。

All  right. Finally, I picked an awesome name for my company, but I have to pay  10K to get the domains.

好吧。最后，我为我的公司取了一个很棒的名字，但我必须支付10K才能得到域名。

This happens a lot. So again, don't fall in love  with the name, that may cause you to make bad decisions no matter how great  that name is.

这种事经常发生。所以，再一次，不要爱上这个名字，这可能会让你做出错误的决定，不管这个名字有多大。

It is a bad decision to waste time getting into a lawsuit  with a company that claims you stole his trademark, and it is usually also a  bad decision to spend a ton of money on a domain. So do your research  on names, like research, don't just research the PTO, research it, and then do whatever  is cheapest and most efficient and move on. Okay, that's it. So now we're going  to have John and Jason come up and we ... Okay, so what we did  is we took ... You guys emailed us a bunch of questions and we pulled  some out, we edited them a little bit for brevity, but we mostly kept them  sort of unfiltered in original style. So, we're going to go through a bunch of  those now.
Jon Levy: Quick announcement.

把时间浪费在一家声称你偷了他的商标的公司的诉讼中是一个错误的决定，而且在域名上花费一大笔钱也是一个错误的决定。所以做你的名字研究，比如研究，不要仅仅研究PTO，研究它，然后做最便宜和最有效的事情，然后继续前进。好了，就这样。所以现在我们要让约翰和杰森上来我们.。好吧，我们做的是.你们给我们发了一堆问题，我们删除了一些问题，我们编辑了一些简短的问题，但我们基本上保持了原版风格的不过滤。所以，我们现在要经历一堆这样的事情。快速宣布。

There's a red mustang outside with the license plate, MEOW GIK, and a  white land rover with a Nevada license plate. We have to move those.

外面有一辆红色野马，车牌号是Meow GIK，还有一辆白色路虎车，上面有内华达州的牌照。我们得把它们移开。

They're in  the way.
Carolynn Levy: M-E-O-W-G-I-K, red Mustang.

他们挡道了。卡罗琳·莱维：M-E-O-W-G-I-K，红色野马。

Anybody need to go move their car? White Land Rover? No one's  getting up to move their car.

有人要搬他们的车吗？白色路虎？没人会站起来移动他们的车。

I'm worried. You guys both have mics? Okay. Jason,  I'm going to ask you the first question when you're ready.
Jason Kwon: Go ahead.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. When does the 30 Day IRS clock for filing an 83(b) election start? And  you might want to start by describing what an 83(b) election form is in case  somebody here does know.
Jason Kwon: Yeah. So an 83(b) election is a tax election. So when you buy stock, if  you don't make an election, what happens is you're taxed on the stock as it  vest. So each vesting period, the amount of stock that that's whatever the value of  the stock is at that time, you incur an income tax for that. But in  83(b) election allows you to be taxed on the difference between the value of the  stock and the price that you pay for the stock on the day that you  actually buy the stock. So it's actually by default in most cases, the best thing  to do when you are a startup founder is to actually make the election so  that because you're going to be paying a very nominal price for your founder stock.  And so there's gonna be no income tax there because you're going to be ...  if you make the election because you're gonna be paying the same amount. So you'll  pay like a dollar for your stock and then basically say that the stock is  worth a dollar and then you make the 83(b) election and then there are no  more taxes that are going to accrue on your vesting as the stock grows and  value. So if you don't do that, which does happen from time to time, you  can be faced with a very large tax liability if your company ends up becoming  very, very valuable as your stock vests.

我很担心。你们俩都有米克？好的。杰森，等你准备好了，我会问你第一个问题。杰森·昆：来吧。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。美国国税局提交83(B)选举的30天时钟何时开始？你可能首先要描述一下83(B)的选举表格是什么，以防这里的人知道。杰森·昆：是的。因此，83(B)次选举就是税收选举。所以当你买股票的时候，如果你不进行选举，你会因为股票的归属而被征税。所以每个转归期，股票的数量，无论股票的价值是多少，你都要为此缴纳所得税。但在83(B)次选举中，你可以根据股票的价值和你在实际购买股票之日支付的股票价格之间的差额对你征税。因此，在大多数情况下，这实际上是默认的，当你是一个初创公司的创始人时，最好的做法就是进行选举，因为你要为你的创始人股票付出非常象征性的代价。所以那里不会有所得税因为你会.如果你当选是因为你要付同样的钱。所以你会为你的股票付一美元，然后基本上说这只股票值一美元，然后你进行83(B)次选举，然后随着股票的增长和价值的增加，就不会有更多的税收会对你的归属产生影响。因此，如果你不这样做，这种情况会时有发生，如果你的公司最终变得非常、非常有价值的话，你就会面临很大的税务负担。

And the time period from when the 83(b)  election, about 30 day period that you have to make the filing, it starts from  the day that you actually buy the stock. So, that is a hard deadline, it  includes calendar days, it's not a business day period, and if you miss it, there's  really not much you can do about it.

从83(B)次选举开始，大约30天的时间，你必须提交申请，从你实际购买股票之日开始。所以，这是一个艰难的最后期限，它包括日历日，这不是一个工作日期间，如果你错过了它，你真的没有什么可以做的事情。

There are some sort of things that  you can do to mitigate the tax liability if you work with tax lawyers, but  if you miss it, it can be pretty bad. So, that's one thing to definitely  remember.
Carolynn Levy: Okay.

如果你和税务律师合作，你可以做一些事情来减轻纳税责任，但如果你错过了，那就很糟糕了。所以，这是一件绝对值得记住的事情。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。

And I will add that this is a good reason to pay really careful  attention to the date on your restricted stock purchase agreement and it should be the  same date that you write the check for the $1 ... Just pay attention to  that. You want that all happening on the same time, so you're not really worried  about like, oh my gosh, what's my actual start date.

我要补充的是，这是一个很好的理由，要仔细注意你的限制性股票购买协议上的日期，而且应该是你为1美元开具支票的同一天。注意这点。你希望这一切都发生在同一时间，所以你不会真的担心，哦，我的天，我的实际开始日期是什么。

And the other thing I'll  say about that is 83(b) election forms need to be saved by the company as  well. So the individual founder is going to save that election form for their own  tax returns in their own files, but the company needs to keep a copy too.  You put that in your shared Dropbox, you make sure it's signed, you make sure  it's date, and you save it in that safe place and the company has it  forever.

我要说的另一件事是，83(B)份选举表格也需要公司保存。因此，创始人个人将把选举表格保存在自己的文件中，供他们自己的纳税申报表使用，但公司也需要保留一份副本。你把它放在你的共享Dropbox里，你确保它是签名的，你确定它是日期，你把它保存在那个安全的地方，公司就永远拥有它。

That's really important.
Jon Levy: It's one of the few things that can't be fixed.

这真的很重要。乔恩·利维：这是少数不能解决的问题之一。

That's also an important-
Carolynn Levy: Well, yeah.

这也是很重要的-卡罗琳·莱维：嗯，是的。

I mean Jason was just saying like there are some ...

我是说杰森只是说好像有一些.。

There are  some fixes sometimes, but they're painful and really expensive.
Jon Levy: And people look at it in diligence.

有时会有一些解决办法，但它们是痛苦的，而且非常昂贵。乔恩·利维：人们勤勉地看待它。

This is actually one of the few things  to remember if-
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, if you remember nothing else from this, file your 83(b) election forms. Okay. So  we also got a lot of questions that touched on a variety of immigration issues.  And here's a sample question we got.

这实际上是少数几件要记住的事情之一-卡罗琳·莱维：是的，如果你不记得这件事的话，那就把你的83(B)张选举表格归档。好的。所以我们也有很多问题涉及到各种各样的移民问题。这是我们得到的一个样本问题。

I'm in Canada, can you help me get  a TN visa so I can work on my startup in the US. John why  don't you take a crack at that.
Jon Levy: This is a difficult ... Jeff said, we know everything, but immigration is not something  that we're experts on.

我在加拿大，你能帮我拿到TN签证吗？这样我就可以在美国创业了。约翰，你为什么不试试呢。乔恩·利维：这很难.杰夫说，我们什么都知道，但移民不是我们的专家。

And this is a situation where you need to speak to  an expert, especially if you have situations where you're going to be ... You need  to be employed, as Carolyn was saying earlier, by your company.

在这种情况下，你需要和专家谈谈，尤其是当你遇到你将要面对的情况时.正如卡洛琳之前所说，你需要受雇于你的公司。

And if you can't  work in the US, you can't be employed because it's illegal, then you're better off  speaking to an expert. Now, immigration is particularly tricky, it's a political issue obviously now.  So the landscape's always changing, but it's also ...

如果你不能在美国工作，你就不能被雇佣，因为这是非法的，那么你最好和专家谈谈。现在，移民问题特别棘手，这显然是一个政治问题。所以景观总是在变化，但也是.

It's more of an art than  a science. So it's always been very difficult for us jumping in, knowing the basics  to talk about immigration. Were really not experts in this area, and you definitely need  to speak to an expert.
Carolynn Levy: Okay, Jason, should I be a C Corp or an S Corp?
Jason Kwon: S Corp. So, if you just file in Delaware, you're kind of C Corp by  default.

与其说这是一门科学，不如说这是一门艺术。因此，对于我们来说，了解移民的基本知识总是很困难的。真的不是这方面的专家，你一定要和专家谈谈。卡罗琳·莱维：好的，杰森，我应该是C公司还是S公司？杰森·权：所以，如果你只是在特拉华州备案，默认情况下你就是C公司。

In order to actually be an S Corp, you have to make an election  on a tax form.

为了真正成为S公司，你必须在纳税表格上进行选举。

The difference between the two of the C Corp or S  Corp is S Corp is pass through taxation since tax transparent. So any income earned  by the corporation is then passed through to its owner, the C Corp, cuts off  the income at the level of the corporation and corporation pays taxes.

C公司和S公司之间的区别是，S公司是通过税收来传递的，因为税收是透明的。因此，公司所赚取的任何收入都会转移给它的所有者C公司，切断公司一级的收入，然后公司支付税款。

And so the  reason why you want to be a C Corp is that's the kind of entity  that investors are used to investing in.

所以你想成为C公司的原因是，这是投资者习惯投资的实体。

And also, when you actually take investment from  outside investors, it will blow the S Corp election most of the time anyway.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, how much equity should we save for our first employees or key hires  during the incorporation of the company?
Jon Levy: It depends on the size of the company and how many people you need to  hire.

而且，如果你真的从外部投资者那里获得投资，它将在大多数情况下打击S公司的选举。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。约翰，在公司成立期间，我们应该为我们的第一批员工或关键员工节省多少股权？乔恩·利维：这取决于公司的规模和你需要雇佣多少人。

I would say the standard is probably 10 to 20 percent people think is  going to be saved for employees, but it's definitely specific to the company. So I  would ...

我想说的是，标准大概是10%到20%的人认为会为员工节省下来，但这绝对是公司特有的。所以我会.。

This is a situation where it's very easy for me to say, “Hey,  you should be very generous with your employees, and you have alignment and make sure  they are from the upside in the company.” It is something I believe very strongly  and especially if you have good employees, you want to keep them, you want them  aligned with your mission. So it's worth thinking about this in a longterm view, having  the longterm view, and setting up everyone for success.
Carolynn Levy: The online platforms, Clerky and Stripe Atlas. Well, I know Clerky for sure has ...  you can actually create a stock option pool at formation if you want to. So  if you've already thought that far ahead and you know you want to have a  plan set up, you can do that at formation.

在这种情况下，我很容易说：“嘿，你应该对你的员工非常慷慨，你要与员工保持一致，并确保他们是从公司的利益出发的。”我坚信这一点，尤其是如果你有优秀的员工，你想留住他们，你希望他们与你的使命保持一致。因此，这是值得思考的长期观点，有长远的观点，并设置每个人的成功。卡罗琳·莱维：在线平台，文员和条形图阿特拉斯。我知道办事员肯定有.。如果你愿意的话，你实际上可以在形成时创建一个股票期权池。所以，如果你已经想了那么远，而且你知道你想要制定一个计划，你可以在队形上做到这一点。

I would say though the vast  majority of companies actually wait and don't adapt to stock option plan until they're a  little farther along. Jason, is it illegal to have unpaid interns?
Jason Kwon: Generally, yes. So you just went over this in the fundamentals. You want to avoid  unpaid employees, and interns are going to be generally considered employees.

我想说的是，尽管绝大多数公司实际上都在等待，直到他们走得更远一点，他们才会适应股票期权计划。杰森，有无报酬的实习生是违法的吗？权杰森：一般来说，是的。所以你刚刚从基本面看了这个。你想避免无薪员工，实习生通常会被认为是雇员。

And then there are  some exceptions you can use or take advantage of for giving people sort of college  credit if they're a college interns or things like that. But that's gonna take some  work on your part to actually learn those rules and you're probably going to need  to talk to a lawyer for those things.

还有一些例外，如果人们是大学实习生或诸如此类的话，你可以利用这些例外来给他们某种程度的大学学分。但要真正了解这些规则，你得花点功夫，而且你可能需要找个律师谈谈这些事情。

And if you want to get the  help of people and so just pay them in the form of equity.

如果你想得到人们的帮助，就以公平的形式支付。

Again, that  was already covered by Carolyn's presentation, they can be contractors, but there are standards for  when somebody is classified as a contractor versus an employee, and those standards got just  recently ...

同样，卡洛琳的陈述已经涵盖了这一点，他们可以是承包商，但当某人被归类为承包商而不是雇员时，有一些标准，而这些标准是最近才得到的.

Are harder to satisfy given some of the California Supreme Court rulings.
Carolynn Levy: We had a YC Company once that have 14 interns; 14 unpaid interns, that was  a big mess. Okay. John, there's a ton of advice out there for how to  properly structure for a for profit startup, what about nonprofits? What's the best legal practices  for starting a nonprofit startup?
Jon Levy: I'm getting all the questions that I can't answer, that seems fair.

考虑到加州最高法院的一些裁决，很难满足。卡罗琳·莱维：我们有一家YC公司，曾经有14名实习生；14名无薪实习生，那真是一团糟。好的。约翰，关于如何为一家盈利的初创企业进行合理的结构建设，有很多建议，那么非营利组织呢？开办非盈利公司的最佳法律实践是什么？乔恩·利维：我得到了所有我无法回答的问题，这似乎是公平的。

The nonprofit are  also completely different; it's a different animal.

非营利组织也完全不同；它是一种不同的动物。

It's different from for profits.

这和利润不同。

I mean, the  government doesn't favor nonprofits because the government likes to get taxes. Nonprofits are tax free.  So if you think about it, the government's going to make it difficult to become  a nonprofit. You have to go through all these steps and fill out forms.

我是说，政府不喜欢非营利组织，因为政府喜欢征税。非营利组织是免税的。所以如果你想一想，政府将很难成为一个非营利组织。你必须通过所有这些步骤并填写表格。

It  takes like nine months.

大概要九个月。

I'm not an expert on it, YC is not an expert  on it, we do donate to nonprofits, we accept nonprofits in our program.

我不是专家，YC不是专家，我们向非营利组织捐款，我们在我们的项目中接受非营利组织。

That said,  it's always been ... You have to have a public good ... Your company has  to be set up for the public good.

尽管如此，它一直是.。你必须有公益事业.。你的公司必须是为了公共利益而设立的。

There are certain disclosures you need to  make. You have to disclose the top five salaries in the nonprofit.

有一些你需要披露的信息。你必须披露非盈利组织的前五名薪水。

And I'm certainly  not an expert in this area, so I don't want to touch on it any  more, but it's a completely different animal.
Carolynn Levy: You're out there soliciting donations from foundations rather than raising from VCs, so it is  a totally different beast. Jason, can I invite a stranger to be a partner?
Jason Kwon: So, that question is probably answered itself. Generally, you want to work with people that  you can trust and know.

我当然不是这个领域的专家，所以我不想再碰它了，但是它是一种完全不同的动物。卡罗琳·莱维：你是在向基金会募捐，而不是向风投公司募集资金，所以这完全是另一回事。杰森，我能邀请一个陌生人做合伙人吗？Kwon：那么，这个问题很可能是自己回答的。一般来说，你想和你可以信任和认识的人一起工作。

And so before you bring on somebody as a partner  or co-founder, you kind of want to understand how well you're going to work together,  whether you can actually build something together, whether you can actually get along. So I  think the answer to that is not if you really want to make sure that  you're going to be successful.
Carolynn Levy: And even if the person who asked this question meant partner like advisor or some  other, not like a co-founder, but they meant something else, I would say don't ever  work with a stranger. Right? And this goes back to what I was saying about  founder breakups.

所以，在你让某人成为合伙人或联合创始人之前，你有点想知道你们合作得有多好，你们是否真的能一起建立一些东西，你们是否真的能相处得很好。所以我认为答案不是如果你真的想确保你会成功。卡罗琳·莱维：即使问这个问题的人指的是合伙人，比如顾问或其他人，而不是共同创始人，但他们意味着其他的事情，我想说的是，永远不要和陌生人一起工作。对吗？这可以追溯到我之前所说的创始人分手。

I mean, that's a recipe for disaster to work with someone you've only  just met because we've seen brothers break up; the founder breakup goes through all levels  of relationships, so you're going to stack the deck against yourself if you have a  stranger involved. John, what are key factors to consider while determining what country should one  register their parent's company in?
Jon Levy: The quick answer is where's the market, where is Your Business, who are you. Most  people set up in the US because they're attacking the US market, which is a  big market.

我的意思是，这是一个灾难的配方，与你刚刚认识的人合作，因为我们见过兄弟分手；创始人的分手经历了各个层次的关系，所以如果你有陌生人，你就会和自己结为对立面。约翰，在决定应该在哪个国家注册母公司时，需要考虑哪些关键因素？乔恩·利维：答案是市场在哪里，你的生意在哪里，你是谁。大多数人在美国设立是因为他们在攻击美国市场，这是一个巨大的市场。

If you're selling something in India, you should be in India most likely.  The problem with this question like the parents subsidiary question to me, I always think  like when I'm talking to startups, keep it simple.

如果你在印度卖东西，你很可能在印度。这个问题对我来说就像父母的附属问题，我总是想，当我和创业公司交谈时，保持简单。

This lecture seems a little dry  and it's the legal mechanics, not the most exciting thing, but it's really pretty simple  if you think about.

这堂课似乎有点枯燥，这是法律机制，不是最令人兴奋的事情，但如果你想一想，它真的很简单。

It's like, hey, form your corporation, be serious, keep your documents,  like don't have one person squirrel it away, buy your stock from the company, never  forgets your 83(b); that's the one thing I want to drill home.

就像，嘿，你的公司，认真的，保存你的文件，就像没有一个人把它藏起来，从公司买你的股票，永远不会忘记你的83(B)，这是我想要钻回家的一件事。

After you buy  your stock, file your 83(b), that's about it.

在你买完你的股票后，把你的83(B)归档，就这样了。

There's not that much to do as  long as you're serious. With parents, subsidiaries, complexity, when I hear that from companies early  on, I just want to run.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, you're going to make it extra hard on yourself with that kind of stuff.  Jason, with the explosion of legal services tech, it's possible I may not need traditional  council until a sophisticated angel or institutional round. When do you advise your companies to  stop using these services and migrate to a traditional law firm? How would you distribute  the work between the two?
Jason Kwon: Yeah.

只要你是认真的，没什么可做的。父母，子公司，复杂，当我从公司早期听到，我只想运行。卡罗琳·莱维：是啊，你要用这种东西给自己加把劲。杰森，随着法律服务技术的迅猛发展，我可能不需要传统的委员会，除非是一个成熟的天使或机构。您什么时候建议您的公司停止使用这些服务并迁移到传统的律师事务所？你将如何在两者之间分配工作？杰森·昆：是的。

There are a lot of good tools out there right now. So you could  use Clerky, you can use Stripe Atlas, you can get pretty far with.

现在有很多很好的工具。所以你可以使用文员，你可以使用条纹地图集，你可以走得很远。

I think  when you get to the point where you're raising significant amounts of capital, you definitely  should get a lawyer because a lot of those agreements are going to be custom  and bespoke or you're just going to be some negotiation. When you're just incorporating and  setting up, those services will take care of it. You could probably go without counsel  or you could certainly get counsel if you want, especially if you want to do  something a little bit more custom. When you get to the point where you're issuing  stock to employees, you probably do want to get somebody involved just because there are  some things that can go wrong if you don't do things perfectly. You also don't  want to be careless about having written promises for stock with various people, so sometimes  outside counsel there can be very helpful in making sure you're not out over your  skis when you were talking about things like that with people.
Carolynn Levy: So John, this question is kind of similar to the one I just asked you,  so it's probably the same answer, but you can reiterate. From a legal perspective, can  I form a startup and then sell it while having a full time job? If  so, what things should I consider?
Jon Levy: I also think Jeff touched on this earlier, but this is kind of asking the  impossible.

我认为当你筹集大量资金的时候，你肯定应该找个律师，因为很多协议都是定制的，或者你只是在谈判。当您只是合并和设置时，这些服务会处理它。你可能没有律师，或者你当然可以得到建议，如果你想，特别是如果你想做一些更多的定制。当你到了向员工发行股票的地步时，你可能真的想让别人参与进来，因为如果你做得不好的话，有些事情可能会出错。你也不想马马虎虎地向不同的人许下股票的书面承诺，所以有时候当你和别人谈论这样的事情时，外面的建议会很有帮助，确保你不会在滑雪板上溜达。卡罗琳·莱维：约翰，这个问题有点像我刚才问你的那个问题，所以答案可能是一样的，但你可以重申一下。从法律的角度来看，我是否可以成立一家创业公司，然后在全职工作的同时卖掉它呢？如果是的话，我应该考虑些什么呢？乔恩·利维：我也认为杰夫之前提到过这个问题，但这是在问不可能的问题。

There's no way or I've never seen any company started part-time on weekends, holidays  become like a giant company. Maybe you can do that on a small scale, but  this is a ... We're asking you to start a company out of thin air  and that is very difficult, to grow a giant ...

我从来没有见过有一家公司在周末兼职创业，假期变成了一家大公司。也许你可以在小范围内这样做，但这是.我们要求你凭空创办一家公司，这是非常困难的，要想成长为一个巨人.

This is an all consuming,  full time thing.

这是一个所有的消耗，全职的事情。

It's not like, oh, I'm going to do this as a hobby.  So I don't want to sound dismissive, but I just think that's practically impossible.

这并不是说，哦，我要把这当成一种爱好。所以我不想听上去不屑一顾，但我只是觉得这几乎是不可能的。

I  wouldn't even think that way, like this isn't a part-time Gig.
Carolynn Levy: Jason, are patents ever worth applying for?
Jason Kwon: So this is sort of like a ... You could talk a very long time  about patents and whether it's useful or worthwhile applying for them.

我甚至不会这么想，就像这不是兼职。卡罗琳·莱维：杰森，专利值得申请吗？所以这有点像.。你可以谈论很长时间的专利，以及它是有用的还是值得申请的。

The short answer is,  so patents are useful for protecting your technology, especially from competitions in copying your technology.  Your technology matters.

简单的回答是，专利对于保护你的技术是有用的，特别是在复制你的技术的竞争中。你的技术很重要。

If you're pursuing a software startup or tech enabled internet company, patents  tend to matter less; there's less protection under patent law for software patents anyway.

如果你追求的是一家软件初创公司或技术支持的互联网公司，那么专利往往就会变得不那么重要；不管怎么说，根据专利法对软件专利的保护都比较少。

And  most of your success is going to be determined not by their protectability of your  property under law, but rather your execution on the software.

你大部分的成功不是取决于法律对你财产的保护，而是你在软件上的执行。

If you're pursuing a life  sciences startup, there duplication is actually easier for competitors to execute on, so patents tend  to be more important.

如果你在寻找一家生命科学初创公司，那么复制实际上对竞争对手来说更容易执行，所以专利往往更重要。

And if you have questions about the specific things that you're  doing technology wise and whether it falls into the weak patent or strong patent protection  bucket, you should definitely consult with a patent expert or a lawyer on that. But  the last part of this is that no company is sort of raised money purely  on the strength of their patent portfolio, it's always gonna come down to how good  is the founding team, can they execute on their vision; the patents are just one  part of the puzzle.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, I'm thinking about setting up an advisory board and wonder if advisors should  have equity?
Jon Levy: In my experience, advisory board are more a non-US thing, like non Silicon Valley thing.  Maybe in Silicon Valley we see advisory boards for life sciences companies. You would see  academics and professors try to legitimize the company as advisors and get a little stock.  But this is not something where, it's not something where you give stock to people  without thought, it's more ...

如果你对你正在做的技术上的具体事情有疑问，不管它是属于弱专利还是强专利保护桶，你一定要咨询专利专家或律师。但最后一部分是，没有一家公司纯粹靠专利组合的力量筹集资金，这总是取决于创建团队有多好，他们能否实现自己的愿景；专利只是谜题的一部分。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。约翰，我在考虑成立一个顾问委员会，想知道顾问是否应该拥有股权？乔恩·利维：根据我的经验，咨询委员会更多的是一个非美国的东西，就像非硅谷的东西。也许在硅谷，我们看到了生命科学公司的顾问委员会。你会看到学者和教授试图将公司合法化为顾问，并得到一些股票。但这不是在什么地方，不是你不想就给别人的东西，而是更.

I think the best quote on advisors somebody said was  like, “Advisors are investors who want stock for free.” And that's Kinda how I think  about it, like people should invest ideally instead of advising for free shares.

我认为一些人对顾问最好的引用是：“顾问是那些想要免费股票的投资者。”这就是我对金达的看法，就像人们应该进行理想的投资，而不是为免费股票提供建议。

I know  this isn't like a one size fits all, some situations like I was saying, it's  appropriate. Maybe a life sciences company and you can have consultants who gets stocked, but  it's mostly a situation I try to avoid.
Carolynn Levy: Jason, what have you seen founders do when they had to cut off and fire  a co-founder who was a personal friend?
Jason Kwon: So has anybody here ever had a roommate who's been a friend? It's Kinda like  that, right? So sometimes it's better to not do certain things with your friend so  that you can stay friends.

我知道这不是一刀切的，有些情况就像我刚才说的，这是合适的。也许是一家生命科学公司，你可以请一些顾问来储备，但这是我尽量避免的情况。卡罗琳·莱维：杰森，你见过创办人在被裁掉后解雇了一位曾经是他私人朋友的联合创始人时，他们做了什么？杰森·昆：那么这里有谁有过一个曾经是朋友的室友吗？是金达那样的，对吧？所以有时候最好不要和你的朋友做某些事情，这样你才能成为朋友。

And so if you have started a company with a  friend of yours and it's not working out, it's often times because you guys have  different ideas about the direction the company should go in, or if somebody is working  just a lot harder than the other person is.

所以，如果你和你的朋友一起创办了一家公司，但没有成功，那往往是因为你们对公司的发展方向有不同的想法，或者如果有人比其他人努力得多的话。

It's usually better to just solve  that problem or basically resolve that problem as soon as possible rather than letting it  be something that you think or hope will work out over time and letting it  fester. Because not only does it hurt the company, it hurts the friendship too. So  it's generally better to kind of get to a quicker resolution.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, you don't want to stall on that.
Jon Levy: No.

通常情况下，最好是尽快解决这个问题，或者基本上解决这个问题，而不是让它成为你认为或希望的事情，随着时间的推移，让它化为灰烬。因为这不仅伤害了公司，也伤害了友谊。因此，通常情况下，更好的解决办法是更快地解决问题。卡罗琳·莱维：是的，你不会想拖延时间的。乔恩·利维：不。

That's something I would add.

这是我要补充的。

The biggest mistake we see is people delaying and  thinking, oh, things are going to work out and this is a friend, and things  are going to change.

我们看到的最大的错误是人们拖延思考，哦，事情会好起来的，这是一个朋友，事情会变的。

It's usually best that you just end the relationship if it's  not working.
Carolynn Levy: And the startup relationship.
Jon Levy: The startup relationships, thank you.
Carolynn Levy: And hopefully preserve the friendship.
Jon Levy: Preserve the friend, exactly.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, what is the best methodology for reviewing potential loopholes in your privacy policies  in terms of service?
Jon Levy: This is an area where if you're going to spend money early on and a  lawyer and you have something that's tricky, that's a sensitive startup topic; it's worth spending  money on a lawyer. But there are excellent services for privacy policies and terms of  service on the internet right now [inaudible] is one, and all the major law firms  also have privacy policy generators. But if there's something specific or [inaudible] I'll send out  on the resources tab.

如果这段关系不起作用，你最好结束这段关系。卡罗琳·莱维：以及创业关系。乔恩·利维：初创公司的关系，谢谢。卡罗琳·莱维：希望能保持友谊。乔恩·利维：保护好朋友，没错。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。约翰，从服务的角度来看，审查你的隐私政策中潜在漏洞的最佳方法是什么？乔恩·利维：这是一个领域，如果你打算早早花钱，找个律师，而你有一些棘手的事情，那是一个敏感的创业话题，花在律师身上是值得的。但是在隐私政策和服务条款方面有着很好的服务，现在(听不到)是其中之一，所有主要的律师事务所都有隐私政策生成器。但是如果有什么特别的或者(听不见的)，我会在“资源”选项卡上发送出去。

It's definitely important, it's required.

这绝对是重要的，这是必需的。

If you're taking somebody's information, you  have to have a privacy policy up on your website or your app in California.  So this is something you need to do, there are good services.

如果你要获取某人的信息，你必须在你的网站或你在加州的应用程序上制定一项隐私政策。所以这是你需要做的，有很好的服务。

In certain circumstances  you're gonna need to hire a lawyer in this situation.
Carolynn Levy: So as many of you probably know, if you are collecting personally identifiable information from  anyone in the EU, you're governed by the GDPR and that's a huge quagmire.

在某些情况下，在这种情况下你需要聘请律师。卡罗琳·莱维：所以你们中的很多人可能都知道，如果你是在从欧盟的任何人那里收集个人身份的信息，你就会被GDPR统治，这是一个巨大的泥潭。

And  so if you fall into that bucket, even though some of these privacy policy generators  are fantastic, they're not going to get ...

所以如果你掉进水桶里，即使这些隐私政策生成器很棒，它们也不会.

They're probably ...

他们可能.。

I mean, unless someone's  really done a great one, they're probably not going to cover all the stuff you  need to know for GDPR. So you would probably want to get a lawyer for  that. Let's see, Jason, should we work 18 hours a day as a co-founder and  founder of our startup? How can we measure and manage our commitment status for our  product?
Jason Kwon: So the advice we give all of our startups is to still exercise, sleep, and  have some semblance of a life in terms of like maintaining some of your relationships  and friendships. So 18 hours a day is not something that we would recommend really,  except for maybe like short sprints where you need to get something out.

我的意思是，除非有人真的做得很好，否则他们可能不会涵盖你需要知道的所有关于GDPR的事情。所以你可能会为此找个律师。让我们想想，杰森，我们是否应该每天工作18个小时，作为我们初创公司的联合创始人和创始人？我们如何衡量和管理我们对产品的承诺状态？詹森·权：所以我们给所有创业公司的建议是，保持锻炼，睡觉，像维持一些人际关系和友谊那样，过着一段好似生活的生活。所以，一天18小时不是我们真正推荐的事情，除非是短跑，在那里你需要得到一些东西。

And just  remember that this is just gonna be a multiyear journey while you're building a company,  so to use a tired cliche, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
Carolynn Levy: You don't want to get sick. Okay. John, should we have a shareholder agreement and  what should be included in a good shareholder agreement?
Jon Levy: Shareholder agreements are really a non US type of document.

请记住，这将是一个多年的旅程，当你建立一家公司，所以使用一个陈词滥调，这是一个马拉松，而不是短跑。卡罗琳·莱维：你不会想生病的。好的。约翰，我们应该有股东协议吗？好的股东协议应该包括什么？乔恩·利维：股东协议实际上是一种非美国性质的文件。

It's a document that describes  in detail what happens when there are departures, severance, founder breakups, or all different types  of situations.

这是一份详细描述在离职、创始人分手或各种不同情况下发生的事情的文档。

And often they can be very detailed.

通常情况下，它们会非常详细。

The ones that I've seen, Canadian  companies have come in with them.

我见过的那些，加拿大公司也和他们一起来了。

It's really a foreign thing, not so much to  US.

这真的是个外国的东西，对我们来说就不是那么重要了。

It goes back to what we were saying or what I was saying earlier,  you want to keep things simple.

这可以追溯到我们刚才说的或者我刚才说的，你想保持简单。

There's no reason to have this giant prenup in  a situation for a startup.

在初创企业的情况下，没有理由要有这么大的婚前协议。

I mean, chances are if things go wrong with a  startup, there are no assets to divide anyway.

我的意思是，如果一家初创公司出了问题，不管怎么说，都没有资产可以分割。

It's not like a marriage, using the  prenup analogy-
Carolynn Levy: Except when you break up.
Jon Levy: Except when you break in a marriage, there are assets hopefully.

这不像婚姻，用婚前协议的比喻-卡罗琳·莱维：除非你分手了。乔恩·利维：除非你在婚姻中破裂，否则你有希望拥有财富。

There's a house, couch,  television, whatever; you need a prenup. Sometimes for startups, these detailed documents that I get  from the Netherlands about what happens when a company breaks up with no assets, seem  just like a waste of time to me.
Carolynn Levy: Overkill.

有房子，沙发，电视什么的；你需要婚前协议。有时候，对于初创公司来说，我从荷兰获得的这些关于一家公司在没有资产的情况下会发生什么的详细文件，对我来说就像是在浪费时间。过度杀戮。

To clarify for some people.

为一些人澄清。

I think that the person who asked this question  was talking about the shareholder agreements that John was talking about, which is among founders.  When you sell preferred stock to investors in like a series A financing, there are  shareholder agreements and they do govern a lot of the things that he just talked  about. But that's between the company and the investors. So that is different, and that  is of course a very US thing. So just to make sure people weren't confused  about that. Okay. Our last question for Jason. Many companies have information about their rounds,  like price per share or amount raised displayed on Pitchbook, Crunchbase, and other sites. Given  that this seems to be due to company charters and filings being publicly available, is  there any way to prevent outsiders from seeing this detail about your company?
Jason Kwon: The technical answer is yeah, there are methods you could use to actually conceal some  of the information to the charters.

我认为提出这个问题的人是在谈论约翰所谈论的股东协议，这是创始人之一。当你把优先股出售给投资者时，就像A系列融资一样，有股东协议，他们确实管理着他刚才谈到的很多事情。但这是公司和投资者之间的事。所以这是不同的，这当然是一个非常美国的事情。所以为了确保人们不会对此感到困惑。好的。杰森的最后一个问题。许多公司都有他们的巡回演出的信息，如每股价格或在Pitchbook、Crunchbase和其他网站上显示的金额。鉴于这似乎是由于公司章程和文件是公开的，有没有办法阻止外人看到你的公司的这些细节？杰森·权：技术上的答案是的，你可以用一些方法把一些信息隐藏到租船上。

The charter are publicly filed documents, and people can  pay $100 or whatever to pull down the charter from Delaware and look at some  of the details of your company. So that's sort of like the literal answer, but  I think the larger answer is just ...

该章程是公开提交的文件，人们可以支付100美元或任何东西，从特拉华州撤除租船，看看你的公司的一些细节。这有点像字面上的答案，但我认为更大的答案是.

It's not something that I would worry  about really because it's sort of way down on the list of priorities in terms  of what you need to sort of think about and plan for.

这并不是我真正担心的事情，因为在你需要思考和计划的问题上，这是一种很低的优先级。

And look, there  are plenty of companies that have this information listed on Pitchbook, they're doing fine and  plenty of others that are not doing fine because it's not because they're on Pitchbook  or not on Pitchbook, it's because of other things. So it's just I wouldn't spend  a whole lot of time thinking about this.
Carolynn Levy: So Jeff and [Adora] , I don't know how we're doing on time and whether  or not you want to do any ...

看，有很多公司在Pitchbook上列出了这些信息，他们做得很好，还有很多公司做得不好，因为这不是因为他们在Pitchbook或者Pitchbook上，而是因为其他的原因。所以我不会花很多时间去想这件事。卡罗琳·莱维：那么杰夫和[阿多拉]，我不知道我们的时间过得如何，你想不想做什么.

Is there a Q&A?
Geoff Ralston: Are there any questions? [inaudible] why don't we take just a few questions and then  we'll call it a day.
Carolynn Levy: Okay.

有问答吗？Geoff Ralston: 有什么问题吗？(听不见)为什么我们不回答几个问题，然后我们就到此为止。卡罗琳·莱维：好的。

Alright. Yes.
Jon Levy: I'm not an expert on nonprofits [inaudible] oh, thank you. She's asking about B Corp,  which is a quasi nonprofit and for profit corporate-
Carolynn Levy: It's a social good.
Jon Levy: ... Social enterprise where part of your mission is for the public good.

好吧。是乔恩·利维：我不是非营利组织的专家，哦，谢谢你。她问的是B公司，它是一个准非营利性的公司-卡罗琳·利维：这是一种社会公益。乔恩·利维：.。社会事业，你的使命的一部分是为了公共利益。

That's not  something I'm an expert in, unfortunately. Many companies have been doing it recently, it's much  more prevalent, I just I'm not really qualified to speak of it.
Carolynn Levy: It changes the fiduciary duties, right. So the whole goal of the ...

不幸的是，这不是我擅长的事情。最近很多公司都在这样做，它更普遍，我只是我没有资格谈论它。卡罗琳·利维：它改变了受托义务，对吧。所以整个目标.。

I mean,  the goal of your average corporation is you make money for the stockholders, right? B  Corp is more like there's a social good, so the fiduciary duties on the part  of the management and the directors are different.

我是说，你一般公司的目标是为股东赚钱，对吧？B公司更像是社会公益，所以管理层和董事的信托责任是不同的。

And like John said, they're gaining in  popularity, so I think we're gonna see a lot more of them.

就像约翰说的，他们越来越受欢迎，所以我想我们会看到更多。

It's not really  YC's things, so I would hesitate to give you any advice about them. But I  know there's actually a couple of good books about them, I have one of them  [inaudible] . But there's a lot of information out there about them.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: You know, if not for YC's, maybe, but-
Jon Levy: It could be fine.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, it could be fine.

这不是YC的东西，所以我会犹豫给你任何关于它们的建议。但我知道实际上有几本关于他们的好书，我有一本[听不见的]。但是有很多关于他们的信息。观众：[听不见]。卡罗琳·莱维：你知道，如果不是YC的话，也许吧，但是-乔恩·利维：可能会没事的。卡罗琳·莱维：是的，可能会没事的。

It's just we haven't done a lot of them so  we don't really have any data about what that looks like longterm.
Geoff Ralston: One point about a B Corp is you can imagine it might not be as  attractive to your typical venture investor. So it depends on what the goals for the  company.

只是我们没有做过很多，所以我们没有任何长期的数据。Geoff Ralston: 关于B公司的一点是，你可以想象它对你典型的风险投资者可能不那么有吸引力。这取决于公司的目标是什么。

If you're looking to create a startup, which is high growth, fast growth, you  won't generally see a B Corp, and most investors probably look at that somewhat askance.
Carolynn Levy: Also, we do have one recently that converted into a B Corp that had been  around for like five or six years. So that's something you could think about too.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: Yeah.

如果你想创建一家高增长、快速增长的初创公司，你通常不会看到BCorp，而且大多数投资者可能会对此略加怀疑。卡罗琳·莱维：另外，我们最近确实有一家公司转变成了一家已经存在了五、六年的B公司。所以这也是你可以考虑的。观众：[听不见]。卡罗琳·莱维：是的。

I mean it can be done, I just don't know the wisdom of it.  Way back there?
Audience: [inaudible] .
Jon Levy: Yes, it is similar.

我的意思是，这是可以做到的，我只是不知道它的智慧。后面的路？观众：[听不见]。乔恩·利维：是的，这是相似的。

The question is, I believe you have a SaaS company in  Australia and you're attacking the US market, but you're also in Australia, you're not sure  where to incorporate again.

问题是，我相信你在澳大利亚有一家SaaS公司，你正在攻击美国市场，但你也在澳大利亚，你不知道该在哪里合并。

Again, the key is where are your customers.

再说一遍，关键是你的客户在哪里。

It sounds like  you're thinking about the US, you not 100 percent sure, and I would just figure  out really where you want to be most from a practical standpoint.

听起来你在想美国，你不能百分之百肯定，我只想从实际的角度来找出你最想去的地方。

Again, like setting  up complex structures is really what the question that we were talking about earlier, and  I have like a little aversion to that.

再一次，建立复杂的结构是我们之前讨论的问题，我对此有点反感。

It could be a situation where it  makes sense to have a parent subsidiary structure for you, but it's a little more  complicated than [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: You can incorporate in the US and then have your Australian company be a sub,  but again, you could just incorporate in the US and just sell into Australia. Like  you could just not ...

在这种情况下，为你建立一个母子结构是有意义的，但它比(听不见的)要复杂一些。卡罗琳·莱维：你可以在美国注册，然后让你的澳大利亚公司成为子公司，但你也可以在美国注册，然后在澳大利亚销售。就好像你不能.。

I mean, if that's your market and that's where you  want to raise money, just incorporate and be a US company.
Jon Levy: We always suggest US companies as it's much easier to fundraise in the US and  much more favorable terms in my opinion. So I always tend to push people to  be in the US.

我的意思是，如果这是你的市场，也是你想筹集资金的地方，那就组建一家美国公司吧。乔恩·利维：我们总是建议美国公司，因为在美国募集资金要容易得多，在我看来，条件也要优惠得多。所以我总是倾向于推动人们去美国。

It's just better for the business long term.
Audience: Just two more questions.
Carolynn Levy: Okay [inaudible] got this?  I have a question about [inaudible]  Okay. So his question was when you add new co-founders later on, maybe a year  or so later, do you have to restart all the original founders vesting schedule to  match the new? And the answer is no, you do not. So you put ...  you and your original team of co-founders, let's say you put four year vesting on  your founder stock and then a year later you find a fourth co-founder who you  think is great ...

从长远来看，这对企业来说是更好的选择。观众：再问两个问题。卡罗琳·莱维：好的(听不见)明白了吗？我有个关于(听不见的)好的问题。因此，他的问题是，当你在晚些时候加入新的联合创始人，也许一年左右，你是否必须重新启动所有最初的创始人归属时间表，以匹配新的创始人？答案是不，你没有。所以你把.。你和你最初的联合创始人团队，假设你把四年的时间归属于你的创建者股票，一年后你找到了第四个你认为很棒的联合创始人.

And by the way, be a little bit circumspect about throwing  the word co-founder around. Like sometimes that person who comes a year later is just  a key hire and not a founder.

顺便说一句，对“联合创始人”这个词的使用要谨慎一点。就像有时候，一年后来的人只是关键员工，而不是创始人。

There's a lot of emotional attachment to the  word founder in Silicon Valley, we all know why. But not everyone's a co-founder. But  to answer your question, no, you guys will stay on the same vesting schedule.

硅谷的创始人这个词有很多情感上的依恋，我们都知道原因。但不是每个人都是联合创始人。但为了回答你的问题，不，你们将保持相同的归属时间表。

The  new person who came a year later, we'll start four years on the day that  he or she started at your company. Now, the thing that some of you probably  already know is that when your investors come in, they may decide they want to  restart you all.

新来的人一年后，我们将开始四年，从他或她开始在你的公司。现在，你们中的一些人可能已经知道的是，当你的投资者进来时，他们可能会决定重新启动你们所有人。

I mean, unless you had absolutely zero leverage, so not going to  start you back on square one. But sometimes investors look at your schedule and they  say, “Ah, you guys only have about a year left? That's not really enough for  us. Can we put on another year.” So that happens every now and then, and  again, it depends a lot on leverage, but don't be surprised if that happens. Did  that answer your question? Okay.
Audience: One more. One last question. So you talk about having [inaudible] applied outside US, and  part of [inaudible]
Jon Levy: So the question was how do you hire outside of the US when you have  a US entity?
Audience: [inaudible]
Jon Levy: Yeah. So, the short but unsatisfying answer is going to be that it depends on  which country because each country has different sort of rules for who counts as an  employee and who counts as a contractor and what you have to do in order  to actually satisfy those roles.

我的意思是，除非你有绝对零的杠杆，所以不会让你重新回到起点。但有时投资者会看你的日程，他们会说：“啊，你们只剩一年了？”这对我们来说还不够。我们能再过一年吗？“因此，这种情况时有发生，这在很大程度上取决于杠杆，但如果发生这种情况，不要感到惊讶。回答你的问题了吗？好的。观众：再来一次。最后一个问题。因此，你谈到在美国境外申请“听不见”，以及乔恩·利维(JonLevy)的一部分：那么问题是，如果你有一个美国实体，你如何在美国境外招聘？观众：(听不见)乔恩·利维：是的。因此，一个简短但不令人满意的答案是，这取决于哪个国家，因为每个国家都有不同的规则，规定谁是雇员，谁是承包商，你要做什么才能真正满足这些角色。

And then also, when you actually open up a significant  presence in any sort of foreign country, what you often times have to do is  create a local entity and sometimes that can be a subsidiary and sometimes it can  actually be something more simple like a local branch.

然后，当你在任何一个外国建立一个重要的机构时，你经常要做的就是创建一个本地实体，有时它可以是一个附属机构，有时它实际上可以是一些更简单的东西，比如一个地方分支机构。

Again, your menu of options sort  of depends on which country you're going into.

同样，你的选项菜单也取决于你要进入哪个国家。

I don't know, do you have like  a country specifically? Yeah, India. So India, typically what happens is there's a subsidiary that's  created, it's usually owned 99 percent by the American parent, Delaware parent and one percent,  or some other small percentage by one or two local Indian sort of representatives.

我不知道，你特别喜欢一个国家吗？是的，印度。印度，通常的情况是，有一个子公司成立了，它通常由美国父母，特拉华州的父母拥有99%的股份，还有百分之一的股份，或者其他一些小的百分比，由印度的一到两个当地的代表所拥有。

And  then that subsidiary is the one that hires employees in India.
Audience: [inaudible]
Jon Levy: I think if you want to try and avoid that kind of structure ...

然后那家子公司就是在印度雇佣员工的那家公司。观众：(听不见)乔恩·莱维：我想如果你想避免那种结构.

Again,  I'm not an expert on India law, you probably need to talk to somebody who  actually has a license in India to actually advise on the employment issue because just  like in the United States, various countries have stronger or weaker protections for when you  can classify somebody as an employee or not.
Audience: Okay.
Geoff Ralston: Thank you guys very much. So sorry to have to cut off, I know there's  a lot more questions live here. Remember Darby Wong from Clerky is having an AMA  now, tomorrow, but it's open now, you can post questions. So if you have questions,  that is an outlet, and you can always work with your group to ask more  questions. Just one more word on the part-time question, which has come up a few  times and we discussed a little bit at the break.

再说一遍，我不是印度法律的专家，你可能需要找一个在印度有执照的人就业问题提出建议，因为就像在美国一样，不同的国家都有更强或更弱的保护措施，当你可以将某人归类为雇员时。观众：好的。Geoff Ralston: 非常感谢你们。很抱歉打断你，我知道这里还有很多问题。记住，文员的王达比现在有一个AMA，明天，但是现在是开放的，你可以发问。因此，如果你有问题，这是一个出口，你可以始终与你的团队一起工作，以提出更多的问题。在兼职问题上再多说一个字，这个问题已经提过几次了，我们在休息的时候讨论了一下。

The way I look at  that, it is certainly true that some companies are kicked off while people are working  in a full-time job. But those aren't really companies yet, they're just projects, they're just  ideas. Once you really start your company, and all of the great companies have this  feature, you'll be on a full time; you'll be on a more than full-time, you'll  be on at 120 percent. So, thank you all for coming in person and thank  you for watching online. Just a couple reminders.

在我看来，确实有一些公司是在全职工作的时候被解雇的。但他们还不是真正的公司，他们只是项目，他们只是想法。一旦你真正开始你的公司，并且所有伟大的公司都有了这个特性，你就会有一个全职；你将超过全职，你将以120%的速度运行。所以，感谢大家亲自前来，感谢大家在线观看。只是一些提醒。

There will be a conversation with the  founder of Y Combinator, Paul Graham on Friday, as well as the AMA tomorrow with  Darby. Next week we're going to dive into product with the CEO of YC, Michael  Seibel, and David Rusenko from Weebly on building product and product market fit.

周五将与Y Combinator创始人保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)进行交谈，并将于明天与达比(Darby)举行AMA会议。下周，我们将与YC的首席执行官迈克尔·塞贝尔(MichaelSeibel)和来自Weeble的大卫·鲁先科(DavidRusenko)一起深入产品领域，研究产品和产品市场的契合。

There are  also several great videos in the startup library on product that I very much encourage  you guys to take a look at.

还有几个伟大的视频在启动库上的产品，我非常鼓励大家看看。
