# A Conversation with Werner Vogels

Kyle Corbitt: This is a real privilege for me. We are here today with Dr. Werner Vogels. He is the CTO of Amazon, and of course has a lot of really exciting experience with that.

Kyle Corbitt:这是我真正的荣幸。我们今天和Werner Vogels博士在一起。他是亚马逊的首席技术官，当然有很多令人兴奋的经验。

So we're gonna be talking to him today about his experience with Amazon, about his experience with start-ups, and about lots of technical topics as well that will be relevant to many of us.

所以我们今天要和他谈谈他在亚马逊的经历，他在创业方面的经验，还有很多与我们很多人相关的技术话题。

So thank you all, and let's give it up for Dr. Vogels.

所以谢谢大家，让我们为Vogels博士放弃吧。

Werner Vogels: Thank you.

Werner Vogels:谢谢你。

Kyle Corbitt: Okay.

Kyle Corbitt:好的。

So we're going to be talking, of course, about Amazon today, and about your role there. But I'd like to start with a little bit of background. Would you mind telling us about your career before you started at Amazon, and what brought you to that point?

当然，我们今天要讨论的是亚马逊，以及你在那里扮演的角色。但我想从一些背景开始。在你开始亚马逊之前，你能告诉我们你的职业生涯吗？是什么让你到了这个地步？

Werner Vogels: How much time do we have? I was an academic before I joined Amazon. I'd been a research scientist at Cornell for ten years, building very large scale distributed systems. And as in common in America and academia, you'd be motivated to do startups on the side.

Werner Vogels:我们还有多少时间？在加入亚马逊之前，我是一名学者。我在康奈尔做了十年的研究科学家，建立了非常大规模的分布式系统。和美国和学术界的共同点一样，你也会被激励去做一些额外的创业活动。

So we did two startups on the side, one of them that already existed when I joined them.

所以我们做了两家创业公司，其中一家在我加入的时候就已经存在了。

They got sold off and were successful to a company called Stratus. I don't know if anybody remembers that. It was before your time.

他们被卖给了一家叫做Stratus的公司。我不知道有没有人记得。那是在你的时代之前。

And the other company that actually failed. We had both experiences and that was great. Kind of.

而另一家实际上倒闭的公司。我们两次都有经验，这很棒。有点

So before that ... I'm not a typical computer scientist. I wasn't until 28 when I decided to actually to go back to school. I worked in hospitals before that, radiotherapy.

所以在那之前.。我不是典型的计算机科学家。直到28岁，我才决定真正回到学校。在那之前我在医院工作过放射治疗。

The dutch Cancer Research Institute doing radiotherapy on cancer patients. At one moment I realized that I really hated all these people dying around me. I decided to go do something that had no humans involved whatsoever. Computer science seemed like a really good thing to go into.

荷兰癌症研究所对癌症患者进行放射治疗。有一次，我意识到我真的很讨厌那些死在我身边的人。我决定去做一些与人类无关的事。计算机科学似乎是一件很好的事情。

This is mid-80s.

这是80年代中期。

So computer science is nowhere where it is now today. But it turned out I had a-

因此，计算机科学远没有今天这样的情况。但事实证明我有-

Kyle Corbitt: There weren't any humans back then.

Kyle Corbitt:那时没有人类。

Werner Vogels: You put it like that, yeah. It turned out I had a gift for it. I didn't know that up front.

Werner Vogels:你是这样说的，是的。原来我是有天赋的。我之前不知道。

And from there I went into research because those were the kind of things that I really was interested in. Got my PhD, worked in Portugal for a number of years at a research institute and then I was invited to come to Cornell.

从那以后，我开始研究，因为这些是我真正感兴趣的事情。我获得了博士学位，在葡萄牙的一所研究所工作了好几年，然后我被邀请来到康奈尔大学。

And then at one moment ... What I did do around that time also, when I was still at Cornell, was actually either consult for large companies like HP and [inaudible] of this world.

然后有一次.。当我还在康奈尔的时候，我也做了些什么，实际上要么是为惠普这样的大公司提供咨询，要么是为这个世界上的(听不见的)大公司提供咨询。

And also often gave talks.

也经常发表演讲。

And so at one moment, Amazon invited me to come give a talk about some of the material that I was working on.

因此，有一次，亚马逊邀请我来谈一谈我正在研究的一些材料。

And I think, like, really? Really, do I have to go? What is this? This is a book shop.

我觉得，真的吗？真的，我一定要走吗？这是什么？这是一家书店。

You know, web surf and a database, how hard can it be? And one glimpse in that kitchen, however, and I realized that this a massive technology operation. It's not a retailer, it's a technology company, and operating at a scale that I'd never seen before, definitely not at other companies that I'd consulted for.

你知道，上网冲浪和数据库，有多难？然而，在厨房里一瞥，我就意识到这是一项庞大的技术操作。它不是一家零售商，而是一家科技公司，经营规模是我从未见过的，绝对不是我咨询过的其他公司。

The challenges that they were faced with from a distributed systems research perspective were amazing. I didn't need to think very hard when they offered me a job.

从分布式系统研究的角度来看，他们所面临的挑战是惊人的。当他们给我一份工作时，我不需要想得很仔细。

Kyle Corbitt: Wow, that's incredible.

Kyle Corbitt:哇，太不可思议了。

That's interesting. Do you feel like that was a change? Like today the interesting distributed systems problems are huge companies and maybe before it was academia? Or was that just, that's the way your career happened to go?

这很有趣。你觉得那是个改变吗？就像今天一样，有趣的分布式系统问题是大公司，也许在它成为学术界之前？还是说你的职业生涯就是这样的？

Werner Vogels: No, I think that still is the case. I think most distributed researchers have become aware of the kind of scale that these very large companies need to operate at. Or not even these very large companies. If you think about, any successful internet company, or digital only company, needs to operate at a scale that is unparalleled. 2004 when I joined Amazon, many of you, if you're going to be successful will be easily operating at that particular scale that Amazon was at in 2004. But there was no body of work that you could really rely on.

Werner Vogels:不，我认为情况仍然如此。我认为大多数分布式研究人员已经意识到这些大公司需要达到的规模。甚至连这些非常大的公司也没有。如果你想一想，任何成功的互联网公司，或只有数字的公司，都需要以无与伦比的规模运作。2004年，当我加入亚马逊的时候，你们中的许多人，如果你们想要成功的话，将会很容易地按照亚马逊在2004年那样的规模运作。但是没有一堆你可以真正依赖的工作。

There was no infrastructure that you had to rely on.

没有你必须依赖的基础设施。

So a lot of effort went into basically keeping the lights on things that cloud and other technologies now gives you. Amazon had got it in 2004 to a scale purely by being practical.

因此，我们花了很大的精力来保持云和其他技术给你的东西上的灯光。亚马逊(Amazon)在2004年将其规模提升到了一个规模，这完全是因为它的实用性。

And it's not that there was a book or so that you could read how to build a scalable organization or a scalable company, no it didn't.

这并不是说有一本书可以让你读到如何建立一个可伸缩的组织或一个可伸缩的公司，不，它没有。

And so everything, Amazon was sort of in my eyes, five to 10 years ahead of the curve both in terms of the usage of technology, of the development of technology but also at the operational scale.

因此，在我看来，亚马逊在我看来，在技术的使用、技术的发展和运营规模上都领先于这条曲线5到10年。

And especially if you want to be a fast-moving company. It's not like you could like traditional enterprises because they all suffered from innovator's dilemma and a lot of things that are really slow at one moment once it becomes successful. How to build a company that needs to continue to move fast is a whole different story.

尤其是如果你想成为一家快速发展的公司。这并不是说你可以喜欢传统的企业，因为他们都陷入了创新者的困境，一旦成功，很多事情都会变得非常缓慢。如何建立一个需要继续快速发展的公司是一个完全不同的故事。

You may be making business trade-offs. For example, the creation of technical debt or allowing duplication to happen or things like that, that would be out of the question in a traditional enterprise because efficiency is their main goal. At Amazon, moving fast and innovating fast and having a very long pipeline of experiments, that's the most important thing.

你可能在做生意上的权衡。例如，制造技术债务或允许重复或诸如此类的事情在传统企业中是不可能的，因为效率是他们的主要目标。在亚马逊，快速的移动和创新，有一个很长的实验管道，这是最重要的事情。

So you're willing to allow duplication to happen, you allow to create technical debt as long as you know that you have to pay it off.

所以你愿意让重复发生，你允许制造技术债务，只要你知道你必须偿还它。

So there's many trade-offs that Amazon has been willing to make over time that you can't find in a traditional MBA book. Most of these things, Amazon had to develop for themselves. Whether it's technology or whether it's processes, or business processes. It helps, of course, with Jeff Bezos at the helm, you have someone who is a true visionary and truly understands how the next modern world will look like, or should look like.

因此，亚马逊愿意在一本传统的mba书中找到许多你无法在一段时间内做出的权衡。大多数情况下，亚马逊必须自己开发。无论是技术，还是流程，还是业务流程。当然，在杰夫·贝佐斯(JeffBezos)的帮助下，你有一个真正有远见的人，并且真正理解下一个现代世界的样子，或者应该是什么样。

Kyle Corbitt: Thanks.

Kyle Corbitt:谢谢。

So a couple of years after you joined, you were appointed the CTO of Amazon.

所以在你加入公司几年后，你被任命为亚马逊的首席技术官。

Werner Vogels: Six months, actually.

Werner Vogels:实际上是六个月。

Kyle Corbitt: Oh, really?

Kyle Corbitt:哦，真的吗？

Werner Vogels: Someone asked you, do you want to be the CTO? You think, “He's not going to ask next year, is he?” [inaudible] , who is still at the company, by the way, he really wanted to be a developer and they had been looking for a [inaudible] replacement for him.

Werner Vogels:有人问你，你想成为首席技术官吗？你认为，“他明年不会问，是吗？”顺便说一句，他还在公司工作，他真的很想成为一名开发商，他们一直在为他寻找一个(听不见的)替代者。

And as I said earlier, sometimes you have gifts that you don't know about until you start doing them. I think I joined in September and I think in January I became the CTO.

就像我之前说过的，有时候你有一些直到你开始做才知道的礼物。我想我是在九月加入的，我想我在一月份成为了首席技术官。

Kyle Corbitt: Wow.

Kyle Corbitt:哇。

So tell me what that was like at Amazon and then what that role has shifted into as we get 'till today.

那么，告诉我亚马逊的情况，直到今天，这个角色已经转变成什么样子了。

Werner Vogels: One of the things that at Amazon, one of the reasons for hiring me and actually a few of my ... I brought, actually, was it? I brought five of my former students with me when I came there, was really to insert more academic rigor into the way that we wanted to approach scaling. Where Amazon had become really good at scale but the challenge was that we wanted to do orders of magnitude more. In lessons, we go from order of magnitude growth.

沃纳·沃格尔斯：亚马逊的事情之一，雇用我的原因之一，实际上是我的一些.我带来了，实际上，是吗？当我来到这里的时候，我带了5名以前的学生来，这真的是为了在我们想要达到比例的方式中加入更多的学术严谨性。亚马逊在规模上已经变得非常出色，但我们面临的挑战是，我们想要做更多数量级的工作。在课程中，我们从数量级的增长。

You have to revisit almost everything that you do, whether it's your processes, but also your technologies. To really be on a solid footing, to do the next one, or to orders of magnitude of growth that were coming, we needed to insert way more rigor into our thinking.

你必须重新审视你所做的几乎所有事情，不管是你的过程，还是你的技术。要想真正站稳脚跟，去做下一个，或者即将到来的几个数量级的增长，我们需要在我们的思维中注入更多的严谨性。

And that was, for example, around performance. How do you measure? What kind of infrastructure do we need for measurements? If you want to be a truly data-driven company that makes data-driven decisions, you need to first of all have the data, but you also need to have a culture around how do you measure? And how do you interpret those measurements? I mean, the medium latency of let's say, one point two seconds off your web page to your customers doesn't say anything. It just says that 50% of your customers have a worse experience.

这就是，例如，围绕着表演。你怎么测量？我们需要什么样的基础设施来测量？如果你想成为一个真正的数据驱动的公司，做出数据驱动的决策，你首先需要有数据，但你也需要有一种关于你如何衡量的文化？你是怎么解释这些测量的？我的意思是，比如说，在离你的网页一秒钟的时间里，你的客户什么也没说。它只是说你的客户中有50%的人的经历更糟糕。

You need to know how much worse.

你得知道有多糟糕。

And then from an engineering ...

然后从一个工程.。

So, for example, the 99 percentile or the 99.9 percentile is way more important often in those cases.

因此，例如，99百分位数或99.9百分位数通常在这些情况下更为重要。

And then how do you create an engineering discipline that has control over that 99 percentile so that you can actually start pulling it in, if that's what you want to do? And then be able to associate that with business decisions. For example, the common knowledge is that if you improve latencies of your web pages, conversion goes up.

然后，你如何创建一个工程学科，控制这个99百分位数，这样你就可以真正地把它拉进去，如果这是你想要做的事情的话？然后才能把它和商业决策联系起来。例如，大家都知道，如果你改善网页的延迟，转换就会上升。

The question then is, how much are you willing to spend to drive that conversion up? You need to have more capacity, you need to do more engineering. When do you have a diminishing return on the investments that you have to make to get that control.

那么问题是，你愿意花多少钱来推动这一转变？你需要有更多的能力，你需要做更多的工程。你什么时候有一个递减的回报，你必须作出的投资，以获得这一控制权。

So for a whole year we focused really on performance and measurement and things like that, there was a bit of it in progress already when I joined. We did a whole year on focusing on single point of failure. Really, I think in 2004 we were pretty good in terms of reliability.

所以整整一年我们都专注于业绩和衡量，当我加入的时候已经有了一些进展。我们花了整整一年的时间专注于单一的失败点。真的，我认为在2004年，我们的可靠性是相当不错的。

There were rules around, so we had to use [sea] data centers.

周围有规则，所以我们不得不使用[SEA]数据中心。

You had to replicate whatever you did over these sea data centers, you'll be able to lose a data center. Customers should not be impacted.

你必须复制你在这些海洋数据中心所做的一切，你就会失去一个数据中心。客户不应受到影响。

So you could lose two data centers, customer can be impacted in terms of latency but not in functionality. All of those rules were there and I think we were pretty good at it, until at one moment we decided so why don't we pull the plug out of one of these data centers? And see what happens? And the first time that we did this was not like we made it as a surprise. No, we gave everybody a heads up that this is what we're going to do. We're not really pulling the plug. I mean, you pull the network, basically, so data center gets isolated. Turns out all these things that look great on paper, didn't really look that great in practice. Although the first time when you do it, lots of manual processes still, manual data base fail overs, things like that.

因此，您可能会失去两个数据中心，客户可能会受到延迟的影响，而不是在功能上。所有这些规则都在那里，我认为我们很擅长，直到有一刻我们决定，为什么我们不从其中一个数据中心拔掉插头呢？看看会发生什么？我们第一次做这件事并不是让人大吃一惊。不，我们提醒大家这是我们要做的。我们不是真的要拔掉插头。我是说，基本上是你拉了网络，这样数据中心就被孤立了。事实证明，所有这些在纸面上看上去很棒的东西，在实践中看起来并不那么好。虽然当你第一次这么做的时候，很多的手工过程仍然是，手动数据库失败了，诸如此类的事情。

This was all pre-AWS.

这都是预告片。

So a whole year focusing on that. By the time you do the third or the fourth of these, what we call game days, you actually get to a point where these things become really well automated and that you can actually do them without human intervention. One biggest surprise when we did the first time was ...

所以花了整整一年的时间来关注这个问题。到了第三天或第四天，我们称之为“游戏日”，你实际上达到了这样的程度：这些事情变得非常自动化，你可以在不需要人工干预的情况下去做这些事情。我们第一次做的最大的惊喜是.。

And then you bring the other data center back on line.

然后你让另一个数据中心重新上线。

And then suddenly that data center has to sync with your other data centers. Man, that's a nightmare.

然后突然间，那个数据中心不得不与你的其他数据中心同步。伙计，那是个噩梦。

That was a scenario that nobody had thought about. But until you do these things, you don't know them.

这是一个没人想过的情景。但除非你做了这些事，否则你就不知道了。

And especially that scale.

尤其是那个比例。

And then we did a year on efficiency, we did some other things. Mostly the role of the CTO is to drive really big programs and think about what is the technology that we need for the future to be able to be on solid footing as a business? Or in the case of Amazon, what other kinds of unique technologies that we've developed that we maybe be able to turn into a business? Then things change at one moment because in the early 2000s, we put an API on the catalog. That was popular in those days.

然后我们在效率方面做了一年，我们做了一些其他的事情。CTO的主要作用是推动真正的大型项目，并思考我们需要什么样的技术，才能使我们的业务立于坚实的基础上？或者以亚马逊为例，我们开发出了哪些其他类型的独特技术，使我们能够成为一家企业？然后事情发生了变化，因为在21世纪初，我们在目录上放了一个API。那在当时很流行。

You just put an API on something, see what innovation happens.

你只要在一些东西上放一个API，看看创新会发生什么。

And it turns out, lots of great companies were being built.

事实证明，许多伟大的公司正在建设中。

So we'd have access to the catalog, search, shopping cart and I think one more functionality.

所以我们可以访问目录，搜索，购物车，我认为还有一个功能。

Anyway, so lots of new e-commerce companies were being built based on the Amazon catalog.

无论如何，许多新的电子商务公司都是建立在亚马逊目录的基础上的。

And they would do comparison shopping and have wonderful new UIs to enrich the whole site, really great stuff being built. But as soon as one of those companies became successful, they all started to stutter in their execution.

他们会做比较购物，并拥有美妙的新用户，丰富整个网站，真正伟大的东西正在建设。但一旦其中一家公司成功，它们就开始在执行过程中口吃。

They all needed to get investment, not because they needed to operate through the business operations, they all need to start buying hardware.

他们都需要得到投资，而不是因为他们需要通过业务运作，他们都需要开始购买硬件。

And they need to hire IT people. All this investment was in essence, an indirect funding of the American hardware industry. All of these companies had a hard time doing that.

他们需要雇佣IT人员。所有这些投资本质上都是对美国硬件行业的间接资助。所有这些公司都很难做到这一点。

They had a hard time getting the investment, they had a hard time getting the hardware because you might order 50 servers. It's not like driving up to Costco and actually getting them in your shopping cart.

他们很难获得投资，他们很难获得硬件，因为你可能会订购50台服务器。这不像开车去Costco，把它们放在你的购物车里。

And then hire IT people and things like that.

然后雇佣IT人员之类的。

So most of those companies that were initially successful around the Amazon catalog all failed.

因此，大多数最初在亚马逊目录上取得成功的公司都失败了。

And they didn't fail because they didn't have great ideas, they failed because they couldn't get their IT stuff ready or get the money to actually do that.

他们没有失败不是因为他们没有好主意，他们失败是因为他们无法准备好他们的信息技术，或者拿出钱来真正做到这一点。

And I think one of the things that got shifted with AWS and Cloud is that the investment that you get no longer goes in large numbers to hardware companies. It goes into hiring more people that are relevant for your company and actually build your products better.

我认为AWS和Cloud带来的变化之一是，你得到的投资不再大量流向硬件公司。它涉及到雇佣更多与你的公司相关的人，并且更好地构建你的产品。

Then we become ... We started AWS, we can talk more about that later. But when you become a technology provider, your role as a CTO changes. I wrote a blog post once about this. In my eyes, there's sort of four different types of CTO. First of all, ask any large company. Every large company, the role of CTO will be different. But I think there's sort of four large categories. One is in enterprises, they're often the infrastructure manager.

然后我们变成.。我们开始了AWS，以后再谈吧。但是，当你成为一个技术供应商时，你作为首席技术官的角色就会发生变化。我曾经写过一篇关于这个的博文。在我看来，有四种不同类型的CTO。首先，问问任何一家大公司。每一家大公司，CTO的角色都会有所不同。但我认为有四大类。一个是企业，他们通常是基础设施经理。

They report to the CIO, manages large amounts of infrastructure.

他们向CIO报告，管理大量的基础设施。

And then there is the second role I think is that of, what you often see in younger businesses, where the CTO is the technical co-founder, the one with the technical vision. I do think that that role is a dangerous one because there's so many other things that actually fall into that bucket in terms of [inaudible] engineering teams and things like that.

还有第二个角色，我认为是你经常看到的，在年轻的企业，首席技术官是技术的联合创始人，一个有技术远见的人。我确实认为这个角色是危险的，因为在工程团队和类似的事情中，还有很多其他的东西会掉进这个桶里。

The CTOs may not necessarily be good at, but we'll talk about that later.

首席技术官们可能不一定擅长，但我们稍后会讨论这个问题。

Then there is the role of a big thinker.

还有一个大思想家的角色。

That is really where you're driving innovation. If you look at companies like AT&T and Lucent and others, they've all had CTOs or had an office of the CTO that will be really building next generation technologies or experimentation there.

这才是你真正推动创新的地方。如果你看看美国电话电报公司(AT&T)和朗讯(Lucent)等公司，它们都有首席技术官(CTO)或首席技术官办公室(CTO)，它们将真正在那里开发下一代技术或实验。

And then there is the role of the external facing technologist. If you're a technology provider to other companies, there's a role for an executive to actually interact at a deep technical level with your customers to understand how are they using my products? And looking for deep, bigger patterns among your customers. What are the bigger pain points that they still have? Not only with our technology, but just in general.

然后是外部面对技术人员的角色。如果你是其他公司的技术供应商，那么一个高管就可以在技术层面上与你的客户进行深入的互动，以了解他们是如何使用我的产品的？在你的客户中寻找更深更大的模式。他们还有什么更大的痛点？不仅是用我们的技术，而且只是在一般情况下。

You know, I've often jokily said, so we're in the business of pain management, AWS. Yeah, so what kind of pain do customers still have that they have to work on that actually don't contribute to the products that they want to build? That's on one hand helping customers understand things, sort of being a bit of the evangelist for the whole notion of Cloud, which definitely let's say, 10 years ago was much more important than it is now. But then, most importantly, take the feedback from your customers back and start thinking about what new features or products you have to do or what kind of processes we need to change to make sure we serve our customers better. It's a much more customer-focused position than a technology-focused one.

你知道，我经常开玩笑地说，所以我们从事疼痛管理，AWS。是的，那么消费者还有什么痛苦需要去做，而实际上却对他们想要生产的产品没有贡献呢？这一方面帮助客户了解一些事情，有点像一个传道者的整个概念的云，这是肯定地说，10年前比现在重要得多。但是，最重要的是，从你的客户那里得到反馈，开始思考你必须做什么新特性或产品，或者我们需要改变什么样的流程，以确保我们更好地为客户服务。这是一个更多的以客户为中心的立场，而不是一个以技术为中心的立场。

Kyle Corbitt: Great. I'm curious, you were talking earlier about, especially in the early days, there were lots of tasks like the game day that you were talking about to make sure that the infrastructure was up for scale. I'm curious if you've noticed in your time in Amazon as it's grown, and the engineering culture has grown so much, are they any tips or tricks you've seen on how to grow an engineering culture and keep it moving quickly? Keep it effective?

Kyle Corbitt:太棒了。我很好奇，你之前说过，特别是在早期，有很多任务，比如你谈论的游戏日，是为了确保基础设施达到规模。我很好奇，当你在亚马逊的时候，你是否注意到随着亚马逊的成长，工程文化发展得如此之快，这是否是你所见过的关于如何培养一种工程文化并保持其快速发展的任何窍门或窍门呢？保持有效？

Werner Vogels: Well, given that Amazon is in reality my first real job, for a long time I thought that the rest of the world was just like Amazon. It's not.

沃纳·沃格尔(WernerVogels)：嗯，考虑到亚马逊实际上是我的第一份真正的工作，很长一段时间以来，我一直认为世界其他地方就像亚马逊一样。不是的。

There's a very unique culture at Amazon I think that works really well for fast moving companies.

亚马逊有一种非常独特的文化，我认为这种文化对快速发展的公司非常有效。

And at least to build your teams as independent as possible. To remove as much hierarchy and structure from your organization as [inaudible] . Hierarchy, in my eyes, is totally unnatural. I mean, you need to have some form of hierarchy maybe for reporting or things like that or for some management pieces. But if you look at nature, there's a head monkey and all the other monkeys.

至少要建立尽可能独立的团队。从组织中删除与[听不见的]一样多的层次结构和结构。在我看来，等级制度是完全不自然的。我的意思是，你需要某种形式的等级，也许是为了报告或类似的事情，或者是一些管理部门。但如果你看看大自然，就会发现一只头猴和所有其他猴子。

There are no lieutenant monkeys. Yeah? No. I mean, you may have multiple of groups of this, all with their head monkey.

没有猴子中尉。嗯否我的意思是，你可能有好几组这样的人，都和他们的头猴在一起。

And it scales really well. I mean, if you look at ants and all the patterns in nature, if you're able to build a self-organizing organization, which means basically that you hire people that really want to be independent. Not want to be followers. That actually want to own a piece of the product and actually take ownership on that. I think that's extremely important when you're a younger business. Where you don't need followers.

而且它的规模很大。我的意思是，如果你看看蚂蚁和自然界的所有模式，如果你能够建立一个自组织的组织，这意味着你基本上雇佣了真正想要独立的人。不想成为追随者。他们实际上想要拥有产品的一部分，并拥有它的所有权。我认为当你年轻的时候，这是非常重要的。你不需要追随者的地方。

You don't need just coders.

你不需要仅仅是程序员。

You need people that want to have ownership over the piece that you want.

你需要那些想拥有你想要的作品的人。

And I think, look for that.

我想，找找看。

There is something at Amazon that we call a leadership principles.

亚马逊有一种我们称之为领导原则的东西。

There's 14 of them and basically, that's all around culture.

一共有14个，基本上，这就是文化。

And so it's customer obsession, ownership, dive deep, and so there's 14 of them. Check 'em out. If you type them in your favorite search engine, you'll find them and a deep explanation of all of them. But that really drives what the Amazon culture is. When we hire, let's say we bring in someone for an interview, you've probably really figured out whether he or she's a good enough engineer through the phone interviews and things like that.

因此，这是客户的痴迷，所有权，潜水深度，所以有14人。看看他们。如果你在你最喜欢的搜索引擎中输入它们，你会找到它们，并对它们进行深入的解释。但这确实推动了亚马逊文化的发展。当我们雇用的时候，比如说我们邀请一个人参加面试，你很可能已经通过电话面试之类的方式，弄清楚了他(她)是否是一个足够好的工程师。

Your interviews are all about culture. It's really, do you have a real good culture fit? Because there's nothing worse than a bad hire when it comes to the culture kind of environment. Because, that disrupts your small teams tremendously.

你的面试都是关于文化的。真的，你有一个很好的文化适合吗？因为在文化环境方面，没有什么比糟糕的雇用更糟糕的了。因为这极大地扰乱了你的小团队。

So with Amazon, we're a strong believer in very small teams.

因此，在亚马逊，我们是一个非常小的团队的坚定信徒。

So 10 to 12 people. Because with 10 to 12 people, everybody knows of each other what you're doing. I mean, by the way, if you want a scrum, if you want to stand in the corridor in the morning with 25 people, that doesn't work.

所以10到12个人。因为有10到12个人，每个人都知道你在做什么。我的意思是，顺便说一句，如果你想要一个Scrum，如果你想在早上和25个人一起站在走廊里，那是行不通的。

You're really focusing on small teams and making sure that they have strong ownership over the pieces that they need to do. One of the building teams that are independent thinkers, want to have control over their own destiny, I think is important. I think one of the challenges is when you grow with a young business, often, I mean the role of a CTO originally is probably that he does everything that has to do with tech. Basically, you think about technology, but also manage the teams. Now, I think managing teams is a completely different discipline. Now, there's a major difference between what I would call a VP of engineering and the CTO. VP of engineering every morning wakes up thinking “Do I have the absolute best team? Is my team in the best position to deliver what it needs to deliver?” It's a people person.

你真正关注的是小团队，确保他们对他们需要做的事情拥有强大的所有权。一个独立思考的团队，想要掌控自己的命运，我认为这很重要。我认为挑战之一是，当你与一家年轻的企业一起成长时，我的意思是，首席技术官最初的角色很可能是他所做的一切都与科技有关。基本上，你考虑技术，但也管理团队。现在，我认为管理团队是一门完全不同的学科。现在，在我所说的工程副总裁和首席技术官之间有一个很大的区别。工程部副总裁每天早上醒来都会想：“我有绝对最好的团队吗？”我的团队是否处于最有利的位置，能够提供它需要交付的东西？“是一个人。

And really thinking about making sure that your engineer's in the right position to deliver the technology, the products that they need to deliver. CTO thinks about technology. Are we building the right technologies? Do we have the right tools? Do we have all of these kind of things? It's such a very different job in my eyes than that of a VP of engineering. Do you guys know Michael Lopp, I think is he well known as the blogger, writes these pieces. If you're a manager, if you think about managing, think in terms of technology management, he's probably sort of the most well-known moderate writer that really thinks deeply about how do you make teams effective? But he's not a CTO. He's a VP of engineering. I think that really embodies [inaudible] wrote books about it as well. Really check out his stuff. Michael Lopp. Rands in Repose I think is the blog.

并真正考虑确保你的工程师在正确的位置上交付技术，他们需要交付的产品。CTO考虑技术。我们正在建立正确的技术吗？我们有正确的工具吗？我们有这些东西吗？在我看来，这是一份与工程副总裁非常不同的工作。你们认识迈克尔·洛普吗？我想他是著名的博主，写这些文章。如果你是一名经理，如果你考虑管理，从技术管理的角度考虑，他可能是最著名的温和作家，他真的深思如何使团队有效？但他不是首席技术官。他是工程副总裁。我认为这确实体现了(听不见的)写了关于它的书。看看他的东西。迈克尔·洛普。我想这就是博客。

So really check those things out.

所以要认真检查那些东西。

Kyle Corbitt: Great.

Kyle Corbitt:太棒了。

So you mentioned earlier that in the early days of Amazon you had those companies integrating with you and they were failing for the infrastructure reasons. Is that where AWS came from? Or tell me, how did the idea for AWS happen? How did that get popular internally?

所以你之前提到过，在亚马逊的早期，你让那些公司与你集成在一起，他们因为基础设施的原因而失败了。AWS就是从这里来的吗？或者告诉我，AWS的想法是怎么发生的？这怎么会在内部流行呢？

Werner Vogels: So internally, the Amazon [inaudible] .

Werner Vogels:所以在内部，亚马逊[听不见]。

They ran AWS as well, now. Are more or less organized in such independent teams and most of those teams look like startups as well. Or they have complete control over their own destination.

他们现在也跑AWS了。在这样的独立团队中，或多或少是有组织的，而且这些团队中的大多数看起来也像初创企业。或者他们完全控制自己的目的地。

And believe me, the recommendation engine for books is very different than the recommendation engine for shoes.

相信我，书籍的推荐引擎和鞋子的推荐引擎有很大的不同。

They're have a different team, they have different goals, they have their own innovation agenda all developed by the team themselves, by the way.

他们有一个不同的团队，他们有不同的目标，他们有自己的创新议程，所有这些都是由团队自己制定的，顺便说一句。

So we'd gone through a number of architectural changes. End of the 90s, Amazon's goal was to get big fast.

所以我们经历了很多建筑上的改变。90年代末，亚马逊的目标是快速增长。

And they were basically violating all sorts of architectural principles to get to that point.

为了达到这一点，他们基本上违反了各种建筑原则。

And that meant it ended up as some sort of monolith and a massive database infrastructure in the back end that was very brittle and basically couldn't grow anymore from an architectural point of view. But remember that nobody had done this before, so they can't be blamed. It's not like you're violating the textbook.

这意味着它最终变成了某种单体和后端庞大的数据库基础设施，从体系结构的角度来看，它非常脆弱，基本上不能再增长了。但请记住，以前没有人这样做过，所以不能怪他们。你又不是在违反教科书。

There was no textbook.

没有教科书。

So then Amazon moves to what's called a service oriented architecture.

因此，亚马逊转向了所谓的面向服务的体系结构。

That was not a word that existed around that time either.

这个词在当时也不存在。

So carving off pieces of the monolith, bringing together the data that you operated on, putting an API on it, and then have a network infrastructure that you can call these, what we called services.

所以分割出一体机，把你操作的数据拼凑在一起，在上面放一个API，然后有一个网络基础设施，你可以称之为这些，也就是我们所说的服务。

And basically, that took two to three years to get that done. Mostly because there was again, no history around how do you run services? So basically, but what we were doing, we were swinging the pendulum all the way to the other end. In this one with the monolith, the whole set of databases were a shared resource and basically the constraint because shared resources are the thing that make you move slower. What we saw, one of the reasons for the changing architecture was that we saw that the effectiveness of engineers was dropping off. Basically deployments were going slower. New features were getting slower, all these kind of things.

基本上，这花了两到三年的时间才完成。最主要的原因是，没有关于如何运行服务的历史记录？所以基本上，但是我们所做的，就是把钟摆一直摆到另一端。在这个具有Monolith的数据库中，整个数据库是一个共享资源，基本上是一个约束，因为共享资源是使您移动得更慢的东西。我们所看到的，改变架构的原因之一是我们看到工程师的效率正在下降。基本上，部署进展缓慢。新功能变得越来越慢，所有这些东西。

And why? Because the back end databases were managed by a group of DBAs, so database administrators.

为什么？因为后端数据库是由一组DBA管理的，所以数据库管理员。

The DBA cabal.

DBA阴谋集团。

And to make any schema changes, you had to go through them.

要进行任何模式更改，您必须经过它们。

And these guys were responsible for these databases.

这些家伙负责这些数据库。

So they were as conservative as you can imagine because the reliability of the site depended on them. All that means our effectiveness and innovation was really dropping off. Moving to this new architecture, we created all these things that were going to be independent.

所以他们是最保守的，你可以想象，因为网站的可靠性取决于他们。所有这一切都意味着我们的效率和创新真的在下降。转向这个新的架构，我们创造了所有这些东西，这些东西将是独立的。

They would have their own data storage.

他们会有自己的数据存储。

There's no longer a centralized data storage.

不再有集中的数据存储。

There's no longer a centralized data store, there's no longer single [inaudible] centralized resources, things like that.

不再有集中的数据存储，不再有单一的(听不见的)集中资源，诸如此类的东西。

So, oh, great. Except for that we made some mistakes there. Okay, so two, three years later we carved off all these pieces.

所以，哦，太好了。除此之外，我们在那里犯了一些错误。好吧，两，三年后我们把这些碎片都挖出来了。

The monolith is largely gone, all services. Turns out there's a side story. We made a mistake. We had three very large data sets. Customer's items, that's the catalog and orders.

巨石基本上已经消失了，所有的服务。结果是有个附带的故事。我们犯了个错误。我们有三个非常大的数据集。顾客的物品，这是目录和订单。

And we basically had taken all the code that operated on that particular data as being one service. Within two years, that was as big as that monolith was. We had to decompose into much smaller functional building blocks. For example, if you talk about the item master, the customer master service that basically consisted of 10 different smaller services. Each with their own unique scaling and reliability, capability. For example, there would be a login service in there that basically is called on every webpage. But in that same piece of software also sat the address book service.

我们基本上把对特定数据进行操作的所有代码作为一个服务。在两年内，它就和那个巨石一样大。我们不得不分解成小得多的功能积木。例如，如果您讨论项目主服务，即客户主服务，它基本上由10个不同的较小服务组成。每一个都有自己独特的规模和可靠性、能力。例如，其中有一个登录服务，基本上是在每个网页上调用的。但同样的软件也有地址簿服务。

That only is needed when you check out. But that whole thing needed to scale at the scale of the login servers because that was the one that requires more scale.

只有当你退房的时候才需要。但这整件事需要在登录服务器的规模上进行扩展，因为这需要更大的规模。

So decomposing that into different building blocks that each have their unique scaling and reliability and maybe security requirements made that we went to what now is called a microservices architecture. Move forward, all these teams, they're small, they own their piece and then we see the effectiveness of these teams tapering off again. 'Cause what happens is that each of those services now becomes ...

因此，将其分解成不同的构建块，每个块都有其独特的扩展性和可靠性，也许是出于安全方面的需求，所以我们采用了现在称为微服务体系结构的体系结构。向前迈进，所有这些团队，他们都是小的，他们拥有他们的部分，然后我们看到这些团队的有效性再次逐渐减少。因为现在这些服务都变成了.。

And needs to scale.

需要扩大规模。

They all need to work on the same thing.

他们都需要做同样的事情。

They all need to manage load balances, hardware, databases. Each of the teams now is responsible for actually replicating the database of three different data centers.

他们都需要管理负载平衡，硬件，数据库。现在，每个团队都负责实际复制三个不同数据中心的数据库。

So, actually all these teams you see the communication between these teams and the networking infrastructure increasing.

所以，实际上，所有这些团队-你看到这些团队之间的交流和网络基础设施-都在增加。

There's all these new tickets being created, all this work being done. But they're not working on innovation.

所有新的门票都在制作，所有的工作都在做。但他们并没有致力于创新。

They're not working on keeping the experimental pipeline going.

他们并没有努力维持实验管道的正常运转。

There was another red flag, and what I realized is that all these teams are doing the same thing. Because we'd thrown the pendulum to that side, that now you had to manage your own database. Dropping actually databases into a shared services platform, dropping storage, dropping networking in there and for example also making an environment where servers no longer were servers but became virtual and you could actually manage them. I think we were really good in those days in terms of hardware provisioning. As an engineer, you would go to a portal, you would fill in what you need.

还有一个危险信号，我意识到所有这些团队都在做同样的事情。因为我们把钟摆扔到了那边，现在你必须管理你自己的数据库。将实际的数据库放入共享服务平台，删除存储，将网络放在其中，例如，创建一个环境，使服务器不再是服务器，而是变为虚拟的，您可以实际管理它们。我认为当时我们在硬件供应方面做得很好。作为一名工程师，你会进入一个门户，你会填写你需要的东西。

You need 10 more Linux servers of this particular size, and an hour or two later you would have them. If you can imagine at the end of the year, towards Thanksgiving, spikes are four times as high.

您还需要10台这种特殊大小的Linux服务器，一到两个小时后，您就可以拥有它们了。如果你能想象的话，在年底，感恩节的时候，尖峰会高出四倍。

So teams need a lot more hardware. If you then would go talk to them in January and tell them “Why aren't you releasing any capacities?”. “Oh, you know, if there's projects coming up in March.” Then we thought, why don't we just hang onto it? And apparently just an hour to get capacity is not a good enough incentive to release stuff again. We needed to go to mobile first of all where you could take engineers out of the loop.

所以团队需要更多的硬件。如果你在一月份去和他们谈谈，告诉他们“你为什么不释放任何能力？”“哦，你知道，如果三月有项目要进行的话。”然后我们想，为什么我们不坚持下去呢？显然，仅仅一个小时就能获得产能并不是再次发布产品的好动力。我们需要去移动，首先，在那里，你可以带工程师脱离圈套。

And, we could have business rules to decide how much capacity is applied to something. Servers needed to become virtual, they needed to get an API, things like that. We built these things for ourselves internally. One look at these companies who were failing on the outside that required scale looked like ... But we solved this for ourselves.

而且，我们可以有业务规则来决定将多少容量应用于某物。服务器需要变成虚拟的，他们需要一个API，诸如此类的东西。我们在内部为自己建造了这些东西。看看这些在外部失败的公司，这些公司的规模看上去就像.但我们自己解决了这个问题。

Then starting to think to say some of those technologies, or not the technologies themselves but thinking about how we had built them for internal, then rebuild them on the outside.

然后开始考虑其中的一些技术，或者不是技术本身，而是考虑我们是如何为内部构建的，然后从外部重建它们。

The first one we launched was Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service in Spring of 2006. Storage for the internet, is what we called it. Really in the early days thinking that this would be targeted at what I now would call internet scale companies. I don't like to use the word startups because I think there's many other types of businesses that eventually required internet scale.

我们推出的第一个服务是2006年春季推出的AmazonS 3简单存储服务。我们称之为网络存储。真的，在最初的日子里，我认为这将是针对我现在所说的互联网规模的公司。我不喜欢用创业这个词，因为我认为还有很多其他类型的企业最终需要互联网规模。

And that was really where we were pushing for. Storage became the first one, we launched EC2 in the fall of that year. Same kind of mobile and interfaces that we used internally, where suddenly the compute capability became programmable. Within a few months enterprises figured out that this was way too good a deal for them as well, and we know what the story is since then.

而这正是我们所追求的目标。存储成为第一个，我们在那年秋天推出了EC2。与我们内部使用的相同的移动和接口，其中的计算能力突然变成了可编程的。几个月后，企业发现这对他们来说也太好了，从那时起我们就知道这是什么故事了。

Kyle Corbitt: I am curious, I mean at the time as you were developing this, before it was released, did Amazon have a sense ... I mean, it's a dominant product now in the world. It's changed the way developers work at small and large companies. Did you really have that belief coming in, this is going to change the landscape? Or was it just sort of like an iterate every year more people were using it and it just slowly grew into what it is today?

Kyle Corbitt:我很好奇，我的意思是，当你开发这个软件的时候，在它发布之前，亚马逊是否有一种感觉.我是说，它现在是世界上的主导产品。它改变了小公司和大公司开发人员的工作方式。你真的有这样的信念，这会改变景观吗？还是每年都会有更多的人使用它，然后慢慢发展成今天的样子呢？

Werner Vogels: I think one of the things that we were, I won't say caught off guard by, is that how fast it grew.

Werner Vogels:我认为，我不想说，我们当时的情况之一就是它增长得多快。

That's definitely. Did we know it was going to be really big? Yes, that was the bet that we were making. On Amazon, there's two types of innovation that happens. One of them is that each team by themselves is in charge of the innovation road map for the coming year. Teams do that for themselves. If they set the recommendation engine for shoes, who has as a metric to reduce the number of returns. Can you recommend? Now, if this Valentinos nine fitted you really well, if you want to buy this Jimmy Choos, maybe do an eight and a half.

那绝对是。我们知道它会很大吗？是的，这就是我们所做的赌注。在亚马逊，有两种类型的创新正在发生。其中之一是，每个团队自己负责未来一年的创新路线图。团队是为自己而做的。如果他们为鞋子设置了推荐引擎，那么谁可以作为一个指标来减少退货的数量。你能推荐一下吗？现在，如果这个瓦伦蒂诺九适合你真的很好，如果你想买这个吉米朱斯，也许做一个八个半。

This seems silly but doing returns is a tax, it's a customer unfriendly kind of thing.

这听起来很傻，但做报税是一种税，是一种对顾客不友好的东西。

So the more you can do that.

所以你越能做到。

Those guys are in charge of building a road map for the coming year. How to get new data sources, how to maybe engage with your customers differently.

这些人负责制定来年的路线图。如何获得新的数据源，如何以不同的方式与客户打交道。

That's something they make themselves. There's no top down thing, and thou shall do this.

这是他们自己制造的东西。没有自上而下的东西，你应该这样做。

So that's one level of innovation.

这是一种创新。

The other level is the one that requires significant capital investment.

另一个层次是需要大量资本投资的水平。

And that was clearly something that AWS falls into, that particular category.

很明显，AWS属于特定类别。

Things like the Kindle, Amazon Prime, all those are all things that to do that we needed to do significant capital investment.

像Kindle，AmazonPrime，所有这些都是我们需要做的事情，我们需要做大量的资本投资。

Then Amazon left a rule that if you do that, if it's going to be successful, it needs to be successful in a way that has significant impact on the Amazon balance sheet. It's not that we're interested in another, let's say, it sounds [inaudible] , but another 50 million dollar opportunity now where if you make this capital investment you need to look for really big opportunities. We knew that if AWS was going to be successful, it was going to be massively successful. In a way that we'd never seen before. We knew that we had to develop lots of new processes and technologies and techniques and whatever for all of this if it was going to be successful. Now, I remember when we were developing S3 we wrote a number on the board, that we thought “Oh, within six months we're probably ... Let's build this for this number of objects in the storage engine.” And then just for the heck of it, we put two orders of magnitude behind it.

然后亚马逊留下了一条规则，如果你这样做，如果它要成功的话，它必须以对亚马逊资产负债表有重大影响的方式取得成功。这并不是说我们对另一种投资感兴趣，比方说，这听起来(听不见)，而是另一次5000万美元的机会，如果你在这里进行资本投资，你需要寻找真正的巨大机会。我们知道，如果AWS要成功，它就会非常成功。以一种我们从未见过的方式。我们知道，如果它要成功的话，我们必须开发许多新的流程、技术和技术。现在，我记得当我们开发S3的时候，我们在黑板上写了一个数字，我们想“哦，在六个月内我们可能.让我们为存储引擎中的这么多对象构建这个程序。“然后，为了它的本质，我们在它后面放了两个数量级。

Things like, okay. Blew through that in the first three months. Oh. Now suddenly it turns out that some decisions we made early on from a technology point of view were really smart. We knew that with every order of magnitude of growth, you probably need to revisit your architecture that you have.

比如，好吧。在最初的三个月里经历了这一切。噢现在突然间，从技术的角度来看，我们早期做出的一些决定是非常明智的。我们知道，随着每一个数量级的增长，你可能需要重新审视你的架构。

You need to build software that needs to be able to evolve over time. For example, take a storage engine. If you go to next release internally of your software, you can't just copy the massive amount of petabytes that you have on the other storage discs to do this, no.

您需要构建能够随时间发展的软件。例如，以存储引擎为例。如果你进入下一个版本，你的软件，你不能只是复制大量的千兆字节，你有在其他存储光盘上这样做，不。

You have to live with multiple architectures at the same time, multiple versions, all these kind of things. Fortunately, with all the lessons from Amazon.com, we'd actually taken the right steps there. But there's been some challenges over time in that sense. But I think also, just like with any other company, there's not only the tech that you have to scale. I think early days at AWS I believe we said something like “We don't need any sales people.

你必须同时拥有多个体系结构，多个版本，所有这些东西。幸运的是，有了Amazon.com的所有经验教训，我们实际上已经在那里采取了正确的步骤。但在这个意义上，随着时间的推移，已经出现了一些挑战。但我也认为，就像其他公司一样，你不仅需要扩大科技规模。我想在AWS的早期，我相信我们说过“我们不需要任何销售人员。”

This stuff will sell itself.

这些东西会自己卖出去的。

This is all self service.” Well, turns out, that's not the case. It turns out you need solution architecture, you need technical account managers, you need customer support.

这都是自助服务。“但事实并非如此。事实证明，你需要解决方案架构，你需要技术客户经理，你需要客户支持。

You need all these kind of things to build around your product that have nothing to do with the tech itself. But, you cannot become a successful company without that.

你需要围绕你的产品建立所有这些与技术本身无关的东西。但是，没有这一点，你就不可能成为一家成功的公司。

Kyle Corbitt: I was looking just right before this interview actually, and I was looking at the AWS directory page.

Kyle Corbitt:就在这次采访之前，我在看，我看的是AWS目录页面。

And there's I don't know, I think it was like 130 services and probably that number will change, by the time we finish this conversation. I'm curious, how do you as an organization determine ... How do you decide to build something new? Is it a top down process? Is it just an individual team? What does that look like, to launch something new?

我不知道，我认为这是130项服务，当我们完成这段对话的时候，这个数字可能会改变。我很好奇，作为一个组织，你是怎么决定.你是如何决定建造新的东西的？这是一个自上而下的过程吗？这只是一个单独的团队吗？这是什么样子的，推出新的东西？

Werner Vogels: It works both ways. We expect all of our teams as they are now to be in very close contact with our customers. About 95% of features and services that we deliver are in response to direct requests from our customers.

Werner Vogels:这是双向的。我们期待我们所有的团队，因为他们现在是非常密切的联系，我们的客户。我们提供的95%的功能和服务都是针对我们客户的直接要求而提供的。

That's a massive influx, of course the early earliest services that we built, you could almost think about what they should be. I mean, what is the basic IT infrastructure, storage, compute, databases, network, security. I mean, you didn't need customers to actually tell you that. We knew that those were the basic pieces that we needed to build. But pretty quickly, customers came with all sorts of other requests. I mean, if I look at the kind of things that AWS was really good at, at a fundamental level, it is scale, performance, security, reliability, and managing cost.

这是一个大规模的涌入，当然，早期我们建立的服务，你几乎可以考虑它们应该是什么。我的意思是，什么是基本的IT基础设施，存储，计算，数据库，网络，安全。我是说，你不需要顾客来告诉你。我们知道，这些是我们需要建立的基本部分。但很快，顾客们就带着各种各样的其他请求来了。我的意思是，如果我看看AWS真正擅长的事情，从根本上讲，它就是规模、性能、安全性、可靠性和管理成本。

Those are not products on the outside but those are core capabilities that come back in each and every one of these services. Customers then came to us and said “Well, you know, can't you run analytics for us?” This is the early days, so everything about analytics, around IUT, about mobile development, about these days blockchain, all these other technologies that customers actually want to use, but do not want to manage themselves.

这些不是外部的产品，而是每一种服务中的核心功能。顾客们走过来对我们说：“好吧，你知道，你不能为我们做些分析吗？”这是早期，所以所有关于分析，围绕IUT，关于移动开发，现在关于区块链，所有其他的技术，客户实际上想使用，但不想管理自己。

And essentially helping them putting up the right features or tools is important.

从本质上讲，帮助他们提供正确的特性或工具是很重要的。

And we also had a very strong culture around when we launch new products, new services, we'll launch them with a minimal feature set.

当我们推出新产品、新服务时，我们也有一种非常强大的文化，我们将以最小的功能集推出它们。

You could call it an MVP. But this is technology that other people need to build their business on.

你可以称之为MVP。但这是其他人需要建立他们的业务的技术。

You can't actually launch things that are flakey, it needs to be rock solid.

你不可能真的发射出一些不稳定的东西，它必须是坚固的。

So we launch things rock solid but with minimum feature sets and then work with your customers on what should the other features be. Now, in general we don't have an inkling what the other features are going to be. When we launched DynamoDB For example, we really knew customers wanted secondary [NDCs] . We didn't launch with them but that was obvious that that was what they wanted. We mostly launch with minimum feature sets because these are sometimes services nobody else has used before, nobody built. We need to observe your customers, how they're gonna use your product. Because you don't know up front. Actually, they'll probably use it in every possible way except for the one that you intended it to.

因此，我们推出的东西坚如磐石，但功能集最少，然后与你的客户合作，其他的功能应该是什么。现在，一般来说，我们不知道其他功能将是什么。例如，当我们推出DynamoDB时，我们确实知道客户需要二级(NDC)。我们没有和他们一起出发，但这显然是他们想要的。我们主要是以最小的功能集启动，因为这些服务有时是其他人从未使用过的服务，没有人构建过。我们需要观察你的客户，他们将如何使用你的产品。因为你之前不知道。实际上，他们可能会以每一种可能的方式使用它，除了你想要它的那一种。

That is good because if it didn't launch with everything and the kitchen sink, then you can focus on how your customers are using your product, and then slowly start to iterate and add in new features and services to it in the way that their new modern way of development is working. When we launched Lambda, which is our server-less environment, so basically you just write code, you dump it in S3, and you don't need to think about servers and anything else.

这是好的，因为如果它没有推出所有的东西和厨房水槽，那么你可以专注于你的客户是如何使用你的产品，然后慢慢开始迭代和添加新的功能和服务的方式，他们的新的现代发展方式正在运作。当我们启动Lambda时，这是我们没有服务器的环境，所以基本上您只需编写代码，就可以将其转储到S3中，而不需要考虑服务器和其他任何事情。

You don't need to think about idle time.

你不需要考虑空闲时间。

You only have to pay for what you use, things like that. Great environment. Nobody done that before.

你只需要为你所用的东西付钱，诸如此类的事情。很好的环境。以前没人这么做过。

So how is development going to change? What's the other support structures around it? Originally, maybe we launched it much more as an event driven environment.

那么，发展将如何改变呢？它周围的其他支撑结构是什么？最初，也许我们推出它更多的是作为一个事件驱动的环境。

So, a new file arrives in S3, it triggers some code. A new message arrives, it triggers some code, API gateway.

因此，一个新的文件到达S3，它会触发一些代码。一条新消息到达，它触发一些代码，API网关。

Things like that. But it turns out, some of the companies that actually immediately jumped on board with server-less were some of the largest enterprises. Why? Because you don't need to manage anything and you don't need to pay if no execution happens. I mean, if you run a whole batch of SE2 instances, whether you use them or not, you're being billed for them. And in this case, you're only being billed for execution. It changes the way the development happens.

像那样的事。但事实证明，一些实际上立即跳上服务器-无服务器的公司是一些最大的企业。为什么？因为你不需要管理任何东西，如果没有执行，你也不需要付钱。我的意思是，如果你运行了一整批SE2实例，不管你是否使用它们，你都会收到账单。在这种情况下，你只会被判死刑。它改变了发展的方式。

You don't launch everything and the kitchen sink as I said earlier, around servers, you're gonna see how your customers are using this.

你不会像我前面说的那样启动所有的东西和厨房的水槽，在服务器周围，你会看到你的客户是如何使用这个的。

And they quickly start iterating with [inaudible] X ray as being the debugging environment. Deliver step functions to build more complex applications.

他们很快就开始以[无法听到的]X射线作为调试环境进行迭代。提供步骤函数来构建更复杂的应用程序。

And there's a lot more things coming down in that pipeline, mostly because you can observe how your customers are using your product. For example, in DynamoDB we knew secondary indexes. Turns out customers want to draw on item levels access management. Much more important to them than secondary NDCs. Basically, customers reordered our road map.

在这个过程中还有很多事情要做，主要是因为你可以观察到你的客户是如何使用你的产品的。例如，在DynamoDB中，我们知道二级索引。结果表明，客户希望利用项目级别的访问管理。对他们来说比二级NDC更重要。基本上，顾客重新订购了我们的路线图。

And then we started delivering the things that mattered most to them. Which, I think is an important part in this. But, again, even though it looks like an MVP we can't treat it like an MVP because people will be building their business on it and they'll be depending on it.

然后我们开始交付对他们最重要的东西。我认为这是其中的一个重要部分。但是，尽管它看起来像一个MVP，我们不能把它当作MVP来对待，因为人们将在它上建立他们的业务，他们将依赖它。

So, it comes with a very different culture structure around it. Last year 1400 new features and services? As the number of teams grow, that of course accelerates as well. We use within AWS the same structure.

所以，它周围有一个非常不同的文化结构。去年1400个新功能和服务？随着团队数量的增加，当然也会加速。我们在AWS中使用相同的结构。

The Neptune team. The graph database is supposed to be in contact with their most important customer, or most let's say demanding customers.

海王星团队。图形数据库应该与他们最重要的客户保持联系，或者说是要求很高的客户。

And understand what their needs are. Each of these teams has their own customer set and customer base, and all built around road map.

了解他们的需求。每个团队都有自己的客户群和客户群，并且都是围绕路线图构建的。

The more services you get, the more road maps you get. But, this is really a very fast moving environment where the way that people are building software changed dramatically as well. If we would have taken the step in deciding for our customers how they should develop software, you probably would have been developing software in let's say the way that five years ago software, or 10 years ago. Because that's the structure you have. Instead of it, we need to start developing software how we would like to develop software in 2020, or 2025.

你得到的服务越多，你得到的路线图就越多。但是，这确实是一个快速变化的环境，人们构建软件的方式也发生了巨大的变化。如果我们能为我们的客户决定如何开发软件的话，你可能就会像五年前或者十年前那样开发软件了。因为这就是你的结构。相反，我们需要开始开发软件-我们希望在2020年或2025年开发软件。

That's the thinking that we have.

这就是我们的想法。

You can't do that by deciding for your customers.

你不能通过为你的顾客做决定来做到这一点。

You need to work closely with them and allow them to drive your innovation engine.

你需要与他们紧密合作，让他们驱动你的创新引擎。

Kyle Corbitt: About a decade ago, you wrote a blog post called working backwards.

Kyle Corbitt:大约十年前，你写了一篇名为“向后工作”的博客文章。

You remember the one I'm talking about?

你还记得我说的那个吗？

Werner Vogels: Yeah.

Werner Vogels:是的。

Kyle Corbitt: I'm curious. Could you describe the product development flow that you put in that post? And then tell me what you learned and whether Amazon still uses that structure.

Kyle Corbitt:我很好奇。你能描述一下你在那篇文章中的产品开发流程吗？然后告诉我你学到了什么，亚马逊是否还在使用这种结构。

Werner Vogels: We use it everywhere.

Werner Vogels:我们到处都用它。

The protocol working from the customer backwards. Amazon, we have a very strong focus on developing only those things that really matter for your customers, where even though we're a technology company, and I think if you're a heavy technology company, lots of engineering, there's a risk that engineers get in charge. If they get in charge, you do not necessarily build products, you build technology. For us there's a big difference between the two. I think what makes AWS, for example, successful, is because we focus on products. Meaning, what do we want to build for our customer? Much more like, oh, this is this very cool storage system that sits underneath there that we've never built before. Or how do we do global tables in DynamoDB? So there's all this amazing tech that we're building but that's not what's driving it. It's what do you want to build for your customer. What is the problem you want to solve? For them. We wanna make sure that, and whether that is in AWS, or whether that is in [inaudible] , or whether this opening a new office in Menlo Park. We use a process called working backwards. Why are we doing this? So the first thing you do, is you write a press release.

从客户向后运行的协议。亚马逊，我们非常专注于开发那些对你的客户真正重要的东西，即使我们是一家科技公司，我认为如果你是一家大型科技公司，很多工程公司，工程师就有可能负责。如果他们当家作主，你不一定要制造产品，而是制造技术。对我们来说，两者有很大的不同。例如，我认为AWS之所以成功，是因为我们专注于产品。意思是，我们想为我们的客户建造什么？更像是，哦，这是一个非常酷的存储系统，它位于我们从未建造过的地下。或者如何在DynamoDB中处理全局表？所以，我们正在建造的所有惊人的技术，但这并不是驱动它的原因。这是你想为你的客户建造的东西。你想解决什么问题？为了他们。我们想要确保这一点，无论是在AWS中，还是在[无法听到的]，或者这是否在门罗公园开设了一个新的办公室。我们使用一个名为“向后工作”的过程。我们为什么要这么做？所以你要做的第一件事就是写一份新闻稿。

And it's not a press release that will go out. It's a press release you write for yourself, where you richly describe in very clear and simple terms exactly what you're going to build.

也不是要发布的新闻稿。这是一份你为自己写的新闻稿，你用非常清晰而简单的语言描述了你将要构建的内容。

Then you write a document with let's say the 20 most frequent questions.

然后你写一个文档，比如说20个最常见的问题。

And then you have to answer those in very clear and simple terms as well.

然后，你必须用非常清晰和简单的术语来回答这些问题。

Sometimes, especially for more complex situations, we iterate on those first two documents maybe 10 to 15 times. Until it's really absolutely exactly clear what you're going to build.

有时，特别是在更复杂的情况下，我们迭代前两个文档可能10到15次。直到你完全搞清楚你要建什么。

And not more than that. Then, you write the UX Document, basically how are my customers going to use this? Or what is the interaction with the customer going to be? And then the fourth document is part of the user manual, glossary, and some other terms, things like that. At the end of that, you have a set of four documents that describes exactly what you're going to do.

仅此而已。然后，您编写UX文档，基本上我的客户将如何使用这个？或者与客户的互动是什么？然后，第四个文档是用户手册、术语表和其他一些术语的一部分，诸如此类。最后，您有一组四个文档，它们准确地描述了您将要做的事情。

And then the ruling within Amazon is that and thou shall not be billed more than that. Because, as engineers, and I'm one myself, you have the tendency to sort of ...

而亚马逊公司的裁决是，你不会收到比这更多的账单。因为，作为工程师，我也是其中之一，你有一种倾向.

Anything that makes it easy for you to build version two, you [inaudible] start putting that in version one.

任何让你很容易构建第二版的东西，你都会开始把它放进第一版。

That's not an option. It's really focusing on building that and exactly only that. It gives us a really strong structure around how to think about customers, how to feel about products, much more about technology.

这不是一个选择。它真正关注的是建立它，而恰恰是那样。它给了我们一个非常强大的结构，围绕着如何思考客户，如何去感受产品，更多的是关于技术。

This is the product you want to build. Now, what kind of technologies do we need for that? There's a very strong product thinking around that. It combines with another process that we have. Meetings at Amazon ... We have a moratorium on using slides. No PowerPoint, no Keynote, nothing like that. Why? Because in meetings, I think slides are deadly. Half of the room will be on their phones, and the other half will be already complaining by slide number two that they don't understand what you're talking about.

这是你想要生产的产品。现在，我们需要什么样的技术来做到这一点？围绕这一点，有一个非常强大的产品在思考。它与我们的另一个过程结合在一起。亚马逊的会议.。我们暂停使用幻灯片。没有PowerPoint，没有基调，没有那样的东西。为什么？因为在会议上，我认为幻灯片是致命的。一半的房间在他们的手机上，另一半的人已经在第二张幻灯片上抱怨他们不明白你在说什么。

That's obvious, because you haven't seen the whole presentation yet. We operate in Amazon with what's called six pagers.

这很明显，因为你还没看过整个演示文稿。我们在亚马逊经营所谓的六部寻呼机。

This is a six page document, a narrative that you have to write.

这是一个六页的文件，你必须写一个叙述。

And the first 30 minutes of a meeting will always be spent by reading this document in complete silence.

一次会议的头30分钟将永远以完全沉默的方式阅读这份文件。

Sometimes, half way through the reading, you go like “Guys, go back to the drawing board. Don't waste our time here.” Because why? Because it is very important because it's very hard to write a clear document if you do not have clarity of mind. Writing a narrative is extremely hard.

有时候，读到一半的时候，你会像“伙计们，回到画板上去。”不要浪费我们在这里的时间。“因为为什么？因为它是非常重要的，因为如果你没有清晰的头脑，就很难写出清晰的文档。写一个故事是非常困难的。

And this might be, there's often a collaborative effort.

这可能是，经常有一个合作的努力。

You'll write it, you'll give it to some of your colleagues for feedback, you put it in your drawer. A week later, you pick it up again, you revise it until you get to a point where you think you're really clear about describing whether it's a feature, or a product, or an activity, or a new business that you want to go into. After reading those six pages for 30 minutes, everybody in the room is on the same page. No pun intended by the way. Or pun intended, whatever you wanna say.

你会把它写下来，你会把它给你的一些同事，以得到反馈，你把它放在你的抽屉里。一周后，你再次拿起它，你修改它，直到你认为你真的很清楚地描述它是一个功能，一个产品，一个活动，或者一个新的业务，你想要进入。在阅读了这六页30分钟后，房间里的每个人都在同一个页面上。顺便说一下，没有双关语。或者双关语，不管你想说什么。

So no, you get very high quality discussion after that because everybody knows exactly what we're talking about. Now often part of that process is then there's an addendum to the six page will be the PR and FAQ and you'll iterate on those. We have a very unique culture around that.

所以不，在那之后你会得到高质量的讨论，因为每个人都知道我们在说什么。现在，这一过程的一部分通常是，六页的增编将是PR和FAQ，您将在这些文件上进行迭代。围绕这一点，我们有着非常独特的文化。

Kyle Corbitt: Five years ago, virtualization was still pretty new, a lot of companies were just moving to that. Today, everything is being containerized, you have lots of big customers moving to Lambda, to totally server-less platforms. Where do you think development is going to go five years from now? How are we going to be building our apps?

Kyle Corbitt:五年前，虚拟化还是很新的，很多公司只是在向这个方向发展。今天，一切都是集装箱化，你有很多大客户移动到Lambda，完全没有服务器的平台。你认为五年后的发展方向是什么？我们将如何构建我们的应用程序？

Werner Vogels: If I would have this crystal ball ... I would be sort of ... I do think I see quite a few companies skipping the containers step. More and more. I think some part of the pile of I think what makes containers popular, one thing there is everybody wanted to go to a more microservices environment, and I think that maps really well with container technologies. We can scale things up and down easily in the single components that you have. I think that matches the microservices thinking really well. I think most of the people that actually come into that phase often come out of the monolith phase, breaking up the monolith into those containers. People that start from scratch, more and more develop around server-less environments.

Werner Vogels:如果我想要这个水晶球.我会有点.。我确实看到很多公司跳过集装箱的步骤。越来越多。我想一部分我认为是什么使集装箱流行，有一件事是每个人都想去一个更微观的服务环境，我认为与集装箱技术的映射真的很好。我们可以在您拥有的单个组件中轻松地进行向上和向下的扩展。我认为这与微观服务的想法非常吻合。我认为大多数真正进入这一阶段的人通常都是从单核阶段出来的，他们把钻石分解成那些容器。从零开始的人，越来越多地围绕着服务器较少的环境进行开发。

You could even consider, at AWS, two container products. One is ECS, that's a container service, it's all around Docker and Docker capabilities and things like that.

你甚至可以考虑，在AWS，两个集装箱产品。一个是ECS，这是一个集装箱服务，它围绕着Docker和Docker功能之类的东西。

And deep integration for all the database services and then there's EKS which is managed [inaudible] beneath the service.

对所有数据库服务进行深度集成，然后是EKS，它在服务下面被管理[听不见]。

That's how we started off. The thing with containers, is especially before we deliver the Fargate and I'll talk about it in a minute, is that basically it almost brings you back to the pre-Cloud days. Suddenly, you need to manage multiple containers over multiple availability zones.

我们就是这样开始的。关于容器的问题，尤其是在我们交付Fargate之前-我一会儿再谈，基本上它会把你带回到云前的日子。突然之间，您需要管理多个可用区域上的多个容器。

There's almost so much that you need to map them onto virtual machines. Because these things don't run by themselves.

几乎有那么多，您需要将它们映射到虚拟机上。因为这些东西不是靠自己运行的。

You still need to manage the whole virtual machine environment underneath there. Even though containers is a great development abstraction, customers need to do a lot of work to run those containers.

您仍然需要管理整个虚拟机环境。尽管容器是一个很好的开发抽象，但是客户需要做大量的工作来运行这些容器。

So part of that will be taken care of because it's a managed service. But we also delivered something called Fargate. Fargate basically takes away all the management of virtual machines underneath there.

因此其中的一部分将被处理，因为它是一个托管服务。但我们也提供了一种叫做法尔盖特的东西。法尔盖特基本上夺走了所有虚拟机的管理。

So basically, just write a container, you drop it in there, it runs. Kind of.

基本上，只要写一个容器，你把它放进去，它就会运行。有点

That's the state where you want to be in. Now, I think every time when you need to do things that actually have nothing to do with building your product, or running your product, in most efficient way, then that's sort of a waste of effort. We continue to look at how can we take more and more of those pain points away? Because you know what, nobody cares who are running containers. Nobody cared about the virtual machines underneath there. It's just the tax that you had to pay.

这就是你想要进入的状态。现在，我认为，每次当你需要做的事情，实际上与建立你的产品无关，或运行你的产品，以最有效的方式，那么，这是一种浪费的努力。我们继续关注如何才能带走越来越多的疼痛点？因为你知道吗，没人在乎谁在经营集装箱。没有人关心那里下面的虚拟机。这只是你必须付的税。

And I think we're sort of bringing up especially I think the interaction in the [inaudible] group is really feeding many things back into the mainstream [inaudible] open source environment. Especially when it comes to things like security and things like that. How are we doing things differently five years ... Oh that was the question. Yeah, I think there's a lot more server-less development because I think we see already an enormous pick up in and around that. I think we'll see more and more tools and support platforms and infrastructure around the ability to build more complex server-less environments. Better integration I think with other services, that's definitely things that we'll see. But I want to shift to something else. I think one thing that we will be doing, I hope, five years from now is that everybody will be taking security as their number one job. Whether you're the CEO, whether the CTO, whether you're an engineer, we all need to become security conscious and we all need to become security engineers. I think if you've looked at the past four or five years, I mean there isn't a week that goes by where there is not some massive data breach. Yeah? It's embarrassing. I think us as technologists and as digital business leaders, we should be embarrassed. But we are not. Where's the outrage? We almost seem to accept this as being sort of part of our ... It's not.

我认为我们正在提出，特别是我认为，在[不可听不到的]小组中的互动，正在将许多东西反馈到主流的[不可听见的]开放源码环境中。尤其是在安全之类的事情上。五年来我们做的事情有什么不同.。哦，这就是问题所在。是的，我认为有更多的服务器-没有开发，因为我认为我们已经看到了一个巨大的增长和周围。我认为，我们将看到越来越多的工具和支持平台和基础设施的能力，以建立更复杂的服务器-更少的环境。更好的集成，我认为与其他服务，这是肯定的事情，我们将看到。但我想转移到别的地方。我认为五年后我们将做的一件事是，每个人都会把安全作为他们的第一份工作。无论你是首席执行官，还是首席技术官，无论你是一名工程师，我们都需要成为安全意识，我们都需要成为安全工程师。我想，如果你看看过去的四五年，我的意思是，每周都不会有大规模的数据泄露。嗯太尴尬了。我认为，作为技术专家和数字商业领袖，我们应该感到尴尬。但我们不是。愤怒在哪里？我们似乎都认为这是我们.不是的。

You know? Without protecting your customers, you have no business.

你知道不保护你的客户，你就没有生意。

And I think this is something that maybe as a young business as a startup, you didn't think about 10 years ago, or five years ago. Where, I think everybody needs to start with thinking about, oh this is the kind of data I'm collecting from my customers, how am I protecting my customers? And you may say, “Oh, who is interested in when Werner rented this bike here?” Well, you know, that dataset plus two other [inaudible] datasets that you may get from other places may have a very valuable position for ... I think we all need to become extremely security conscious and make sure that we can continue to protect our customers. It would be embarrassing I think as young businesses to actually start losing your data of your customers. It will impact everybody else in your environment. Not just as customers, but it will reflect on other young businesses as well. I think, if you collect data off your customers, if you have consumer data, you have a grave responsibility to keep that data secure.

我认为，作为一家初创企业，作为一家年轻企业，你在10年前或5年前都没有想到过这件事。在哪里，我认为每个人都需要开始思考，哦，这就是我从我的客户那里收集的数据，我是如何保护我的客户的呢？你可能会说，“哦，谁对沃纳在这里租这辆自行车感兴趣？”嗯，你知道，数据集加上你可能从其他地方得到的另外两个[听不到的]数据集可能对你有一个非常有价值的位置.我认为我们都需要有高度的安全意识，并确保我们能够继续保护我们的客户。我认为，作为一个年轻的企业，真正开始丢失你的客户数据将是一件令人尴尬的事情。它会影响你环境中的其他人。不仅仅是作为客户，它也会影响到其他年轻企业。我认为，如果你从你的客户那里收集数据，如果你有消费者数据，你就有责任保护这些数据的安全。

And you know, there's also tools for it.

你知道，也有一些工具。

There's encryption and really give you dozens of different tools that all can help you do this. But, you need to keep it in your mind that that's your first and foremost job. Of course, you're all thinking “Yeah, but we don't know. We're building this new service. We're building this new consumer service. We don't think ...” No, I think the only way if you actually build your new business without security in mind, it will be very hard to retrofit it into it.

这里有加密功能，可以为您提供数十种不同的工具，它们都可以帮助您完成这一任务。但是，你需要记住这是你的首要工作。当然，你们都在想“是的，但我们不知道。我们正在建设这项新服务。我们正在建设新的消费者服务。我们不认为.“不，我认为唯一的方法，如果你真的建立你的新业务在没有安全考虑，这将是非常困难的改造它。

You will have a nightmare, let's say two, three years down the road when you become successful and you grow and you need to retrofit security? You're gonna be in a major mess. It means also that your development processes, because that's what you asked about, need to change. Security needs to become a default part of your for example, your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. It needs to trigger events. Whenever you're building something and someone adds a new open source library to it, an alarm should be going off with someone to inspect why are we adding this? Why are we doing this? Did we check this out from a security point of view? Your development pipeline itself needs to be secure, there needs to be all sorts of alarms going off in that whole section, and security needs to become your first and foremost concern.

当你成功的时候，你会有一个噩梦，比如说两三年后，你会成长，你需要改造安全？你会陷入一片混乱。这也意味着您的开发过程，因为这是您的要求，需要改变。安全性需要成为您的默认部分，例如，您的持续集成和持续部署管道。它需要触发事件。每当您正在构建某个东西，并且有人向它添加了一个新的开源库时，应该会有人发出警报，以检查我们为什么要添加这个？我们为什么要这么做？我们从安全角度看过了吗？您的开发管道本身需要是安全的，需要在整个部分中发出各种各样的警报，安全需要成为您最关心的问题。

And there's lots of automation tools around it. So you deploy, you can use Amazon Inspector to test about all sorts of vulnerabilities but if you do continuous integration, and continuous deployment, especially if you for example you [inaudible] or in health care.

它周围有很多自动化工具。因此，部署时，您可以使用Amazon检查器测试各种漏洞，但如果您进行持续集成和持续部署，特别是在您(无法听到)或医疗保健方面。

You're subject to all sorts of regulatory requirements. How do you know that this new next five lines of code, that you just wrote, don't violate your HIPAA? Or, that you're still in compliance with whatever the financial regulator wants from you. We have all sorts of automation tools that can continuously test this for you but you do need to do it.

你要遵守各种各样的监管要求。你怎么知道新的五行代码，你刚刚写的，不会违反你的HIPAA？或者，你仍然遵从金融监管机构对你的任何要求。我们有各种各样的自动化工具，可以不断地为您测试这一点，但是您确实需要这样做。

And it needs to be in your mind.

它需要在你的脑海里。

So, development, especially if it continues deployment changes radically from how we've been approaching security in the past. Now, I honestly believe continuous deployment actually is better from a security point of view. Because in the past, you would write 50,000 lines of code, security team would come in, would review it, would bless it, and they had no clue what they were doing. Would bless it, 50,000 lines of code, you have no idea.

因此，开发，特别是如果它继续部署，从根本上改变了我们过去处理安全问题的方式。现在，我真诚地认为，从安全的角度来看，持续部署实际上更好。因为在过去，你会写50，000行代码，安全小组会进来，检查它，祝福它，他们不知道他们在做什么。祝福它，50，000行代码，你不知道。

And you would deploy it. Changing five lines of code? Is something that you can actually test with automated processes, automatic reasoning and things like that, that you actually are building the right thing. I think it is great advances for security, we do need to keep security in our mind. I hope that in five years time, not necessarily we're all security engineers, but we're all super security conscious and protecting our customers will be our first concern. It is at Amazon. It will be forever our number one investment area, both in terms of intellectual capital, as well as in financial capital. Without protecting your customers you do not have a business.

你会部署它。换了五行代码？你可以用自动化的过程，自动推理之类的东西来测试，你实际上是在构建正确的东西。我认为这是安全方面的巨大进步，我们确实需要牢记安全。我希望五年后，我们不一定都是安全工程师，但我们都有高度的安全意识，保护我们的客户将是我们的首要考虑。在亚马逊。它将永远是我们在智力资本和金融资本方面的第一大投资领域。如果不保护你的客户，你就没有生意可做。

Kyle Corbitt: Beyond not taking security seriously enough, are there any other common mistakes or errors you see startups doing as they use AWS?

Kyle Corbitt:除了对安全不够重视之外，你看到初创企业在使用AWS时还有其他常见的错误或错误吗？

Werner Vogels: Well, first and foremost I think there's a technical one. We've got quite a few people that are for the first time AWS users but that have already had experiences, let's say building services and using a traditional data center. Using AWS as a data center makes that you lose out. I think, yeah there're some advantages to it, you have some elasticity and things like that that you can make use of but if you don't use the higher level services around security, around data analytics, around mobile, all of these where we take away a lot of the development for a lot of the hard, let's say the heavy lifting.

Werner Vogels:首先，我认为有一个技术问题。我们有相当多的人是第一次使用AWS用户，但他们已经有了经验，比如构建服务和使用传统的数据中心。使用AWS作为数据中心会使您损失惨重。我认为，是的，它有一些优点，你有一些弹性，你可以利用，但是如果你不使用更高层次的服务，围绕安全，数据分析，移动，所有这些，我们带走了很多的发展，很多困难，比方说，繁重的工作。

You're losing out. If you just treat it as a data center with just some virtual machines and databases and storage, that's not where your major productivity improvements are going to come from.

你输定了。如果你只是把它当作一个数据中心，只有一些虚拟机、数据库和存储空间，那么这并不是你的主要生产力提高的地方。

Some, but not the major ones. Next to that, more of a meta level, you have to figure out what kind of company you are.

一些，但不是主要的。其次，更多的元水平，你必须弄清楚你是什么样的公司。

And I think there's two different companies, two different styles. One of them is you go for the high grow, get big fast kind of thing. Acquire as many customers as possible, as quickly as possible, not necessarily thinking that much about revenue, taking lots of investors money and really get big really fast to become successful and then probably be acquired. 'Cause that's why people invest in you.

我认为有两家不同的公司，两种不同的风格。其中之一就是你追求高增长，得到大的快类的东西。尽可能快地收购更多的客户，而不一定要考虑太多的收入问题，需要大量的投资者投资，而且很快就能获得成功，然后很可能会被收购。因为这就是人们投资你的原因。

That makes your use of AWS and your use of Cloud very different from if you're ...

这使得你对AWS的使用和云的使用非常不同，如果你是.

And we support that really well. Because you don't have to worry that much about getting capacity, or services, whatever. It's all there.

我们非常支持这一点。因为你不必为获得容量或服务等问题担心那么多。都在那里。

And it comes with a clear cost picture as well, that's different. Or, if you want to become a sustainable company. Basically, I want to build this company but still be in business 30 years from now. Not necessarily focused on acquisition but just building a business. I think if you guys follow Signal V. Noise, the guys from Basecamp, DHH and others and Jason [inaudible] talk a lot about how they wanna be in business still.

它也有一个清晰的成本图，这是不同的。或者，如果你想成为一家可持续发展的公司。基本上，我想建立这家公司，但30年后还在营业。不一定把重点放在收购上，而只是建立一家企业。我认为，如果你们遵循信号V噪声，来自Basecamp，DHH和其他人和杰森[听不见]的人谈论了很多他们想要做生意的人。

They want to still do this business 10, 20 years from now. How do they do that? And that requires different architectures, it requires much more control of cost, it requires a clear association between cost and customer acquisition, so AWS supports that as well but it requires you to build very different architectures. Because you want much more control of cost and scale, than in the other one where you're not that much concerned about cost, but you're much more concerned about can we change really fast so we can address our customer concerns because we need to grow really fast. Jeff often makes the distinction between mercenaries and missionaries. Mercenaries are the startup founders that are in it for the money.

他们还想在10到20年后继续做这个生意。他们怎么做到的？这需要不同的架构，它需要更多的成本控制，它需要成本和客户获取之间的明确关联，所以AWS也支持这一点，但它要求您构建非常不同的体系结构。因为你想要更多地控制成本和规模，而不是在另一个你不太关心成本的地方，但你更关心的是我们是否能很快地改变，这样我们就可以解决客户的担忧，因为我们需要快速增长。杰夫经常区分雇佣军和传教士。雇佣兵是创业公司的创始人，他们为了钱而投入其中。

And missionaries are the ones that are in it for the love of the product. I want to build this product. Or I want to build this business.

传教士就是那些为了对产品的爱而在里面的人。我想生产这个产品。或者我想建立这个生意。

And you support both, they're both valid.

你支持两者，他们都是有效的。

They're both valid approaches to entrepreneurship. It's just that the tech support and the tech that you build for these different groups is very very different. So, figure out what you are.

它们都是创业的有效途径。只是你为这些不同的群体建立的技术支持和技术是非常不同的。所以，弄清楚你是什么。

Kyle Corbitt: Alright, well thank you so much.

Kyle Corbitt:好吧，非常感谢。

This has been wonderful and we've learned so much. And everyone, a big thanks to Dr. Werner Vogels.


这真是太棒了，我们学到了很多。感谢沃纳·沃格斯医生。
