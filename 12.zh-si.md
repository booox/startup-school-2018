# PR and Content for Growth

Geoff Ralston: Now we have Kat, with Craig later, to talk about PR and content for growth. Thanks.

罗尔斯顿:现在，我们有KAT。等等有克雷格，讨论的为增长而做公关和内容。谢啦。

Kat Manalac: Thank you, Jeff.

谢了，杰夫。

Geoff Ralston: I already introduced you.

杰夫·罗尔斯顿:我已经介绍过你了。

Kat Manalac: Okay, cool. Hi, everyone, I'm Kat Mañalac.

好的，酷。嗨，大家好，我是Kat Mañalac。

I'm a partner at Y Combinator. During my time at YC I've helped hundreds of companies with their launches, with their pitches, with their initial interactions with press.

我是YCombinator的合伙人。在YC工作期间，我帮助了数百家公司推出产品，以及他们的展示，并与媒体进行了初步的互动。

I'm going to be joined Craig Cannon who creates a lot of the content for YC. We're going to be giving you a framework for thinking about content marketing and press as an early stage founder. Before we jump in let's define some terms. When we talk about content we're talking about anything that you create and distribute on your own channels to attract a specific audience or user, so that means anything you make for your blog, YouTube, podcasts, anything that you create and distribute yourself. When we talk about PR or press we're referring to an early stage start-up pitching and independent third party publication, so if it's news, blogs, anything that's external to your channels. As a founder it's one of your primary jobs to tell the story of your start-up. You'll need to tell that story to investors, to press, to users, to potential employees, and you'll need to tell that story throughout the entire lifetime of your company so it's best to start practicing early. You will need to tell it clearly and succinctly because the goal is to tell it in a way where it makes it easy for other people to repeat that story for you and help you spread the word.

我将加入克雷格·坎农的行列,他为YC创造了很多内容。我们将为您提供一个框架,让您将内容、营销和新闻作为早期创办人来思考。在我们进入之前,让我们先定义一些术语。当我们谈论内容时,我们谈论的是你在自己的频道上创建和发布的任何东西,以吸引特定的受众或用户,这意味着你为你的博客、YouTube、播客,以及你自己创建和发布的任何东西所做的一切。当我们谈论公关或新闻时,我们指的是早期的创业、推销和独立的第三方出版物,所以如果是新闻,博客,任何与你的频道无关的东西。作为一名创始人,讲述你创业的故事是你的主要工作之一。你需要把这个故事告诉投资者、压力、用户和潜在的员工,你需要在公司的整个生命周期里讲述这个故事,所以最好早点开始练习。你需要清楚而简洁地讲述它,因为它的目标是以一种让其他人很容易为你重复这个故事并帮助你传播这个故事的方式来讲述它。

That's how anything becomes viral. Making good content lets you shape that story and put it out into the world yourself, and then pitching it to press helps you put that story in front of a potentially much larger audience.

这就是什么都变得像病毒一样。制作好的内容可以让你塑造故事，并把它发布到你自己的世界中，然后把它发布给媒体，这有助于你将故事摆在更多潜在的观众面前。

The combination of the two can be really powerful, but making good content and setting up a press practice is a lot of work, so you have to decide and hopefully I'll help you go through that decision tree whether it's worth doing at the stage where you're at right now. We will cover when and why to start thinking about doing content marketing, how to think about content like a product and how to measure it, how to DIY your own PR, and then we'll open it up to questions. A couple things before we get started. First, for the majority of you, before you focus too much time and energy getting the word out about what you're building, make sure that you're making something people want. Make sure you're focusing on the right things. It all comes back to this, writing code, and talking to users. No amount of press or content marketing is going to help you if you don't have something people want. How do you know that you have something people want? You talk to your users. Additionally, talking to your users will make it easier for you to create better content, and do press that will target them. Second, press is not a scalable user acquisition strategy, it can help you get some early inbound, it can help get you in front of early adopters, but it's not something you can rely on long term for growth.It's not something you can really control, and it's not even the best way to talk to your earliest users, which is why we're gonna talk about content, and content marketing first, and I will let Craig kick it off here.

两者的结合可以非常强大,但是制作好的内容和建立一个新闻实践是很多工作,所以你必须作出决定,希望我能帮助你通过决策树,它是否值得在你现在所处的阶段去做。我们将讨论什么时候和为什么开始考虑做内容营销,如何像产品一样思考内容,如何衡量它,如何DIY您自己的公关,然后我们将开放它的问题。在我们开始之前有几件事。首先,对于大多数人来说,在你把太多的时间和精力花在说出你正在建设的东西之前,一定要确保你在制造别人想要的东西。确保你专注于正确的事情。这一切又回到了这个问题上,编写代码和与用户交谈。如果你没有别人想要的东西,再多的媒体或内容营销也不会对你有帮助。你怎么知道你有别人想要的东西?你和你的用户交谈。此外,与用户交谈将使您更容易创建更好的内容,并按下会针对他们的内容。第二,新闻不是一种可伸缩的用户获取策略,它可以帮助你尽早进入市场,它可以帮助你在早期用户面前,但它不是你可以长期依赖的东西,也不是你能真正控制的东西,它甚至也不是与你最早的用户交谈的最好方式,这就是为什么我们要首先谈论内容和内容营销的原因。我会让克雷格在这里开球。

Craig Cannon: All right, hey. Hey everyone, I'm Craig, I work with Kat at YC, do a podcast and all that kinda stuff. All right, so I ... Before working at YC I worked at a place called The Onion. We made fake news before it was cool.

好的，嘿。嘿，各位，我是克雷格，我和凯特在YC工作，做播客之类的。好吧，所以我。。。在YC工作之前我在一个叫The Onion的地方工作。我们在假新闻变得很潮之前就干这行了。

I did the Photoshop ... So, putting Joe Biden's head on a fat guys body in front of the White House, that kind of thing.

我做了Photoshop。。。所以，把乔·拜登的头放在白宫前面的一个胖子身上，诸如此类的事情。

Then after working at The Onion I co-founded a company and we made a thing called Comedy Hack Day where developers and comedians work together to make funny apps, and then we had these big events. Alexis judged a bunch of them. Now, I work at YC, so hopefully that's the least logical connection of things in this deck.

然后，在The Onion公司工作之后，我与人共同创建了一家公司，我们制作了一个叫Comedy Hack Day的东西，开发者和喜剧演员一起制作有趣的应用程序，然后我们举办了这些大型活动。Alexis被判了一堆。现在，我在YC工作，所以希望这是最不符合逻辑的。

Today I'm gonna talk about content, content marketing. Some people call it content marketing, some people call it editorial, some other people call it brand publishing, some people call it social content, and them some other people call it a word I don't know, but like Kat said, this is just basically everything you make. So, it's gonna be your podcast, YouTube, blog, video, social stuff, whatever. We can get more specific and granular about each of those channels if you want to talk one on one, but this is gonna be kind of broad, across the board advice, that hopefully you can use. So, the number one question I get is, when to start? Really, the thing is, just like Kat said, and just like Gustav said last week about applying growth tactics, you really want to be doing this after you've made something people want, and you're confident that their not churning, 'cause if they're churning, you're just wasting a ton of energy, and a ton of money. So, assuming you've hit that point, you can start thinking about content marketing. A lot of people do this in the beginning because they can't afford paid acquisition.

今天我要谈谈内容,内容营销。有人称它为内容营销,有人称它为社论,有人称它为品牌出版,有人称它为社交内容,还有一些人称它为我不知道的词,但正如凯特所说,这基本上就是你创造的一切。所以,这将是你的播客,YouTube,博客,视频,社交之类的。如果你想一对一地谈论这些频道,我们可以得到更具体更细致的信息,但这将是一种广泛的,全面的建议,希望你能使用。所以,我得到的第一个问题是,什么时候开始?真的,就像凯特说的,就像古斯塔夫上周所说的那样,在你做了别人想要的事情之后,你真的想这么做,而且你相信他们不会翻身,因为如果他们在翻动,你就是在浪费一吨精力和一大笔钱。因此,假设你已经达到了这一点,你可以开始考虑内容营销。很多人在一开始就这样做,因为他们买不起有偿收购。

The way I think about it is the content as product. Hopefully you can just apply all the learnings from the lectures earlier on about product, and just throw them right at content. So, when you think about content as product the only thing you have to change from the YC advice of make something people want, is make something your customers want. You're no longer bounded by nothing. You have this very clear market that you're going after, and you want to make something that they're interested in.

我认为这是作为产品的内容。希望你能把前面讲到的关于产品的所有知识都运用起来,并把它们放在内容上。所以,当你把内容看作产品时,你唯一需要改变的是YC关于让人们想要的东西的建议,那就是制造你的客户想要的东西。你不再被什么都束缚住了。你有一个非常明确的市场,你想要做一些他们感兴趣的东西。

I was talking with Wade Foster from Zapier, they do a ton of content marketing, it's really good, and they write about it on their blog, you can check it out ... Oh sweet, all right cool, thanks man.

我和Zapier的韦德·福斯特谈过,他们做了大量的内容营销,这真的很好,他们在博客上写到了,你可以去看看.哦,太好了,很酷,谢谢你。

What he was saying was that in the early days what they were doing was making things that Hacker News wanted, but it turns out that Hacker News and their customers was not a 100% overlap, so they were spending all of this energy generating this content to get people through the door, but those weren't actually the customers that they were looking for. So, just keep that in mind. Now that you've committed to doing content marketing you're going to do this.

他所说的是，在早期，他们所做的是制造Hacker News想要的东西，但事实证明，Hacker News和他们的客户并不是100%的重叠，所以他们把所有这些能量都花在制造这些内容上，让人们通过门，但这些实际上并不是他们要找的客户。所以，记住这一点。现在，您已经致力于内容营销，您将做到这一点。

What you need to do is pick a goal. So, there are basically two things that early stage companies want. Engagement.

你需要做的是选择一个目标。因此，初期公司想要的东西基本上有两个。互动。

If you're a social company ...

如果你是个社交公司。。。

That's like Instagram, whatever, those time on site ... Anyone else, it's gonna be conversions.

就像Instagram，不管什么，在现场的时候。。。其他人，都是转换。

There's this third thing called "brand", which is kind of like this vague misty thing about how people perceive you, you really don't need to worry about this early on.

还有第三个叫“品牌”的东西，就像人们对你的模糊印象一样，你真的不需要这么早就担心。

I mean, obviously you don't want to do evil things and have people hate you, but it's much harder to comprehend and work towards. So, engagement or conversions. Now that you're going, you want to just set up analytics. Sue Hale talked about this, but really it's super basic stuff.

我的意思是，很明显，你不想做坏事，也不想让别人恨你，但这很难理解，也很难实现。所以，订婚或转换。现在你要去了，你想要建立分析学。苏·黑尔说过，但实际上这是超级基本的东西。

The first thing I would do is set up Mixpanel, not Google Analytics, but something similar to Mixpanel will get the job done. You're just tracking where people are coming in, what they're doing, what they're clicking on, how long they're on the site, all that stuff.

我要做的第一件事是设置MixPanel，而不是Google Analytics，但是类似于MixPanel的东西会完成这项工作。你只是在跟踪人们进来的地方，他们在做什么，他们在点击什么，他们在网站上呆了多长时间，诸如此类的事情。

Then the next thing you want to do is install a Facebook pixel, again, this might not be super valuable to you in the beginning, but a lot of YC companies launch without a Facebook pixel, and what this is gonna do is capture who's hitting your site who's logged into Facebook, so that you can later re-market at them.

接下来你要做的是安装一个Facebook像素，同样，这可能在一开始对你来说并不是什么超级有价值的事情，但是很多YC公司没有Facebook像素就推出了，这样做的目的是捕捉谁进入了你的网站，谁登录到了Facebook，这样你就可以在以后对他们重新进行市场营销。

This is gonna be much cheaper than any other kind of Facebook audience that you can create. So, you want to do this, because if you launch on Hacker News and have 10,000 people hit your site, and you don't have it installed, you won't know who it is afterward. All right, so the next most common question I get is, what platform? This one's actually not that difficult. You just want to find your customers. So, you just talk to them, be like, "Where do you hang out? Do you hang out on Reddit, Instagram, whatever?" You can look at your referred data, but this is really all you have to do, because your objective is to find people like them, and then once you're hanging out there long enough you're gonna be able to figure out what does well there. For instance, essays ... Like, Paul Grahams essays, they do well on Hacker News. Make-up tutorials do well on YouTube, vlogging, all that kind of stuff, because you're gonna want to make the stuff that does well on those platforms.

这将比你能创造的任何其他类型的Facebook用户都便宜得多。所以,你想这么做,因为如果你在黑客新闻上发布,有1万人登陆你的网站,而你没有安装它,你就不会知道它是谁了。好吧,下一个最常见的问题是,什么平台?这个其实没那么难。你只想找到你的顾客。所以,你只需要跟他们说,“你在哪里闲逛?你在Reddit,Instagram上玩吗?”你可以查看你的参考数据,但这是你要做的所有事情,因为你的目标是找到像他们一样的人,然后一旦你在那里逗留足够长的时间,你就能知道什么是好的。比如散文.。比如保罗·格拉汉姆的文章,他们在“黑客新闻”上做得很好。化妆教程在youtube上做得很好,vlog,诸如此类的东西,因为你会想要把那些在这些平台上做得很好的东西。
ou
This is for two reasons. Distribution is really hard even for huge companies. A lot of companies just rely on paid acquisitions, like boosted posts on Facebook, that kind of thing, and you have no money. So, assuming these two things are true you have to figure out where your customers are, and you have to figure out what does well there.

这有两个原因。即使对大公司来说,分销也是非常困难的。很多公司只是依赖于有偿收购,比如Facebook上的推文,诸如此类的事情,而你却没有钱。因此,假设这两件事是真的,你必须找出你的客户在哪里,你必须找出哪里做得好。

Two examples. So, Scentbird, they're a YC company. They do perfume and make-up subscription box, they do Instagram influencer marketing, you can read all about this online, they blogged about it a bunch. Another example is YC. So YC, although PG, Jessica, Robert, and Trevor might not say this, has been doing content marketing since the very beginning, even before, so with Paul's essays, and then Hacker News was built, and then those essays do really well, and that's the exact kind of audience that would create a start-up.

两个例子。所以,Scentbird,他们是一家YC公司。他们做香水和化妆订阅盒,他们做Instagram有影响力的营销,你可以在网上看到这一切,他们在博客上写了一堆。另一个例子是YC。所以YC,虽然PG,杰西卡,罗伯特和特雷弗可能不会这么说,但从一开始就一直在做内容营销,甚至在之前,保罗的文章,然后哈克新闻被创建,然后这些文章做得很好,这正是创造一个新的开始的受众类型。

They just kinda rinse and repeat. All right, so now that you found out where you're gonna go and generally what you want to be making, I think not enough people spend enough time brainstorming. Sounds kinda silly, but most content, because people don't spend enough time brainstorming, ends up being derivative of the average of all the other stuff people see, so it doesn't stand out, and it looks like all the other stuff, because you got the ideas from the other people whose blogs you're reading, or your competitors, whatever. My example of this is going back to The Onion.

他们只是清洗和重复。好吧，现在你知道你要去哪里了，一般你想做什么了，我认为没有足够的人花足够的时间头脑风暴。听起来有点傻，但大多数内容，因为人们没有花足够的时间进行头脑风暴，最终会衍生出人们所看到的所有其他东西的平均值，所以它并不引人注目，而且看起来就像所有其他东西一样，因为你从那些你正在阅读博客的人或你的竞争对手那里得到了一些想法。我的例子是The Onion。

The Onion's been around for 30 years, maybe more at this point, and they've had hundreds of people work there.

The Onion已经存在了30年了，也许更久了，他们已经有数百人在那里工作了。

This is how The Onion picks headlines, and I think it's particularity important, because it's allowed them to create consistently good stuff with a lot of different people over a long period of time.

这就是The Onion是如何挑选标题的，我认为它的特殊性很重要，因为它允许他们在很长一段时间内与许多不同的人一起创造出一致的好东西。

The way The Onion picks headlines, is they have say 10 writers, each writer is responsible for 10 to 15 headlines a week, and then they email those headlines to an editor, the editor removes everyone's name, and then they just pick their favorite as a group. So, the objective is to have only 5% to 10% roughly survive.

 The Onion挑标题的方式是，他们有10个作者，每个作家负责10到15个标题，然后他们把这些标题发邮件给一个编辑，编辑去掉每个人的名字，然后他们挑选自己最喜欢的标题作为一个小组。所以，目标是只有5%到10%的生存。

What this is really good at is, first of all, it removes biases for like who's the CEO, who's the new guy or girl, whatever, and it also gets you past the point of those first three ideas, which are kind of the same from everyone.

真正擅长的是，首先，它消除了像谁是CEO，谁是新来的男人或女孩之类的偏见，它还让你超越了前三种想法的要点，这些想法对每个人来说都是一样的。

This is a huge problem, and if you go on just any average company blog they're all writing about the same stuff. So, it's a huge mistake, I think The Onion got it right.

这是一个很大的问题，如果你继续写任何普通的公司博客，他们都在写同样的东西。所以，这是一个巨大的错误，我想 The Onion是对的。

There's This American Life about it if you want to learn more.

如果你想了解更多，这是美国人的生活。

That's how you get this.

你就是这么得到这个的。

This is one of my favorite ever.

这是我的最爱之一。

It's before my time, but it's so good. Oh, man. All right. Can we just stay here for the rest of this? No, I'm just kidding. All right, so now you want to make something good. Again, this is dumb stuff that should be self evident, but I don't know it doesn't seem to be based on the internet.

这是我的时间之前，但它太好了。哦，伙计。那好吧。剩下的时间我们就呆在这儿好吗? 不，我开玩笑的。好吧，现在你想做点好的。同样，这些愚蠢的东西应该是不言而喻的，但我不知道它似乎不是基于互联网的。

What does that mean? That means dedicating real time. So, to break down what I talked about before, maybe that's an hour a week, or every two weeks brainstorming, and then ...

那是什么意思? 这就意味着要付出真正的时间。所以，分解一下我之前说的，也许是一周一个小时，或者每两周一次头脑风暴，然后。。。

It could take you a whole day, it could take you two days, it could take you three days to write a blog post. Maybe in the early days you can't do that, but you should let that amount of time dictate how often you can put stuff out, rather than go the other way, and be like, shit I have to get a thing out every week, and then you write a post in 10 minutes, and it's garbage. So, you're just wasting your time. You also want to dedicate good people.Thats not to say that you're hiring bad people, but what it's saying is that you want to dedicate the people who have actual domain expertise, and can lend something that's interesting to the rest of the world.

你可能要花一整天的时间，可能要花两天的时间，也可能要花三天的时间来写一篇博客文章。也许在早期你不能这么做，但你应该让时间来决定你能多久把东西拿出来一次，而不是走另一条路，就像是，我必须每周拿出一件东西，然后你在10分钟内写一篇文章，这是垃圾。所以，你只是在浪费时间。这并不是说你在雇用坏人，而是说你想让那些拥有真正领域专业知识的人奉献给你，并且可以借给世界上其他地方一些有趣的东西。

That means usually a co-founder, a lead developer, that kind of things. Just two other little things from the media world, you need to be prepared to edit all the time. Just really be precise about your language, 'cause people don't spend that much time on your site, or your video, or whatever. You need to be prepared to kill a lot of your work, and that really sucks, but you have to do it. Like I said, at The Onion, most headlines, by definition, would not make it through.

这通常意味着一个联合创始人，一个领先的开发人员，类似的事情。只有两个来自媒体世界的小东西，你需要随时准备编辑。对你的语言要确切一点，因为人们不会花那么多时间在你的网站上，或者你的视频上，或者其他什么东西上。你需要做好准备去杀了你的很多工作，这真的很糟糕，但你必须去做。就像我说的，在The Onion上，大多数的标题，从定义上来说，不会通过。

I think for a company that's really hard to do, but you can easily kill 25% of your stuff.

我认为对于一个真的很难做的公司来说，你可以很容易地杀死25%的你的东西。

This is ...

这是。。。

I want to illustrate why this is important. Most people think that they're competing with people that make the same stuff that they make.

我想说明为什么这很重要。大多数人认为，他们是在与制造相同产品的人竞争。

That is 100% not true. You are competing with this. Elon Musk smoking weed on Joe Rogan's podcast.

那是100%不对的。你在和这个竞争。埃隆·马斯克在乔·罗根的播客上抽大麻。

I haven't checked the views, but I think it's probably like 10 million now, and this was like a two or three hour podcast.

我还没看过，但我想现在大概有一千万了，这就像是两三个小时的播客。

This is the internet. You're competing with this guy. You're competing with porn. You're competing with everything else on the internet, and once you really let that sink into your brain, you will have the motivation to make something that's both valuable, and engaging. Oh man, that was a good podcast too. All right, then the next thing, this is the part that's really hard for me, is promotion. Promotion is both incredibly boring, and totally necessary.

这是互联网。你在和这个家伙竞争。你在和色情片竞争。你正在和互联网上的其他东西竞争，一旦你真的让它们进入你的大脑，你就会有动力去做一些既有价值又有吸引力的事情。哦，伙计，那也是一个不错的播客。好吧，接下来，对我来说真的很难，那就是升职。升职既是令人难以置信的无聊，也是完全必要的。

This means sharing articles out over and over on your Twitter feed, figuring out new different creative ways to do it. A lot of people will tell you to make a version for each platform. You can do this, but again, you're gonna be optimizing for one place where your customers are. YC, so now I clip up the podcast and put it on Instagram, and that's cool, but we're still get way more podcast downloads than we are getting Instagram views.

这意味着在你的Twitter feed上一次又一次地分享文章，想出新的，不同的，有创意的方法来做到这一点。很多人会告诉你为每个平台做一个版本。你可以做到这一点，但再次，你将优化一个地方，你的客户在哪里。YC，所以现在我把播客剪辑下来放到Instagram上，这很酷，但是我们仍然可以获得比Instagram更多的播客下载。

That's just how it goes. Not everything's gonna work everywhere.

事情就是这样的。不是每件事都能在任何地方起作用。

I'm putting this slide in here twice, because if I were watching this talk this would be the thing that id be like, "Oh yeah man, I got it don't worry about it.", and then I would skip over it, and then I would have played myself because I'm dumb and lazy, and I would not promote it enough ...

我把这张幻灯片放进这里两次，因为如果我看了这个演讲，我会说，“哦，是的，伙计，我明白了，不用担心。”然后我就跳过它，然后我就会玩我自己，因为我又笨又懒，而且我不会把它推销得太多。。。

And Ice-T is awesome. All right, so just really quickly I'm gonna rip through a couple examples. So, Gustav talked about this one last week. SEO, Airbnb made a bunch of city guides, so these are both super useful, they get you on the site, you can hit someone with a Facebook pixel, you can get your brand in there, and then you can convert.

冰是很棒的。好吧，所以我很快就会找出几个例子。古斯塔夫上周说过这件事。SEO，Airbnb做了一堆城市指南，所以这些都是超级有用的，他们让你在网站上，你可以打某人与Facebook像素，你可以把你的品牌在那里，然后你可以转换。

This is such a dream for them.

这是他们的梦想。

Influencer. Scentbird.

影响者。仙鸟。

Influencer marketing.

影响者营销。

If you Google those two words you'll read a bunch blog posts about that. Customer profiles. So, Zapier who I mentioned earlier, they help non-technical people work with API's by doing all these integrations for them. What's particularly cool about this is that they are always finding new and creative ways to link stuff together.

如果你用谷歌搜索这两个词，你会读到一大堆关于这个问题的博客文章。客户简介。因此，我前面提到的Zapier，通过为他们执行所有这些集成，他们帮助非技术人员使用API。特别酷的是，他们总是在寻找新的和有创意的方式把东西联系在一起。

The customers want to talk about themselves, and they do it over text.

客户想要谈论他们自己，而他们是通过文本来实现的。

Text interviews are a total cheat code for young companies, because they require way less production than video or audio, the internet really likes it for SEO, for scraping, and it makes the person look really smart. We've done some of these at YC, time over time the person wants to promote more than they do than when they see themselves in a video, and they feel weird. So, that's an easy thing to do.

对于年轻的公司来说，文本面试是一个完全的欺骗代码，因为他们需要的制作量比视频或音频少得多，互联网真的很喜欢它的搜索引擎优化，刮，它使人看起来真的很聪明。我们在YC做了一些这样的事情，随着时间的推移，这个人想要推销的比他们在视频中看到的要多，而且他们感觉很奇怪。所以，这是件容易的事。

Industry advice is another great one. So, Triplebyte helps companies hire engineers, Intercom is that little chat widget you've probably seen before, Des Traynor at Intercom writes about product and content marketing, those are great essays.

行业建议是另一个伟大的建议。所以，TripleByte帮助公司雇用工程师，而Intercom是你可能以前见过的一个小聊天工具，在Intercom上，des traynor写了关于产品和内容营销的文章，这些都是很棒的文章。

Triplebyte Hardge who used to be at YC writes about hiring engineers.

TripleByte Hardge曾在YC工作，他写过关于雇佣工程师的文章。

These are all great posts with the one caveat being that you have to really know what you're talking about or this just won't ring true. Next thing, tools. Front, this is a YC company, they made a website called Good Email Copy, or something like that where Matil just pulled together her favorite lines from emails, and then tagged things, so like, "Onboarding, we're shutting the company down." All kinds of fairly templated emails, and you can go on there and check them all out.

这些都是很好的帖子，但有一个警告，你必须真正知道你在说什么，否则这不会是真的。下一件事，工具。前面，这是一个YC公司，他们制作了一个名为“好邮件副本”的网站，或者类似的网站，马蒂尔从邮件中收集了她最喜欢的内容，然后标记了一些东西，所以，“入职，我们要关闭公司。” 所有类型的相当模板电子邮件，你可以去那里，并检查他们全部。

If you have extra engineering time, these can be super effective. Community. Both Hacker News and Product Hunt were built out from YC entities, but just getting good at engaging with your community on HN in Product Hunt is really undervalued.

如果你有额外的工程时间，这些可能是超级有效的。社区。黑客新闻和产品搜索都是从YC实体构建出来的，但仅仅是在产品搜索中擅长与你的社区HN进行合作却被低估了。

If you're someone who is known as a good actor on these sites, and engages with people, and is cool, that's worth your time. Not saying just lurk and comment on everything, but just know how it works, if that's where your customers are.

如果你是一个在这些网站上被认为是一个好演员的人，并且与人打交道，而且很酷，那么这是值得你花时间的。不是只说潜伏和评论每件事，而是知道它是如何工作的，如果这是你的客户所在的地方。

The last thing, and this is not exhaustive at all, but these are just some examples, publishing. So, Stripe is now making books. 37 Signals, Base Camp, they make books too.

最后一件事，这并不是详尽无遗的，但这些只是一些例子，出版。所以，Stripe现在正在做书。37信号，基地营，他们也做书。

This is super powerful in terms of your influencer status, but really, really hard to track. So, this would be later down the road, but it is effective, and because it's hard most people aren't gonna do it, so you can really stand out. So, that's it. Kat's gonna up to talk about press.

这在你的影响者地位方面是超级强大的，但真的，真的很难追踪。因此，这将是晚些时候，但它是有效的，因为它是困难的，大多数人不会这样做，所以你可以真正脱颖而出。就这样了。凯特要上来谈谈媒体的事。

Kat Manalac: All right, so let's jump back into press. So, why? As I mentioned it's not a scalable user acquisition, but it can get you some early adopting users, it can give you your investors, or potential employees a heads up that you exist, and it can help with SEO. A lot of people ask when do ... When should I start thinking about press? So, ideally you will have a sense that you're making something people want, as we said, so for most startups it's worth waiting to pitch until there's a call to action for your intended audience. So, is there a product that they can try, or buy, or something they can sign up for. Most companies who go through YC wait until they have a launched product and some very early users before they bother pitching to press.

好了，让我们回到媒体上吧。那么，为什么? 正如我提到的那样，这不是一个可扩展的用户获取，但它可以让你早期采用用户，它可以给你的投资者，或潜在的员工一个提示，你存在，它可以帮助搜索引擎优化。很多人问我什么时候。。。我什么时候开始考虑新闻? 所以，理想情况下，你会有这样一种感觉:你正在制造人们想要的东西，正如我们所说的那样，所以对于大多数初创公司来说，在为你的目标受众发出行动呼吁之前，你是值得等待的。那么，是否有他们可以尝试，购买的产品，或者他们可以注册的产品呢? 大多数通过YC的公司等到他们有了一个推出的产品和一些很早的用户之后，才费心去推销。

There are some exceptions.

有些例外。

There are companies that do press pre-product if there's something particularly novel about the ... Or notable about the company. This is especially true if you're working on a bio company, or something in the hard sciences that will take you a long time before you get to product, and there are other companies that wait years before they do press. One thing to note is that most media outlets don't cover very early stage startups anymore. You shouldn't waste their time with a non-story.

如果公司有什么特别新颖或引人注目的地方，就会有公司对产品进行预压。如果你在一家生物公司工作，或者在一些艰苦的科学领域工作，你需要很长时间才能开发出产品，而其他一些公司则要等上数年才能推出产品，这一点尤其如此。需要注意的一件事是，大多数媒体不再报道早期的初创公司。你不应该把他们的时间浪费在一个非故事上。

Think about what you're pitching objectively. Why should they care about this, and why now? That's one reason why a lot of startups will, the first time they pitch press will be to announce a fundraising round, because that's timely news, and that's why you see a lot of those fundraising announcements.

客观地想想你在投些什么。他们为什么要关心这个，为什么是现在? 这就是为什么很多初创公司会这么做的一个原因，他们第一次发布的消息是宣布一轮融资，因为这是及时的消息，这也是为什么你会看到很多的融资公告。

It's just an opportunity, a timely opportunity to pitch. We'll talk about ...

这只是一个机会，一个及时投球的机会。我们会讨论。。。

I'll go through a check list of things that you should prepare when you are pitching press, and the mechanics of how to do it, but first a quick word on PR firms. Don't hire them. At the stage that you're at PR firms are way too expensive.

我将会看一个清单，上面列出了你在推销时应该准备的东西，以及如何去做的技巧，但首先我要说一句关于公关公司的事情。别雇他们。在你在公关公司工作的阶段太贵了。

Typically you have to keep them on a monthly retainer, and most companies even through seeds Series A they don't have the budget for that. So, the thing is that your relationships that you build now with press will hopefully, it's similar to investors, last throughout the entire life cycle of your company, so you want to do that work early. You shouldn't bother thinking about hiring a firm or someone in house until you have more funding, and so much inbound that the founders can't deal with it themselves. One thing that PR people ... So, PR people, a lot of people think, "Oh, if I hire someone to do PR they'll magically think of all the most interesting stories that I can pitch." Well, that's not the case.

通常情况下,你必须每月保留他们,而大多数公司,即使是通过种子系列A,他们没有这方面的预算。所以,问题是,你现在和媒体建立的关系很有希望,和投资者相似,在公司的整个生命周期里都是这样,所以你想早点做这件事。在你有了更多的资金之前,你不应该考虑雇佣一家公司或公司内部的人,而且会有太多的资金流入,以至于创始人们自己也无法解决这个问题。公关人员.。所以,公关人员,很多人认为,“哦,如果我雇一个人来做公关,他们会神奇地想到所有我能做的最有趣的故事。”但事实并非如此。

The most interesting stories are gonna come from you, the founders. You know your company better than anyone else. So, what PR firms do have is connections to reporters, but you can build those yourself, and here's how we think about it. We treat PR like business development. So, like BD or sales, which you wouldn't outsource early in your company's life, you shouldn't outsource pitching to press in the very early stages of your company. As I said, these are relationships that you should build now, and will hopefully have for years to come. When you think about how to do this, we can talk about what you need to do to DIY your own PR essentially. So, we will walk through that now. A couple things that I recommend any company do is ...

最有趣的故事将来自你们,创始人。你比任何人都更了解你的公司。因此,公关公司所拥有的是与记者的联系,但你可以自己建立这些关系,下面是我们对此的看法。我们把公关当作业务发展。所以,就像BD或销售,你不会在公司生命的早期外包,你不应该在公司的早期阶段就把推销外包出去。就像我说过的,这些是你们现在应该建立的关系,希望在未来的几年里都能建立起来。当你思考如何做到这一点时,我们可以讨论你需要做些什么来做你自己的公关活动。所以,我们现在就走过去。我建议任何公司做的几件事就是.。

And people ask me, how much time should I be spending on this? Here's some recommended prep work.

人们问我,我应该花多少时间在这上面?以下是一些推荐的准备工作。

I think you can spend at least 30 minutes per week reading about the news in your industry. Keep a list of publications that cover your space, a list of media outlets that your users read, and a list of specific reporters who are interested in your vertical. If you don't know which outlets to track or to read talk to your users, and ask them what they read, and what they're interested in.

我认为你可以每周至少花30分钟阅读你所在行业的新闻。保存一份覆盖您空间的出版物列表,一份用户阅读的媒体机构列表,以及一份对您的垂直方向感兴趣的特定记者的列表。如果你不知道该追踪或阅读哪些渠道,就跟你的用户谈谈,问问他们读了什么,他们感兴趣的是什么。

Then I think that if you decide you want to try pitching to press, I think about it in three to six month increments of time. So, you can build a calendar. You can spend half an hour once a month thinking about what milestones are coming up that you're gonna hit, what announcements you might have, and map them out. So, here's an example using a start up school company in this batch.

然后我认为,如果你决定尝试跟媒体 pitch,我会在三到六个月的时间内考虑这个问题。所以,你可以建立一个日历。你可以每个月花半个小时思考你将要达到的里程碑,你可能会发布什么公告,并把它们规划出来。下面是一个例子,在这批中使用了一家初创学校公司。

They're called Orby. Orby is building flying robots that help retail with inventory tracking and surveillance. For example, in January assuming they raise a seed fund they might want to announce their seed fundraising with the intended audience of being engineers.

他们叫奥比。Orby正在制造飞行机器人,帮助零售进行库存跟踪和监视。例如,在1月份,假设他们筹集了一笔种子基金,他们可能会宣布他们的种子募捐计划,他们的目标受众是工程师。

Then in March, or example, they may want to pitch a trend data story targeted at CTO's that talks about how AI is lifting up brick and mortar retail sales. So, it's just good to do these brainstorming exercises similar to what Craig talked about in the content space for potential stories that you can pitch externally to press. Once you've decided you want to pitch a story, the first thing to do is to define your goals and your audience.

然后,在3月份,或者举个例子,他们可能想介绍一个针对首席技术官的趋势数据故事,讨论人工智能是如何提升实体零售额的。所以,做这些头脑风暴练习很好,就像克雷格在内容空间里所说的那样,你可以向外部推介潜在的故事。一旦你决定要讲一个故事,首先要做的就是确定你的目标和你的听众。

That will help you determine everything else. Who you want to pitch, the exact story you want to pitch, and how to measure its success. Once you know who your audience is you have to draft three things. A one sentence pitch, a three to five sentence pitch, and answers to frequently asked questions. So, questions that are frequently asked by reporters to early stage startup. Let's dig into each one of these things. A one sentence pitch should go over two things, what you're building, and who you're building it for. You should be able to say this in jargon free terms that anyone can understand and repeat. Here are a couple of examples of startup school companies who I think had pretty strong one sentence pitches coming in. So, Orby who I mentioned before, flying robots that help businesses monitor inventory and do surveillance.

这将帮助你决定其他一切。你想要向谁推销,你想要介绍的确切故事,以及如何衡量它的成功。一旦你知道你的听众是谁,你必须起草三件事。一个句子的音高,一个三到五个句子的音高,并回答常见的问题。所以,记者在创业初期经常问的问题。让我们把每一件事都挖掘出来。一个句子的音高应该包括两件事,你正在建造的东西,以及你为谁而建的东西。你应该能够用任何人都能理解和重复的术语自由地说出这一点。以下是几个创业学校公司的例子,我认为这些公司的一句话相当有力。所以,我之前提到的,飞行机器人,帮助企业监控库存和监视。

It's so clear and straight forward that I remembered it just off the top of my head when I was describing them earlier. You want anyone to be able to do that for your company.

这是如此清晰和直接，我记得它只是在我的头顶上，当我描述他们早些时候。你希望任何人都能为你的公司做到这一点。

The second one is another startup school company, The Box Company.

第二个是另一家初创学校公司，Box公司。

They're building smart eco friendly boxes for food delivery. So, you know what they're building, and who they're building it for. For both of these examples, and for probably all of your companies, a one sentence pitch isn't going to capture everything that you're doing, but you don't have to communicate that in a one sentence pitch. Just make it really clear and compelling enough that people followup with questions, and you want them to ask you questions that will let you give them more context. Next is the three sentence pitch. With a three to five sentence pitch you can give us that context, you can give us more of the story. You should talk not only about what your company does, and who the customer is, but why it's better than what's currently in the market. Also, if there's anything really notable about the founders, or the story, or the market, make sure to put that in there. Usually when we are pitching companies at YC, when we're pitching to press about their launches or fundraising, this is the pitch that we send to reporters. Let's go through two examples for Orby, and The Box Company. "Orby is building flying robots that help businesses monitor inventory, and do surveillance.

他们正在建造智能环保箱来运送食物。所以,你知道他们在建造什么,也知道他们是为谁建造的。对于这两个例子,或者对你所有的公司来说,一个句子的音高并不能捕捉到你正在做的所有事情,但是你不需要用一个句子的音高来表达这一点。只要让问题变得清晰和有说服力,人们就会跟进你的问题,你希望他们能问你一些问题,这样你就能给他们更多的背景。接下来是三个句子的音高。有了三到五个句子,你可以给我们这个背景,你可以给我们更多的故事。你不仅应该谈谈你的公司做什么,谁是客户,而且为什么它比现在的市场更好。此外,如果有什么真正值得注意的创始人,或故事,或市场,确保把它放在那里。通常,当我们在YC推销公司时,当我们推介他们的发布会或筹款时,这就是我们发送给记者的宣传。让我们来看看Orby和Box公司的两个例子。Orby正在制造飞行机器人,帮助企业监控库存,并进行监视。

The robots were designed with safety in mind, and are outfitted with lightweight vision sensors that let them navigate autonomously alongside retail or warehouse employees. Orby can save employees hours of manual work per shift so they can spend more time doing things that matter, like serving and helping customers. The company's currently in pilot talks with major U.S. Retailers." So, we covered what they do, who they're building it for, and why they're better than what's currently in the market. When I talked to the Orby founders they said what makes us special is these are very lightweight, and they're very safe so that they can fly around indoors, alongside humans and really help them. We also tease the fact that they are in talks with big retailers, so that's something that might pique someones interest, or a reporters interest. Second is The Box Company. "They are building smart eco friendly boxes for food delivery.", and then you can talk a little bit about the market. "The food delivery market is on the rise.

这些机器人的设计考虑到了安全性,并配备了轻量级视觉传感器,让它们能够与零售或仓库员工一起自主导航。Orby可以节省每班员工的手工工作时间,这样他们就可以花更多的时间去做重要的事情,比如服务和帮助客户。该公司目前正在与美国主要零售商进行试点谈判。“因此,我们讨论了他们所做的,他们为谁而建的,以及为什么他们比目前的市场更好。当我和Orby的创始人交谈时,他们说,让我们与众不同的是,它们非常轻巧,而且非常安全,这样它们就可以在室内飞行,与人类一起飞行,并能真正帮助它们。我们还戏弄他们正在与大型零售商谈判,所以这可能会激起一些人的兴趣,或者引起记者的兴趣。第二个是盒子公司。“他们正在建造智能环保箱来运送食物。”然后你就可以谈谈市场了。他说:“食物供应市场正在上升。

It's predicted to grow 79% by 2020.", and then you can talk about the problem, "but it's still difficult to order food, to order delivery and get the same quality you would get in a restaurant. Additionally, packaging is often non-recyclable, and non-compostable which creates an enormous waste problem." Then you talk about their solution. "The Box Company is solving these issues with a patented box that improves the entire delivery process." Then you can talk a little bit about the units, that "they're stackable, easy to assemble, they solve the soggy, sloppy food problem，" and then if you have specific ... So, say they have a customer they might want to put that in. Talk a little bit about their progress, but here again, you have a little bit more context, you can show how big of a problem it is, and how they're solving it. So now you have this.

到2020年，它将增长79%。“，然后你可以谈论这个问题，”但仍然很难订购食物，订购送货单和获得餐馆里的同样质量。此外，包装通常是不可循环再用的，也是不可循环再用的，这造成了巨大的浪费问题。“ 然后你再谈谈他们的解决方案。Box公司正在用一个专利的Box解决这些问题，它改进了整个交付过程。“ 然后你可以谈一谈这些部件，“它们是可堆叠的，易于组装的，它们解决了潮湿，邋遢的食物问题”，然后如果你有具体的。。。所以，说他们有一个顾客，他们可能想把它放进去。说说他们的进步，但是在这里，你有一些更多的上下文，你可以展示一个问题有多大，以及他们是如何解决的。现在你有了这个。

I think it's best for you and your co-founders to draft the answers to frequently asked questions that reporters ask.

我认为你和你的联合创始人最好起草一份关于记者经常问到的问题的答案。

I talked to many reporters, and one of them sent me this list, and while she was at ... Laura Kolodny, while she was at the Wall Street Journal she said, "These are the questions that I ask all early stage startups and expect them to know how to answer." I won't go through every single one of these now, but you can take a photo of it, or reference it later.

我和许多记者谈过，其中一个给我发了这份名单，当她在。。。劳拉·科洛德尼，当她在“华尔街日报”工作时，她说:“这是我问所有初创公司的问题，希望他们知道如何回答。” 我现在不想每一个都看，但是你可以拍一张照片，或者以后再看。

These are ...

这些是。。。

It's best to draft really succinct answers to these. One piece of advice I have is that it's great to practice.

最好起草一份非常简洁的答案。我有一个建议，那就是练习是很棒的。

It's great to practice your succinct answers, but I wouldn't over-rehearse, because you don't want to sound like a marketing robot with everything memorized, you don't want to have these memorized answers that you use in every context.

练习简洁的答案是很棒的，但是我不会排练太多，因为你不想听起来像一个营销机器人，所有的东西都被记住了，你不想在每一个上下文中都用到这些被记住的答案。

What I typically tell founders to do is have answers to all those questions, then what I recommend doing before talking to press is bullet pointing the three to five points that you want to make sure to talk about in an interview, and then let the rest of the answers to questions flow organically.

我通常会告诉创业者对所有这些问题都有答案，然后我建议他们在与媒体对话之前先指出你想要在面试中讨论的三到五个问题，然后让其他问题的答案有机地流动起来。

It's good to practice, but don't over-rehearse. Let's talk now about how to pitch to press, what the mechanics are. Now that you've done this prep work, now that you're ready, I will dig into each one of these. So, picking your moment.

练习是好的，但是不要排练太多。现在让我们来谈谈如何投球压，什么是机械。既然你已经做了这些准备工作，现在你已经准备好了，我会深入研究每一个。所以，选择你的时刻。

The big question is, why now? Tech Crunch back when they first started covered pretty much every single company that launched because there were like, one startup every two weeks would launch in the early 2000s, but now they get 10's if not 100's of pitches per day. So, you have to think about what's your news hook? If you have news like a fundraising round that sort of makes it easy, or if you can show that you're part of a trend or a current news story that might be what makes it easier for you to get a response. The example for Orby, they can say, "Orby, we're a flying robot company, and we're giving brick and mortar retails a fighting chance against Amazon." So, everyone's talking about it's all retail against Amazon these days, so if you can plug yourself into a trend piece like that, that makes it easier. Another thing to think about around timing is that if there's a big news event happening that week, don't pitch your story. So, if you're reaching out to Tech Crunch during Tech Crunch disrupt you'd be crazy lucky to get a response from them, or if you're pitching a report who covers Apple, don't hit them up during WWDC. Your chances of getting a response decrease immensely. So now after you are picking your moment, you have your news hook, you know what you want to pitch, you can pick your target.

最大的问题是，为什么是现在? Tech Crunch最初成立时几乎覆盖了每一个刚刚成立的公司，因为每两周就有一个初创公司会在本世纪初上市，但现在他们每天都能得到10个，如果不是100个的话。所以，你得想想你的新闻是什么? 如果你有类似这样的筹款活动的新闻，那就容易了，或者你可以证明你是潮流的一部分，或者是一个最新的新闻，这可能会让你更容易得到回应。奥比的例子，他们可以说，“奥比，我们是一个飞行机器人公司，我们给砖头和迫击炮零售商一个与亚马逊战斗的机会。” 所以，现在每个人都在谈论它是零售对亚马逊，所以如果你能插入到一个潮流的一部分，这样做更容易。另一件需要考虑的事情是，如果在那个星期发生了一个重大新闻事件，不要把你的故事。所以，如果你在技术危机爆发时接触到技术危机，你将会非常幸运地得到他们的回应，或者，如果你在发布一个报道苹果的报告，不要在WWDC期间上。你得到回应的机会大大减少了。所以现在当你选择了你的时刻，你有了你的新闻挂钩，你知道你想投什么，你可以选择你的目标。

This is easy because you think who is your audience, what are my goals, think about what they read.

这很简单，因为你认为谁是你的观众，我的目标是什么，想想他们读什么。

I would stack rank a list of your top three choices. So, have ...

我会把你的前三个选择排在第一位。所以，有。。。

These are the three publications that I would most like to cover my news. Be realistic. Realistically the New York Times isn't going to cover a newly born company, as much as I would love them to.

这是我最想报道新闻的三种出版物。现实点。实际上，“纽约时报”不会像我所希望的那样报道一个刚刚诞生的公司。

I would look at who is actually covering startups at your stage and in your vertical, and add those as your first three choices.

我会看看谁在你的舞台上，在你的垂直线上真正地覆盖了初创公司，并将它们作为你的前三个选择。

Then, basically I would recommend giving an exclusive to your first choice. An exclusive is when you pitch your story to just one reporter, and if they agree to pick it up you don't give anyone else a briefing, or a heads up until that reporter publishes their story. A lot of people ask why an exclusive versus giving a lot of different reporters a heads up on the news. So, the reason is, a reporter is more likely to pick up your story and write it if they can get an exclusive, if they can break the news, if they can get that scoop. So, I recommend offering that one publication an exclusive, and once you're a bigger company, and more of a household name, or you're bigger, let's say fundraising Series A+ news, or huge hires, then you can think more about briefing multiple reporters at once, but early stage for the vast majority of YC companies, and anyone pre YC I always recommend exclusives first. So, now that you know who your target is, that you want to offer them an exclusive, how do you get in touch with that reporter? The best way to get in touch with reporters is through warm introductions, just like business development.

然后,基本上,我建议给你的第一选择独家。独家新闻是指你只向一名记者推介你的报道,如果他们同意把它捡起来,你就不会给其他人做简报,或者在那个记者发表他们的报道之前给他提个醒。很多人问,为什么独家新闻和新闻报道给了很多不同的记者一个提示。所以,原因是,一个记者更有可能拿起你的故事,写如果他们能得到独家,如果他们能打破新闻,如果他们能得到那个独家新闻。所以,我建议提供一份独家出版物,一旦你成为了一家更大的公司,更多的家喻户晓的名字,或者你更大,比如说筹资系列A+新闻,或者是大量的员工,那么你可以考虑一次向多名记者做更多的简报,但是对于绝大多数YC公司来说,在早期阶段,我总是首先推荐任何在YC之前的人。那么,既然你知道你的目标是谁,你想为他们提供独家报道,你如何与那个记者取得联系?与记者联系的最好方法是通过热情的介绍,就像业务发展一样。

The best way to get an answer from someone is to get a personal introduction to that reporter. Cold emailing will get you, maybe if you're lucky, a one in 10 response, and warm introductions will get at least half the time you'll get someone to respond to you.

要从别人那里得到答案，最好的方法就是给那个记者做个个人介绍。冷邮件会让你得到，如果你幸运的话，十个回复中就有一个，而热情的介绍至少有一半的时间会让别人对你作出回应。

What I would do is create that stack rank list, here are the top three choices, reporters you'd want to reach out to.

我要做的是创建一个堆栈列表，下面是三个前三个选项，你想要联系的记者。

If I were Orby, for example, I might want to hit up Laura Kolodny at CNBC, she covers drones and flying industrial robots.

举个例子，如果我是奥比，我可能会去CNBC找劳拉·科洛尼，她负责无人机和飞行工业机器人。

I would then ask my network, everyone I know on Facebook, any other founders I knew, would you be willing to ... Does anyone know Laura? Has she covered anyone in my network? Would you be willing to give me a warm introduction? I see founders often ask each other for warm introductions to press, and so that's for them, the easiest way, and often. Assuming you find that person to give you an intro make it as easy as possible for them to introduce you. I would draft the email for them.

然后我会问我的网络，我在Facebook认识的每个人，我认识的其他创始人，你愿意。。。有人认识劳拉吗? 她在我的网络里报道过什么人吗? 你愿意给我一个热情的介绍吗? 我看到创始人经常向对方要热情的介绍，所以对他们来说，这是最简单的方式，也是最经常的方式。假设你找到那个给你介绍的人，让他们尽可能简单地介绍你。我会为他们起草电子邮件。

This is what a draft email might look like.

这就是草稿邮件的样子。

They should be no longer than this. Anything longer than two short paragraphs, a reporter, anyone really, their eyes will glaze over. Draft that warm intro email for your friend, and hopefully you have a better chance of getting a response from that reporter. Finally, I would say give it time.

他们不应该再这样了。任何超过两小段的文字，一个记者，真的任何人，他们的眼睛都会变得呆滞。给你的朋友写一封热情的介绍邮件，希望你有更好的机会得到那个记者的回复。最后，我要说给它时间。

I often get requests from founders saying, "Oh, can you help me out? I need this to be done tomorrow.

我经常接到创始人的请求说:“哦，你能帮我吗?我需要明天再做这件事。”

I want to launch on Wednesday." That just isn't going to happen.

我想在星期三发射。“那是不可能的。

Ideally work your way back. Say, you want to announce something two or three weeks from now. Give it at the very least two weeks for the whole process of warm introductions, then making ... Meeting with that reporter, and then having the piece come out.

理想的工作方式回来。你想在两三个星期后宣布些什么。给它至少两个星期的整个过程的热情介绍，然后使。。。会议的记者，然后有文章出来。

Two weeks is the absolutely minimum time I would give it.

两周绝对是我给的最短时间。

And then ...

后来。。。

What things ...

什么东西。。。

What not to do once you are in touch with a reporter, and some of these sound pretty obvious, and I don't believe any of you would ever do these things. One is, don't lie. Don't fudge your numbers. Don't say you can do things that you can't. We've seen some very public instances in the press of things like that happening.

一旦你和一个记者取得联系，什么是不该做的，其中一些听起来很明显，我不相信你们中的任何一个人会做这些事情。一个是，别撒谎。别把你的号码搞混了。不要说你能做你不能做的事。我们在媒体上看到了一些非常公开的事件，像这样的事情正在发生。

Those stories will always come back and haunt you.

那些故事总是会回来缠着你。

I've seen it time and again. Second, don't act like you're entitled to a story.

我看过一遍又一遍。第二，别装得好像你有权听故事似的。

If you get in touch with a reporter feel free to followup if they go silent, followup once or twice very politely, but don't ...

如果你和一个记者取得联系，如果他们沉默了，你可以随时跟进，很有礼貌地跟进一两次，但不要。。。

I've seem some founders who followup every single day for weeks, and it's just ...

我好像有些创始人几周来每天都在跟进，只是。。。

That's crazy. Don't do that, because then that reporter will write you off, and you won't have that relationship long term. Don't suggest headlines, or copy.

太疯狂了。不要那样做，因为那样那个记者就会把你甩了，你就不会有那种长期的关系了。不要提出标题或副本。

This is the reporters job to do, and they see it ...

这是记者的工作，他们看到了。。。

I've seen people get offended by founders suggesting specific headlines. Don't ask to see a draft. We've worked with a lot of folks that come from the life sciences, and bio and they're surprised by this one, because they're used to peer review journals, but the thing is, reporters get incredibly offended.

我见过一些人因为创始人提出了特定的标题而感到生气。不要要求看草稿。我们和许多来自生命科学和生物学科的人合作过，他们对此感到惊讶，因为他们习惯了同行评议期刊，但事实是，记者们会非常生气。

They think you're questioning their journalistic integrity if you ask to see what they're writing before they publish it. So, don't ask to see a draft.

如果你问他们在出版之前写了什么，他们会认为你是在质疑他们的新闻诚信。所以，不要要求看草稿。

I mean, there are certain cases where sometimes they need to fact check something so they'll show you something ahead of time, but let them make that ask of you. Finally, as I mentioned, don't speak like a marketing robot, just talk like a human, know your numbers, know the answers to the questions, but don't worry about having everything super memorized, and so if everything goes well, and you have a piece that is published, as Craig says don't be lazy, take the time to promote it. You have social media channels, promote it on all your own channels, and if you have an email list of investors, or friends, shoot them a note saying, "Hey, good news, we were in Tech Crunch.", and I would draft a Tweet for them. When folks draft Tweets for me to send out I'm much more likely to just copy and paste and help them promote it. Promote the story, don't be afraid to ask friends and family, put it on all the socials, and then plan B, if it turns out no one wants to run your story, it's not a big deal.

我的意思是，在某些情况下，有时他们需要实际检查一些东西，这样他们就会提前给你看一些东西，但是让他们问你。最后，正如我提到的，不要像营销机器人一样说话，像人一样说话，知道你的数字，知道问题的答案，但不要担心所有的东西都被超级记忆，所以如果一切都进行得很好，你就有一篇发表的文章，就像克雷格说的那样，不要偷懒，花时间去宣传它。你有社交媒体频道，在所有你自己的频道上进行宣传，如果你有一个投资者或朋友的邮件列表，就给他们发一张便条，告诉他们:“嘿，好消息，我们处于科技危机中。”我会为他们起草一条推特。当人们起草推特给我发送，我更有可能只是复制和粘贴，并帮助他们推广它。宣传故事，不要害怕问朋友和家人，把它放在所有的社会，然后计划B，如果没有人想要运行你的故事，这不是一个大问题。

It's not gonna make or break you, so post it on your own channels, and put it through the whole content process.

它不会影响到你，所以把它发布到你自己的频道上，然后把它放到整个内容过程中去。

I think it's a reasonably good practice to do that, and then think about after you go through this whole process, was it worth it? Did it help ... Did the piece that came out in Tech Crunch, or Wall Street journal, or Bloomberg, actually help you achieve the goal that you set for it? Did you get new users on your platform? Did you get potential investors inbound? Did it actually help you achieve what you set out to achieve? So, that is the entire process, and we'll just open it up to Q&A if anyone has any questions. Craig, you want to come back up here? All right, yeah.

我认为这是一个相当好的做法，然后在你经历了整个过程后再想想，这值得吗? 它是否有助于。。。。。。。。。“科技危机”，“华尔街日报”，或彭博社的那篇文章，真的能帮助你实现你为它设定的目标吗? 你的平台上有新用户吗? 你吸引到潜在投资者了吗? 它真的能帮助你实现你想要达到的目标吗? 所以，这就是整个过程，如果有人有任何问题，我们将直接向Q&A提出。克雷格，你想回到这里来吗? 好吧，是的。

Male 1: If journalists are already reaching out to you, and you don't really have a product market [fit] and you're really focused on product at the moment, should we spend any time engaging with them, or should you just focus on the product market fit of it?

男1:如果记者已经开始接触你，而你还没有真正的产品市场，你现在真的很专注于产品，我们是否应该花时间与他们接触，或者你是否应该专注于产品市场的适合性呢?(男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:男1:如果记者已经开始接触你的产品市场。

Kat Manalac: So, the question, if journalists are proactively reaching out to you and are interested in writing about, but you don't have ... You're really early, and don't have product market fit, what can you ... Should you spend any time engaging them? You know frankly, I ...

那么，问题是，如果记者主动接触你，对写作感兴趣，但你没有……你真的很早，没有产品市场适合，你能……你应该花点时间去吸引他们吗? 老实说，我。。。

It can ...

它可以。。。

It does help to have that relationship, and if there's a way you can be helpful, you're like ... Reasonably quickly, "Oh you have a question about this vertical, or this industry, I'm happy to answer, but I wouldn't then spend a huge amount of time pitching your story, but just say, "I'd love to keep you posted on our progress.", and then check in with them regularly, or when you have news, but I think it is good to be helpful early on.

有这种关系确实会有帮助，如果你能帮上忙的话，你会说。。。很快，“哦，你有一个关于垂直的问题，或者这个行业的问题，我很乐意回答，但是我不会花大量的时间来讲述你的故事，只是说，”我很乐意让你了解我们的进展。“然后定期和他们联系，或者当你有消息的时候，我认为这是个好消息。

Male 2: If your first content marketing approach is [inaudible] blog, would you recommend for anything as a personal blog, or as a [inaudible] link to your company product, or would you straight up [inaudible] ?

男性2:如果你的第一个内容营销方法是[听不见]博客，你会推荐任何个人博客，还是公司产品的[听不见]链接，或者你会直接[听不见]?

Craig Cannon: Well, what are you gonna write about?

克雷格·坎农:那么，你打算写些什么呢?

Kat Manalac: Repeat the question.

重复这个问题。

Craig Cannon: Oh, right yeah sorry.

克雷格·坎农:哦，是的，抱歉。

If you are just starting out in content marketing, you're debating whether to do a personal blog or a company blog. My question to you would be, are you writing just about company stuff?

如果你刚刚开始做内容营销，你是在讨论是做个人博客还是公司博客。我的问题是，你是在写公司的东西吗?

Male 2: Well, I would be targeting [inaudible] long, target software engineers [inaudible] .

男2:嗯，我的目标是长时间的，目标是软件工程师。

Craig Cannon: Okay, so one thing that's really effective, is doing it like "title of blog, by so and so." You see this with a lot of podcasts, it's like whatever the podcast name ...

CraigCannon:好吧，所以有一件事真的很有效，那就是像“博客的标题，等等。” 你看很多播客，就像播客的名字。。。

I mean, Joe Rogan is a good example, but that's not a company thing. People connect with other humans so having that little extra touch is nice, but I would say overall you're gonna want it on your own site for SEO. Yeah, I kinda disagree with people putting stuff on medium and stuff early on.

我是说，乔·罗根就是一个很好的例子，但那不是公司的事情。人们与其他人的联系，所以有一点额外的接触是很好的，但我会说，总的来说，你会希望它在你自己的网站搜索引擎优化。是的，我有点不同意人们把东西放在中等和东西的早期。

Kat Manalac: Yeah, I've seen it works really well when you have a company blog like Stripe has their company blog, but then they have specific authors for each blog post, and people really like connecting with that human.

KatManalac:是的，当你有一个像Stripe这样的公司博客的时候，我看到它真的很好用，但是他们每一篇博客都有自己的作者，而且人们真的很喜欢和那个人联系。

Male 3: How do you feel about working with influencers who don't necessarily, or don't have a need for your product at the time. Our company is based around moving, so if an influencer is not currently moving, how would you feel about working with them to promote your company?

男3:和那些不一定需要你的产品，或者不需要你的产品的有影响力的人一起工作，你有什么感觉? 我们的公司是围绕着移动的，所以如果一个影响者目前没有移动，你会如何看待与他们合作来提升你的公司?

Kat Manalac: The question is how do you feel about working with influencers who don't need your product at the time? I haven't seen cases like that that have worked out really well, especially for each stage, and I think a big problem is that influencers often charge you, and are expensive.

问题是你对和那些不需要你的产品的有影响力的人合作有什么感觉? 我还没见过这样的例子，特别是对于每个阶段，效果都很好，我认为一个大问题是，影响者经常向你收费，而且很贵。

If you get some huge influencer who just loves what you're doing and wants to Tweet about you, and that's great, but more often than not they're gonna charge you, and it's not worth ...

如果你有一个很有影响力的人，他喜欢你做的事情，并且想要对你发微博，这很好，但通常他们会向你收费，而且这不值得。。。

The conversion's not gonna be worth it, especially if they're just generally talking about you versus answering a real need for themselves.

这种转变是不值得的，尤其是如果他们只是在谈论你，而不是满足他们自己的真正需求的话。

Craig Cannon: But this is totally something you can test, kinda like what Kat's saying, I wouldn't bet the farm on something like this, be like, "Oh man, for $100,000 we can get in on this thing." I would skip that, but I mean, at scale it ends up working.

CraigCannon:但这完全是你可以测试的，就像Kat说的那样，我不会把农场赌在这种东西上，就像，“哦，伙计，花10万美元我们就能在这东西上赚到钱。” 我会跳过的，但我的意思是，在规模它最终工作。

I heard Casey Neistat, this vlogger, is responsible for an insane amount of Boosted Board sales, and I'm pretty sure they don't pay him anything. So, it does work.

我听说凯西·内斯达，这个VLOGER，对董事会销售额的疯狂增长负有责任，我很确定他们不会付给他任何报酬。所以，确实有用。

Kat Manalac: I've seen folks often ... Folks with hardware, like physical product, will send samples or demo pieces to press or influencers, and that's sometimes enough. Like, Casey Neistat loves Boosted Boards so he organically talks about it, and that's great, but having to pay those influencers is not usually worth it early on.

KatManalac:我经常看到人们。。。有硬件的人，比如物理产品，会发送样品或演示件给记者或影响者，这有时已经足够了。就像凯西·内斯塔特喜欢被提升的董事会，所以他很自然地谈论了这件事，这很好，但要支付那些有影响力的人通常不值得在早期就这么做。

Woman 1: With the three to five sentence examples that you gave for Orby, and the other company, how much of that is what they're actually doing today versus what they want to be growing toward? Somewhere in that fuzzy line between promotion and lying ... How do you draw that balance?

女人1:你给Orby和其他公司举了三到五个句子的例子，有多少是他们今天实际在做的，而不是他们想要成长的? 在升职和撒谎之间的模糊界线里。。。你是怎么平衡的?

Kat Manalac: So, the question is, with the three to five sentence example how much of it is vision for the future, and what they hope to do, versus what they're doing today? I think it's ...

那么，问题是，用三到五句话的例子来说，这在多大程度上是对未来的愿景，以及他们希望做什么，与他们现在正在做什么? 我想是。。。

I think you can sort of ...

我觉得你可以。。。

There is a fine line, as you said, I think it's possible to communicate both, you can say this is the vision, and today they're doing X, and so for Orby, in Orby's case I think they have prototypes they have pieces that can do that theoretically, but they ... Or at this point when they would be pitching, but they can add a line in there about if there is a bigger vision for the company that they hope to achieve, you can definitely drop it in there, but I think it's best for people to know where you're at right now.

有一条细线, 正如你所说的，我认为这两者都是可能的，你可以说这是一个愿景，而今天他们正在做X，所以在Orby的例子中，我认为他们有一些原型，可以从理论上做到这一点，但是他们。。。或者在现在他们要推销的时候，他们可以在那里增加一条线，如果他们希望实现的公司有一个更大的愿景的话，你肯定会认为他们在那里。

Male 4: This one's for Craig, I think the click bait versus authenticity, so that example of Elon Musk is great, because the headline was Elon Musk Smokes Weed, that was really awesome stuff in their podcast, and it was authentic, but how do you ... We've got a lot of great content that's really expert level, and we're at that level of what ... Do we want to do some catchy titles, 'cause that's gonna bringing in the audience.

男4:这是给克雷格的，我认为点击诱饵和真实性，所以埃隆麝香的例子很棒，因为标题是埃隆麝香吸大麻，那在他们的播客中是非常棒的东西，而且是真实的，但是你怎么。。。我们有很多很棒的内容，是真正的专家级的，我们在这个层次。。。。我们想做些什么。。。。。我们想要做一些很有吸引力的标题，因为观众会带来一些。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。

What's your view on this? How do you ... How should we balance this, because you can't get the order if you don't have some sort of headline?

你对此有何看法? 你怎么。。。我们怎么平衡这个，因为如果你没有某种标题，你就得不到订单?

Craig Cannon: I would say ... So, the question is like, make click bait, the assumption is we have good content, we're not getting a lot of traffic, we're debating whether to title it something straight, or give it some click bait headline to hopefully get people in, right?

克雷格:我想说……所以，问题是，点击诱饵，假设我们有很好的内容，我们不会有太多的流量，我们正在讨论是直接给它命名，还是给它一些点击诱饵标题，希望让人们进入，对吗?

Male 4: Right.

对。

Craig Cannon: So, I'm generally not for that.

克雷格·坎农:所以，我一般不赞成。

The thing that bothers me more than click bait headlines, are really shitty stock photos.

比点击诱饵标题更让我烦恼的是，这些照片真的很烂。

I think that's a red flag more than anything on a blog, so definitely skip those.

我认为这是一个红旗比任何在博客上，所以绝对跳过这些。

This is something you can test, but back to that Zapier point, if you know where your customers are, and know what they really want, you should be able to title it in a way that will get them to respond.

这是你可以测试的东西，但是回到Zapier的观点，如果你知道你的客户在哪里，并且知道他们真正想要什么，你应该能够以一种能让他们做出反应的方式来命名它。

If you're going for giant mass appeal, you might have to do that, but I've never had success doing click bait stuff, and getting good results.

如果你想要巨大的群众呼吁，你可能必须这样做，但我从来没有成功的点击诱饵的东西，并取得良好的结果。

Male 4: The Onion?

The Onion?

Craig Cannon: The Onion, yeah-

克雷格·坎农:The Onion，是的-

Kat Manalac: Depends on what the product is.

KatManalac:取决于产品是什么。

Craig Cannon: That's the objective right? It's not click bait, technically-

克雷格·坎农:这就是目标，对吗? 不是点击诱饵，技术上来说-

Male 4: Well, it's ... Yeah, I know, it's ... Yeah.

嗯，是……是的，我知道，是……是的。

Craig Cannon: If the question is, should you make a good headline or a shitty headline? You should make a good headline.

CraigCannon:如果问题是，你应该做一个好的标题还是一个糟糕的标题? 你应该做个好标题。

Male 5: Hi, during the product marketing fit, the early stage, how often should the founders publish content? Every week? Every two weeks?

男5:嗨，在产品营销合适的早期阶段，创始人应该多久发布一次内容? 每星期? 每两周?

Kat Manalac: How often should founders publish content during the phase where you're trying to hit product market fit still?

KatManalac:在你试图进入产品市场的阶段，创始人应该多久发布一次内容?

Craig Cannon: Before product market fit.

CraigCannon:在产品上市前。

Kat Manalac: But prior to it.

但是在那之前。

Male 5: During that stage, that [inaudible] stage basically, you are talking to your customers, [inaudible] something?

男性5:在那个阶段，那个(听不见的)阶段，基本上，你是在和你的顾客说话，(听不见的)什么?

Kat Manalac: That's tough, I mean, as you were saying it does take time to create good content, so I don't want to say you should do something every week, because then that's putting that might be unrealistic for a team of two, but-

马纳拉克:这很难，我的意思是，正如你所说的，创造好的内容确实需要时间，所以我不想说你应该每周都做些什么，因为这对两个人的球队来说是不现实的，但是-

Craig Cannon: I mean, I would say if you could make something actually good every month, you're doing great.

克雷格·坎农:我的意思是，如果你每个月都能做些真正好的事情，你会做得很好。

Kat Manalac: Yeah, and I mean, I think a lot of ...

是的，我的意思是，我想很多。。。

It takes companies a good amount of time to really find product market fits. You can start earlier than ... prior to hitting product market fit.

要想真正找到适合产品市场的产品，公司需要花费大量的时间。你可以比。。。在进入产品市场之前更早开始。

Craig Cannon: Yeah, it's ... Just to keep going, it's all relative to also the amount of value that you give with the piece. A lot of these decks, like the Mary Meeker deck, that happens once a year, and then tons of people, like millions of people will download this thing, but if you're gonna just write a four paragraph blog post, you probably have to publish a little bit more frequently.

克雷格·坎农:是的,是.为了继续前进,这一切都是相对于你给出的价值。很多这样的甲板,比如Mary Meeker,每年都会发生一次,然后成千上万的人,像数以百万计的人会下载这个东西,但是如果你只写一篇四段的博客文章,你可能需要更频繁地发表。

Male 6: [inaudible] , if you don't have product market fit should you just not write content unless it's [inaudible] ?

男性6:(听不到)，如果你没有产品市场适合，你是否应该只写内容，除非它是[听不到]?

Craig Cannon: Oh, yeah ... So, if you don't have product market fit should you not write anything? I mean, it can be helpful to build your own brand, but I think yeah, in general, like I said in the talk, you're just funneling traffic towards something that's not gonna convert.

克雷格·坎农:哦，是的……所以，如果你没有适合的产品市场，你应该什么都不写吗? 我的意思是，建立你自己的品牌是有帮助的，但我认为是的，一般来说，就像我在谈话中说的那样，你只是在为一些不会改变的东西而转移交通。

Male 7: I was wondering, can you go over some of the dangers of celebrity endorsements and star powers, basically if you've got somebody that's really gung ho about boosting your product, and they have a huge audience, what are things you should avoid with that?

男7:我在想，你能回顾一下名人代言和明星影响力的一些危险吗?基本上，如果你有一个真正热衷于推销你的产品的人，而且他们有大量的观众，那么你应该避免什么呢?

Kat Manalac: So, the question is, if you have a celebrity that's really gung ho about your product, and wants to boost and talk about it, what are the potential downsides? You know, if the alt right or something decides they want ... You know, that's happened, right, so it's like, I mean there are definite downsides, I don't think that ... it's not something I would worry too much about.

那么，问题是，如果你有一个名人真的很关注你的产品，想要提高和谈论它，有什么潜在的不利因素? 你知道，如果错了或者什么事情决定了他们想要。。。你知道，这已经发生了，对，所以我是说，我的意思是，我不认为。。。。。。。这是一件我不会太担心的事情。。。。。。。。。我是说，我的意思是，我的意思是，我的意思是。。。。。。我不会太担心。。。。。。。。。

I think the vast majority of companies don't have this problem.

我认为绝大多数公司没有这个问题。

I mean, it's sort of like ... But yeah, I think ... He's like, in general it's a good problem if you have people who are so excited about what you're building.

我是说，这有点像。。。但是，我认为。。。他说，一般来说，如果你的人对你正在建设的东西感到兴奋的话，这是个好问题。

I mean, if in the case of, I think it was New Balance or something where the alt right was like, "We love New Balance.", New Balance had to come out and say, "We don't endorse what they're saying." So, I think ... But this is such an uncommon problem that I don't think you have to worry about it early on.

我的意思是，如果在这种情况下，我认为这是一种新的平衡，或者类似于“我们喜欢新的平衡”这样的东西，新的平衡必须出来说，“我们不赞同他们所说的。” 所以，我想。。。但这是一个不常见的问题，我不认为你需要担心它的早期。

Male 7: So it's more like if there's a catastrophe just exploit the PR out of it?

男性7:所以更像是如果有一个灾难，仅仅是利用公关出来的?

Kat Manalac: Yeah, I mean, it's like, if there's a catastrophe then have ...

是的，我是说，就像，如果发生了灾难。。。

I would say your founding team should be ready with a response for that, and get out there.

我要说，你们的创始团队应该做好准备，对此作出反应，然后离开那里。

Craig Cannon: And also, I agree 100% with Kat, but if you're getting a celebrity on board just because they are inflammatory, like if you thought Alex Jones was the best representation of your brand, and you weren't prepared for the shit show that was gonna come, that's kind of on you.

克雷格·坎农:而且，我100%同意凯特的观点，但是如果你仅仅因为一个名人具有煽动性，比如你认为亚历克斯·琼斯是你品牌中最好的代表，而你又没有做好准备迎接即将到来的“狗屎秀”，那就有点怪你了。

Kat Manalac: Yes.

是的。

Male 8: [inaudible] ... Just curious, I mean, how often should we send updates, or should we send updates to the press if we have their contacts or and they have reached out, should we regularly communicate on the developments on the product?

男8:(听不到)。。。。。。。只是好奇，我的意思是，我们应该多久发送一次更新，或者我们应该发送更新给媒体，如果我们有他们的联系人或他们已经接触，我们是否应该定期交流产品的开发情况?

Kat Manalac: Typically ... For the vast majority, once ... Sorry, oh yes. Repeating the question, how often should you send updates to reporters about your product and the progress that you're making? So, I would say that they don't generally want to hear every update you have about your product, or that kind of progress.

通常。。。对绝大多数人来说，曾经。。。抱歉，哦，是的。重复这个问题，你应该多久向记者发送一次关于你的产品和你正在取得的进展的更新信息? 所以，我会说，他们通常不想听到你的产品的每一个更新，或那种进展。

If you have news they certainly want to hear that.

如果你有消息，他们肯定想听。

If there's something you want to announce, and even ...

如果你有什么要宣布的，甚至。。。

I would give them the chance to say no, that they're not interested.

我会给他们机会说不，他们不感兴趣。

It's worth it if you have news reaching out.

如果你能联系到新闻，这是值得的。

There are some cases where for example YC at this point because we've been around a while, a lot of reporters ask to be added to our email list, or a press list, and in those cases you can send things out more regularly, but I wouldn't blast reporters every month with your company updates.

有些情况下,比如YC,因为我们已经有一段时间了,很多记者要求我们的电子邮件列表,或者新闻列表,在这些情况下,你可以更有规律地发送东西,但是我不会每个月在你的公司更新的情况下对记者进行轰炸。

Geoff Ralston: Okay you guys we'll take 1 more question.

杰夫·罗尔斯顿:好的，你们两位，我们再问一个问题。

Speaker 13: I actually have a comment.

演讲者13:实际上我有一个评论。

I work in marketing, so I just wanted to share some tips that I've learned. One is-

我在市场部工作，所以我只想分享一些我学到的技巧。一个是-

Kat Manalac: Here wait, let me give this to you.

在这里，等等，让我把这个给你。

Speaker 13: Thank you. Hi. So, what I've learned over the years is one, journalists live on Twitter, so that's the perfect place, I mean if you're building your product, you should look at which journalist, which publication you want to cover you later, and Twitter is the right place for you to engage with them.

发言人13:谢谢。嗨。那么，这些年我学到的是一个，记者住在推特上，所以这是一个完美的地方，我的意思是，如果你正在开发你的产品，你应该看看哪个记者，你以后想要报道哪个出版物，推特是你与他们接触的合适的地方。

They're super responsive, it works amazingly well. Apart from that, there's this tool call HeRo, which is Helper Reporter, it's just ...

它们的反应非常灵敏，工作效果非常好。除此之外，还有一个叫英雄的工具，是助理记者，只是。。。

That's where journalists send out ...

在那里记者们发出。。。

If they're writing a story, and they need help, and it could be anything from bio tech, to machine learning, to healthcare, to anything, and they send out these emails about what they're looking for, so if that's your passion, if you're an expert in any of those things, you can just ... you don't have to pitch your product, you can just say, "Okay, I'm an expert in XYZ, this is what I think about this topic.", and that reporter is going to be grateful, and you can build relationships like that.

如果他们在写故事,他们需要帮助,这可能是任何事情,从生物技术,机器学习,医疗保健,再到任何事情,他们发电子邮件来说明他们在寻找什么,所以如果这是你的激情,如果你是这些事情的专家,你可以.你不需要推销你的产品,你可以说,“好吧,我是XYZ的专家,这就是我对这个话题的看法。”那个记者会很感激的,你可以建立这样的关系。

Kat Manalac: Yeah, thank you.

是的，谢谢。

That's great.

太好了。

Craig Cannon: It's good advice.

克雷格·坎农:这是个好建议。

Kat Manalac: All right.

好吧。

Craig Cannon: Thank you.

谢谢你。

Kat Manalac: Thank you so much.

感谢你。
