# Suhail Doshi - How to Measure Your Product

Geoff Ralston: We are very grateful to have Suhail Doshi from Mixpanel who co-founded Mixpanel almost 10  years ago now and is going to talk about how to measure your product which  as you heard from Gustaf is really the other side of the coin of growth  and everything that helps you build something that people truly want and will use.

杰夫·拉斯顿：我们非常感谢来自MixPanel的SuhareDoshi，他在近10年前共同创建了MixPanel，现在我们将讨论如何测量您的产品，正如你从Gustaf那里听到的，它确实是增长硬币的另一面，也是帮助您构建人们真正想要和将要使用的东西的一切。

Suhail Doshi: All right.

苏哈伊尔。好的。

Hello, everyone.

大家好。

I'm happy to be here.

我很高兴能在这里。

Awesome.

太棒了。

I thought I would start  off by just kind of like, I sometimes try to change my presentation a little  bit on the fly depending on the audience.

我想，我会从某种程度上说，我有时尝试改变我的发言，在飞行中取决于观众。

I thought I would just ask like  a really quick question, just a quick show of hands, I'm going to define like  a user as like, just someone that uses your product, whether it's ...

我想我会问的像一个非常快速的问题，只是简单的举手，我要定义一个用户，就像一个使用你的产品的人，不管它是.

Whether a  B to B company, paying free, it doesn't really matter like they did something in  your product.

不管是B到B公司，还是免费付款，都不像他们在你的产品上做了什么。

How many people have like zero users right now? Okay, cool awesome.

现在有多少人现在没用户？好吧，酷。

How  many people have 100 or less? Well, okay, you have greater than zero between one  and 100.

有多少人有100人或更少？好吧，1到100之间有大于0的值。

Okay, awesome, great and then how many of you have like more than  10,000? Okay, awesome, all right so we've got ...

好吧，太棒了，那么你们中有多少人有超过1万的？好吧，太棒了，好吧，我们有.

I'd say, majority of people have  zero users right now.

我想说，大多数人现在的用户都是零。

Cool.

酷的

Awesome, great.

太棒了，太棒了。

I'm going to start off with just a  quick about me for those who haven't heard of Mixpanel, I started this company called  Mixpanel, I think the first line of code was written in like October 2008 technically.

首先，我要简单介绍一下那些没有听说过MixPanel的人，我创建了一家名为MixPanel的公司，我认为第一行代码是在2008年10月技术上编写的。

 I was like 20 years old.

我当时才20岁。

I was in my parent's house in my bedroom  and 10 years later, the company has about 300 employees.

我当时在父母家的卧室里，10年后，公司有大约300名员工。

We've raised a bunch of  money and we have about 7,000 paying customers and we're starting to close in on  around 100 million dollars in annual recurring revenue, just to give you a sense of,  yeah 2008 now.

我们已经筹集了一大笔钱，我们有大约7，000名付费客户，我们开始接近每年1亿美元的经常性收入，这只是为了让你了解一下，是的，2008年。

Cool.

酷

Awesome.

太棒了。

If you don't know what Mixpanel is, we make pretty  graphs like this.

如果你不知道MixPanel是什么，我们会做出这样漂亮的图表。

We help you measure what people are doing inside the product so  this is like, someone inviting a colleague to their app.

我们帮助你测量人们在产品中做什么，所以这就像，有人邀请同事来他们的应用程序。

We might help you like  measure a funnel and see the conversion rate of people opening your app to like  viewing an article, we'll help you measure retention.

我们可能会帮助你像测量漏斗，并看到人们打开你的应用程序的转化率喜欢看一篇文章，我们将帮助你衡量保留。

I know Gustaf went over that a  little bit today.

我知道古斯塔夫今天有点过问了。

I'm just showing you this just because like everything that I talk  about today is basically ...

我给你看这个只是因为我今天谈论的一切基本上是.

Is something that you could probably do in Mixpanel or  even any other tool.

是您可能可以在MixPanel甚至任何其他工具中做的事情。

There are a bunch of tools that are great to measure  these things but I want you to know that if you walk out the door  and you wanted to apply in a bit, you totally could.

有一堆工具是很好的衡量这些东西，但我想让你知道，如果你走出大门，你想申请一点，你完全可以。

There's like a premium  plan and we cater very much to startups, those are all of our early customers  so feel free to do that.

这就像一个优质的计划，我们非常迎合初创企业，这些都是我们早期的客户，所以你可以自由地去做。

Awesome.

太棒了。

Great.

太棒了

Today, what I wanted to dive into  was I thought I would take a top-down approach to thinking about analytics and metrics,  instead of kind of coming at you with charts and visualizations and numbers and things  like, I thought it would be better to kind of think about the problem that  you're trying to actually solve and sort of ignore for a moment that you have  to do complex analysis and calculations.

今天，我想深入研究的是，我认为我应该采取自上而下的方法来思考分析和度量，而不是拿着图表、可视化、数字之类的东西来找你，我觉得最好考虑一下你想要解决的问题，暂时忽略一下。必须做复杂的分析和计算。

You will figure that out.

你会弄明白的。

It's not hard or  you'll just use tools that will make that a lot easier for you.

这并不难，否则你只会使用一些工具，这样对你来说就容易多了。

That's one  thing that I thought I would do.

这是我认为我会做的一件事。

I picked these three things.

我挑了这三样东西。

I tried to  think pretty hard about like, what the heck did I care about when I started  a company, like what matter to me? What was on my mind? I thought, well,  I think the first thing is just like do people even understand what I made  and Mixpanel had a really hard time with that in its first 18 months.

我试着很认真地想，当我创办一家公司的时候，我到底在乎什么，比如对我来说有什么关系？我在想什么？我想，嗯，我认为第一件事就是人们是否甚至理解我做了什么，而MixPanel在最初的18个月里经历了一段非常艰难的时期。

We  had to change a lot of things and most people do.

我们不得不改变很多事情，而大多数人都是这样做的。

The second thing is,  okay, great, they kind of understand what it is but do they find it relatively  easy to use the product on day one? That's kind of this never ending mission  that you'll end up taking when you start your company and when you ship your  product.

第二件事是，好吧，很好，他们有点理解它是什么，但是他们发现在第一天使用这个产品相对容易吗？这是一种永无止境的使命，当你开始你的公司和当你交付你的产品时，你最终会承担这个使命。

The last thing is, I kind of try to pair it down a little  bit but I thought the most important thing would be the next, are people coming  back and using my product? I think that you'll find that like ...

最后一件事是，我试着把它放在一起，但是我认为最重要的是接下来，人们会回来使用我的产品吗？我想你会发现.

I know  Gustaf talked about this and I'm going to be extremely repetitive because this is one  of the most important things that early founders make a mistake with.

我知道古斯塔夫谈到过这个问题，我将非常重复，因为这是早期创始人犯错误的最重要的事情之一。

Yeah, so from  there, I thought that I would try to also ...

是的，所以从那以后，我想我也会尝试.

I thought that it will  also be helpful for you to see, it kind of broken down in a formula.

我认为它也会对你有所帮助，它被分解成一个公式。

 This is the formula and I like to think about things from first principles, right?  What are the things that would cause you to grow? They're pretty simple, right? There's  just like people that visit some page or the app, right, basic, you experience this  everyday and then there's like people that sign up and then of those people, who  did something ...

这就是公式，我喜欢从基本原则来思考问题，对吗？什么东西会使你成长？很简单对吧？就像人们访问某个页面或应用程序，对，基本，你每天都会体验到这一点，然后有人注册，然后是那些人，他们做了一些事情.

How many of those people did something valuable like watching a video  or making a recipe or taking a scooter, a scooter ride.

这些人中有多少人做了一些有价值的事情，比如看视频、制作食谱、骑滑板车。

Then, of the people,  how many of those people end up coming back some period of time later and  then how many people will like spread that product, like tell a friend, share it,  maybe even have a sales team, who knows, right? These five things is like basically  equal growth and these are your levers.

那么，在这些人当中，有多少人最终会在一段时间后回来，然后有多少人会喜欢传播这个产品，比如告诉一个朋友，分享它，甚至有一个销售团队，谁知道呢，对吗？这五件事基本上是平等的增长，这是你的杠杆。

The thing that I want to kind of  point out and I want to stress is that, today, I'm going to cover the  basics but I want to kind of impart on you that, the basics are really  important.

我想要指出的是，我想强调的是，今天，我将讨论基本问题，但我想告诉大家，基本知识是非常重要的。

Even thousand person companies get the basics wrong.

即使是千千万万人的公司也会弄错基本知识。

In fact, you'll find that if  you don't get ...

事实上，你会发现如果你不.

Even these thousand person companies like get it wrong, they tend  to over-complicate the number of things that they should actually measure and track and it's  really easy to make 25 metrics conceive of them, align them, divide them all by  ...

即使这一千个人的公司喜欢搞错了，他们往往会使他们应该测量和跟踪的事物的数量变得过于复杂，而且很容易就可以想象出25个指标，对它们进行排列，并将它们除以…。

Give each team five and then really over-complicate something that is actually quite simple  to do and when you over-complicate it, what happens is that companies, even large companies  have immediate paralysis.

给每个团队五个，然后让一些非常简单的事情变得非常复杂，当你让它变得过于复杂的时候，所发生的就是公司，甚至大公司都会立即陷入瘫痪。

Even mid-sized large companies have this like decision making problem.

即使是中型大公司也存在决策问题。

I used  to have this funny phrase at Mixpanel where I used to say that all data  is like contestable.

我曾经在MixPanel上有一个有趣的短语，我曾经说过，所有的数据都是可竞争的。

You could like see this number go off into the right, and  you go, "Well, I don't know, it was like sunny outside and like ..." and  that's why people did it and people like have these arguments no matter what because  causation is really hard to discover.

你可以看到这个数字变成右边，然后你说，“嗯，我不知道，它就像外面阳光明媚，就像.”这就是为什么人们这么做的原因，人们喜欢这些争论，不管是什么，因为因果关系是很难发现的。

What I find is that, just picking like three  to five things, a north star and really simplifying it will do more good for  you and I know because not only have I watched thousands of companies make this  mistake at all sizes, I have made this mistake.

我发现，就像三到五件事，一颗北极星，真的简化它会对你更有好处，我知道，因为我不仅看到数以千计的公司犯了这样的错误，我也犯了这个错误。

I had a piece of paper  that had like 25 sub-metrics and it was nearly impossible to actually keep track of  it and people end up doing is in reality, what people care about is there  are metrics that guide the team and there are metrics that help you monitor and  assess if anything is going wrong and today, we're going to talk about things that  guide the team, okay? Cool.

我有一张纸，上面有大约25个子指标，几乎不可能跟踪它，人们最终做的是现实，人们关心的是，有一些指标可以指导团队，也有一些指标可以帮助你监控和评估是否有任何问题，今天，我们将讨论指导团队的事情，好吗？酷

Great.

太棒了

With this formula, you should be able to assess  anything going wrong in the company, right? If you have a really confusing landing page,  you should be able to figure that out.

有了这个公式，你应该能够评估公司的任何问题，对吗？如果你有一个真正令人困惑的登陆页，你应该能够弄清楚。

If your sign up process is too  difficult, you should be able to figure that out.

如果你的注册过程太困难，你应该能够弄清楚这一点。

If you have a product that  people don't really value, you will figure that out with just that formula.

如果你有一个人们并不真正重视的产品，你就会用这个公式来解决这个问题。

It's just  that simple and you can get more complicated after that, right? You could say, okay,  landing page views are down all of a sudden, why? Is it ...

就这么简单，你可以在那之后变得更复杂，对吧？你可以说，好吧，登陆页面的浏览量突然下降了，为什么？是不是.。

Let me  look at that segmented by country, maybe something happened, maybe I changed something in a  different country.

让我看看按国家划分的，可能发生了什么，也许我在另一个国家改变了什么。

You should be able to assess any reason why you're not growing just  starting out with that.

你应该能够评估你为什么不只是从这个开始成长的任何原因。

That's why I say, starting simple will last a very long  time.

这就是为什么我说，开始简单会持续很长时间。

This is what it looks like, right? Linking those two ideas together, you have  this funnel of people, going from visits to eventually retaining and spreading the product and  like on each one of these things, you're trying to basically solve one of these  three problems.

这就是看上去的样子，对吧？把这两种想法联系在一起，你就有了这个漏斗，从访问到最终保留和推广产品，就像这些东西中的每一个一样，你试图从根本上解决这三个问题中的一个。

Is it easy to understand? Is it easy to get started? Are people  coming back because they find it valuable, and then it loops and the funny thing  about this is, even if you're like Airbnb and you have thousands and thousands of  people, this process of optimizing each one of these steps is never ending, no matter  what scale you're at, you'll always be changing something and you probably have competition so  you have no choice.

容易理解吗？开始容易吗？人们回来是因为他们发现它很有价值，然后它循环而有趣的是，即使你像Airbnb，你有成千上万的人，优化这些步骤中的每一个步骤的过程是永远不会结束的，不管你的规模有多大，你总是会改变一些东西，你可能会有竞争，所以你没有选择。

Awesome, and then once you are able to measure those five  things and assess what's wrong, you have your levers and you should be able to  take action and fix any of those things, put a team on it, maybe you're  fixing it.

太棒了，一旦你能衡量这五件事，评估出了什么问题，你就有了你的杠杆，你应该能够采取行动，解决其中的任何一件事，派一个团队去做，也许你正在修复它。

It is really that simple.

就这么简单。

Awesome.

太棒了。

We're going to start with the first  thing which is, is my product easy to understand? In order to illustrate this idea,  I decided that it would be somewhat sympathetic because I could show you like, really  awesome landing pages of like great companies or I could just show you like what  it's like to start out.

我们要从第一件事开始，我的产品容易理解吗？为了说明这个想法，我决定它会比较有同情心，因为我可以给你展示一些非常棒的登陆页面，比如伟大的公司，或者我可以展示给你看，就像刚开始时的样子。

I also wanted to mention that having a really bad  landing page, there's this really awesome quote that PG used to have in our batch  that I thought I would impart in you, which is that like, people basically just  have their mouse hovering on the back button and they're just waiting to say, "I  don't know what this is, it's confusing," back.

我还想提到的是，有一个非常糟糕的登陆页面，PG在我们的批次中有一句非常棒的话，我想我会把它传授给你，也就是说，人们基本上只是让鼠标悬停在后面的按钮上，他们只是在等着说，“我不知道这是什么，这很让人困惑。”

That's immediately how most companies are just  losing most of their uses from moving on.

这就是大多数公司因为继续发展而失去的大部分用途。

Just remember that your enemy is the  back button.

记住你的敌人是后退按钮。

This is what Mixpanel's first front page look like in 2009.

这就是2009年MixPanel首页的样子。

That's not  what our logo looks like anymore.

我们的标志不再是这样了。

This is a design by me, original design by  me and in all of its glory, if like actually go review the words, there's  like tons of grammatical mistakes because I was horrible at writing.

这是我的设计，我的原创设计，在它的所有荣耀中，如果真的去复习单词，就会有无数的语法错误，因为我的写作很糟糕。

For some reason in  my mind, I thought, "I know what the tagline for the company should be.

出于某种原因，我想，“我知道公司的口号应该是什么。

Metrics  that will make you drool." I guess, I think the reason why was because I  thought these graphs were like so pretty looking compared to what was out there, that  I thought like that would be the value proposition of a company.

这会让你流口水的。“我想，我想原因是因为我认为这些图表和当时的情况相比看起来非常漂亮，我认为这是一家公司的价值主张。

Of course, this  is like totally wrong, like you'll all laugh.

当然，这是完全错误的，就像你们都会笑。

I wish I could have like made  this landing page, presented it to you and then you'd all laugh at me and  I'm like, "Okay, I should change that thing." I didn't have that.

我希望我能把这个登陆页展示给你，然后你们都嘲笑我，我说：“好吧，我应该换个东西。”我没有那个。

I had zero  users at the time and yeah, I tried to target small startup big company.

当时我的用户数为零，是的，我试图把目标对准小型初创大公司。

I  didn't know who I was targeting, application developer, I'm like trying to target everybody.

我不知道我的目标是谁，应用程序开发人员，我就像试图针对每个人一样。

I  think this is ...

我觉得这是.。

Every mistake that one could make on a landing page is  like right here, right, like the sign up button.

一个人在登陆页面上可能犯的每一个错误都像这里，对，就像注册按钮。

At least I kind of got  that right.

至少我说对了。

Thank you Adora for teaching me how to optimize buttons at slide.

谢谢你，阿多拉教我如何优化按钮在幻灯片。

I  made it like yellow but that's about maybe all that I got right, right? Just  maybe roughly the sign up button.

我把它弄成黄色，但这大概是我说的对吧？只是大概按一下注册按钮。

Then, after a lot of work, a lot of  hard work, a lot of iteration, a lot of talking to customers, a lot of  measurement, eventually a couple of years later, it kind of turned into this, right? I  like, manage to get like the logo right.

然后，经过大量的工作，大量的努力工作，大量的迭代，大量的与客户交谈，大量的测量，最终几年后，它变成了这样，对吗？我喜欢，设法把标志弄对。

The sign up button is like ginormous  and yellow.

注册按钮就像大黄花和黄色。

What we figured out though after a lot of time and a lot  of energy was that we transformed from metrics that will make you drool to action  speaks louder than page views and you'll notice it's like extremely prominent, the reason why  was because the number one question that we would get as a company was, that's  cool but like how are you different than Google Analytics, I don't get it, right?  It turned out like this tagline for us at the front page, lasted like the  next five years of the company and because it very much differentiated us as something  where we would measure engagement, we did something different like Google was about page views,  we were about like, what people did in your app and that resonated and then,  from there, we tried to explain like what various ...

我们发现，经过大量的时间和精力之后，我们从让你流口水的指标转变为行动，这比页面浏览量更大，你会注意到它非常突出，原因是因为我们作为一家公司的首要问题是，这很酷，但就像你和谷歌分析(Google Analytics)的不同之处，我不明白，对吗？结果就像我们在首页上的这个标语，就像公司接下来的五年一样，因为它让我们非常不同，我们可以在这里衡量我们的参与度，我们做了一些不同的事情，比如Google是关于页面浏览量的，我们是关于人们在你的应用程序中做了什么的，然后，我们试图从那里解释各种不同的.

We tried to urge people  to go down the website and like look at different features and see if those  things were valuable.

我们试图敦促人们到网站上去看看不同的功能，看看这些东西是否有价值。

We try to be benefits oriented in the copy, tried to show  customers and case studies who maybe found it valuable.

我们试图在副本中以利益为导向，试图向客户和案例研究谁可能发现它有价值。

We probably made like four changes  after this.

我们可能在这之后做了四次改变。

I thought I'd present this one just because it was the one that  maybe lasted, like the copy and the general essence of what we did and what  we said we did, kind of stayed the same largely but lots of design changes.

我想我应该展示这个，因为它可能会持续很长时间，就像我们所做的和我们所说的那样的复制和一般本质，基本上保持不变，但很多设计上的变化。

 The real question is, great, so like how do I measure ...

真正的问题是，很好，所以我该怎么测量.

How did you  measure whether people really understood ...

你是如何衡量人们是否真的理解.。

Whether they understood what you were doing.

他们是否理解你在做什么。

I think  there is like one tried and shared number.

我想好像有一个尝试过的，共享的号码。

It's like very simple, it's just did  people even bother to sign up? Bothering to sign up doesn't mean that they're going  to use your product.

就像很简单，只是人们甚至费心去注册了吗？麻烦注册并不意味着他们会使用你的产品。

That's a whole different matter.

这完全是另一回事。

Bothering to sign up is like,  "I don't know, I'm kind of interested, I mean, I'll kick the tires.

担心注册就像，“我不知道，我有点兴趣，我的意思是，我会踢轮胎。

This seems  kind of interesting and cool to me." That'll tell you a lot about whether what  you're doing is even something valuable for people.

这对我来说似乎很有趣，也很酷。“这将告诉你，你所做的事情是否对人们来说是有价值的。

The second thing that you can try,  these are just ideas, trying to find the ratio of people that are going from  just like hitting your page, right and then doing any kind of thing after that.

第二件事，你可以尝试，这些只是想法，试图找出人的比例，就像点击你的页面，然后再做任何事情。

 Instead of SAKA, instead of hitting the back button, right, like did they click on  segmentation or funnels or attention in that case, did they bother to do that? I  know there are a lot of B to B companies.

而不是SAKA，而不是按后退按钮，对吧，就像他们点击分割，漏斗或注意，在这种情况下，他们是否费心这样做？我知道有很多B到B公司。

Actually, one quick question, how  many people are making like a B to B company? Yeah, great so it's about  half of the room so I thought I'd give a B to B slant.

实际上，一个简单的问题是，有多少人像B到B公司一样制造？是的，太好了，所以这是房间的一半，所以我想我应该给B到B倾斜。

One  thing that I discover was that people ...

我发现的一件事是人们.。

A lot of your user will click  on a pricing page link at the top.

很多用户会点击顶部的定价页面链接。

It's like second or third like most  clicked on link if you're a B to B I think, generally speaking.

一般情况下，如果你是B到B的话，这就像第二或第三次点击链接一样。

I think  ...

我觉得.。

This is totally contestable but I find that people clicking on your pricing page  is like actually pretty decent indicator of like, "Okay, cool, you have something kind of  valuable, okay, how much?" Even something like that I think can tell you a lot.

这是完全有争议的，但我发现人们点击你的定价页面就像一个非常不错的指标，“好吧，酷，你有一些有价值的东西，好吗，多少钱？”即使是这样的东西我想也能告诉你很多。

 Then, if you're a consumer, the benefit of being a consumer is that you generally  have ...

那么，如果你是一个消费者，作为一个消费者的好处是你通常.

Usually will have like hundreds or thousands of users such that you could  actually go do an AB test whereas in B to B it's a lot harder  to achieve that.

通常会有成百上千的用户，这样你就可以进行AB测试，而在B到B中，要做到这一点要困难得多。

I really ...

我真的.。

I think Gustaf is absolutely right that you should  try to conduct as many experiments as you can and really AB test your copywriting  and find out like what resonates with people.

我认为古斯塔夫是绝对正确的，你应该尝试进行尽可能多的实验，真正的AB测试你的文案，找出什么样的共鸣与人们。

These are all things that you can  do to basically figure out, is this easy? Cool.

这些都是你可以做的，基本上，这是容易吗？酷

The second one is well, is  it easy to get started with my product and the thing about this is like,  a lot of people ...

第二个很好，很容易从我的产品开始，事情是这样的，很多人。

The thing about these first two things is that, if  you don't make the first step easy, if it's easy to understand, a lot of  people put so much energy, when we're trying to build a company, we try to  think about like all the cool features and things that we could make that would  be really valuable for customers.

关于前两件事，如果你不让第一步变得容易，如果它很容易理解，很多人投入了这么多精力，当我们试图建立一家公司的时候，我们试着去思考那些我们可以做的很酷的功能和那些对客户来说非常有价值的东西。

The problem with that is like if you don't even  get step one right, you don't even have a chance at any of the subsequent  steps.

这方面的问题是，如果你甚至没有正确的第一步，你甚至没有任何后续步骤的机会。

When we think about like, is it easy to get started with my product  ...

当我们想到，我的产品很容易开始的时候.

Forgot about password is kind of a useless feature.

忘记密码是一种无用的功能。

If you have like a  very small percentage of people that are basically not even bothering to get started.

如果你有一个很小的比例的人，基本上没有麻烦，甚至开始。

In  fact, I remember there is a YC company called Zenter which turned into like Google  Slides.

事实上，我记得有一家名为Zenter的YC公司，它变成了谷歌幻灯片。

I remember Robbie Walker during one of our Tuesday dinner said, that they didn't  even implement the save button for like their online PowerPoint because they knew that none  of their users whatever ask, like, "Hey, can I save this," they just didn't even  bother to do it because they wanted to see would anyone even use the PowerPoint  presentation products.

我记得罗比·沃克(Robbie Walker)在周二的一次晚宴上说，他们甚至没有实现像他们的在线PowerPoint那样的“保存”按钮，因为他们知道他们的用户-不管他们问什么-“嘿，我能保存这个”-他们甚至不想这么做，因为他们想看到任何人会使用PowerPoint演示文稿产品。

When they imparted that on me, I was like, "Wow, that's crazy," and  for like, I don't know maybe like 18 months of Mixpanel, we didn't even have  forgot about password because we were just so ruthlessly trying to prioritize like things that  would really matter to customers.

当他们告诉我，“哇，这太疯狂了”，就像，我不知道大概18个月的MixPanel，我们甚至没有忘记密码，因为我们只是如此无情地试图优先处理那些对客户来说真正重要的事情。

It turned out we didn't get many request anyway.

结果我们还是没收到多少请求。

This  is really important and here's an example of easy to use, something you use every  single day.

这是非常重要的，这里有一个简单易用的例子，你每天都会用到一些东西。

That is literally one step.

这实际上是一步。

You just go to Google, you type it  in and you immediately get to use the product.

你只要去谷歌，输入它，你就可以立即使用该产品。

There's no sign up, there's no  captchas, there's none of that, right? A more complex example is like Airbnb who might  have like 10 steps or something like that.

没有注册，没有帽子，没有这些，对吧？一个更复杂的例子是Airbnb，它可能有10个步骤或者类似的东西。

We worked with Airbnb for a while,  helping them optimize initial user experience.

我们与Airbnb合作了一段时间，帮助他们优化最初的用户体验。

Even though Airbnb probably has like 11 pages of  ...

尽管Airbnb大概有11页.。

You have to go to Airbnb and then you have to fill out this  form and then you get taken to the results and then you click on those  results and then you click on many different results because you're trying to price compare  and you're going through this very complex check out process so there are actually many  steps to booking something online.

你必须去Airbnb，然后填写这张表格，然后你得到结果，然后点击这些结果，然后你点击许多不同的结果，因为你试图进行价格比较，你正在经历一个非常复杂的结账过程，所以实际上有很多步骤可以在线预订一些东西。

Airbnb had to kind of figure out like, how do  we A, describe what we're doing, what we offer, what's useful for the world and  B, how do we help people get started as quickly and as easy as possible.

Airbnb必须弄清楚，我们应该怎样做，描述我们正在做什么，我们提供什么，什么对世界和B有用，我们如何帮助人们尽可能快、更容易地开始工作。

 This is Airbnb.com right now and they have this very simple like, "Book unique homes  and experiences this," you fill out this very basic things and you hit search and  that's it.

这里是Airbnb.com，他们有一个非常简单的例子，“图书独特的家园和体验”，你填写这些非常基本的东西，然后点击搜索，就这样了。

That's their getting started experience.

这是他们刚开始的经历。

It's not their entire flow but it's the  first way to get started.

这不是他们的全部流程，但这是第一个开始的方式。

They even try to like kind of impute something like  what you might be able to find, something they manage to have on Airbnb.

他们甚至试图把一些你能找到的，他们设法在Airbnb上找到的东西归罪于他们。

The  thing is that, this seems simple, right? This seems like something that you could just  like easily make, it doesn't take ...

问题是，这看起来很简单，对吧？这似乎是你可以轻松制作的东西，它不需要.

How hard is that, right? You can do  that with Twitter bootstrap in no time.

有多难，对吧？您可以在Twitter引导下立即做到这一点。

The problem, the thing that's really hard is  like, figuring out that that's the right thing, that's really hard.

问题是，真正困难的事情是，弄清楚这是正确的，那是非常困难的。

That takes like ...

就像.。

 they probably change that 50 times before they figured out, this is the right current  optimal thing at this stage for the company.

在他们发现之前，他们可能改变了50次，这对公司来说是目前的最佳选择。

It takes a lot of work and  you have to grind very hard to get to this point.

这需要大量的工作，你必须非常努力才能达到这一点。

The question is like,  "Okay great, so how do you ...

问题是，“好吧，那你怎么.

How would you measure something like that?" Well,  I think the really simple answer is a funnel.

你会怎么测量这样的东西？“嗯，我认为真正简单的答案是一个漏斗。

How many people go from a  landing page to signing up, to doing that valuable thing like watching a video, doing  ...

有多少人从登陆页面到注册，做一些有价值的事情，比如看视频，做.

In Airbnb's case, it would have been just doing a search, just one search  at least.

就Airbnb的情况而言，它只是在做一次搜索，至少只有一次搜索。

Once you get past that, measuring your funnel for the entire initial user  experience.

一旦你通过了这一点，测量你的漏斗的整个初始用户体验。

It's like, where things were like, there's actually situations in games, games can have  like 20 steps and I've seen hundred of gaming company's funnels and even though they  might have like 20 or 30 steps, sometimes you can ...

就像，在游戏中有很多情况，游戏可以有20步，我看过上百家游戏公司的漏斗，尽管它们可能有20或30步，但有时你可以.。

They actually convert very  highly, like they might get like 80, 90% conversion rate through all those 20 steps.

实际上，他们的转化率非常高，就像他们在这20步中获得了80%到90%的转化率。

 Just the first two are like actually the ones that have the greatest drop off.

前两种情况实际上是有最大下降的。

 The last thing is just like actually speed.

最后一件事就是真正的速度。

This is one that I think a  lot of people don't actually do.

我认为很多人都不会这么做。

It's just like how fast can someone just get  started and that will tell you a lot about how complicated your experience is.

这就像一个人刚刚开始的速度，这将告诉你很多关于你的经验是多么的复杂。

Sometimes  slow is okay, it depends on the business but speed is really important.

有时慢是可以的，这取决于业务，但速度是非常重要的。

Does it  take them like five minutes to get something figured out or does it take a  minute? In Mixpanel's case, we cared a lot about like ...

他们大概需要五分钟才能弄清楚，还是只需要一分钟？在MixPanel的例子中，我们非常关心.

We had a complicated  flow, not only do you have to sign up but you had to be able  to have the right code.

我们有一个复杂的流程，不仅你必须注册，而且你必须有正确的代码。

It's just really complicated and that was the one downside,  we weren't really sure, where people ...

它真的很复杂，这是唯一的缺点，我们不太确定，在哪里人们.

With Google Analytics, you just copy and paste  the Javascript, with Mixpanel, you have to like actually go and track a line of  code.

使用GoogleAnalytics，您只需复制和粘贴Javascript，使用MixPanel，您就必须真正地跟踪一行代码。

We had this question in our mind, was that easy enough? Speed became really  important to us.

我们脑子里有个问题，够容易吗？速度对我们来说变得非常重要。

How fast can someone do that.

有人能以多快的速度做到这一点。

I wanted to give you a  couple tips and tricks.

我想给你一些小窍门。

Things that I have seen that companies do that are generally  like not great.

我所看到的公司所做的事情一般都不太好。

Number one you're a startup.

第一，你是一家初创公司。

You don't have lots of fraud problems.

你没有太多的欺诈问题。

 You don't have ...

你没有.。

You probably don't have a lot of people spamming your service.

你可能没有很多人在乱发你的服务。

 You probably don't have a lot of like fake actors in the system trying to  sign up.

在这个系统里，你可能没有很多像假演员那样的人试图注册。

If you don't have those problems, don't optimize for them until you do  and I just want you to know that generally, email and text confirmations have an  enormous drop off.

如果你没有这些问题，不要为它们进行优化，直到你这样做，我只是想让你知道，一般来说，电子邮件和文本确认有一个巨大的下降。

I'm talking like, you get ...

我说的是，你.

Of the 100% of the people  that come like only 30% will basically go on and click on those email confirmations  or 40%.

在100%喜欢的人中，只有30%的人基本上会继续点击那些电子邮件确认，或者40%。

You spend a lot of time trying to optimize that and then to  even make matters even worst, like you have to hope to God that isn't go  to spam.

你花了很多时间去优化它，甚至使事情变得更糟，就像你必须希望上帝不会去垃圾邮件一样。

It's this really horrendous experience.

这是一次非常可怕的经历。

Just be really careful, you'll lose a lot  of users that way.

小心点，这样你就会失去很多用户。

It's really important to iterate on your initial user experience.

迭代初始用户体验非常重要。

That  will be a never ending process.

这将是一个永无止境的过程。

You will do this forever.

你会永远这样做的。

Even as ...

即使.。

Especially  as the product changes and it becomes really critical to like have someone on it  so at least one responsible person just thinking about that all the time.

特别是随着产品的变化，喜欢有人在上面工作变得非常重要，所以至少有一个负责的人一直在思考这个问题。

Then, the  last thing is, not every company, not every product is capable of doing this but  to the extent that you can just let users into the product, it's always better  to do that.

最后一件事是，并不是每一家公司，也不是每一种产品都能做到这一点，但只要你能让用户进入这个产品，那就更好了。

In Mixpanel's case, it wasn't possible because like we needed to get  your data so you have to sign up but we experimented with like what if  someone just copied and pasted the Javascript but they didn't sign up and we just  collected their data and then after that, we like asked them to sign up? We  did experiments like that so, to the extent that you can achieve this, that's awesome  and good examples of this are actually like Airbnb and Google where you just try  it but there are always exceptions to these rules.

在MixPanel的例子中，这是不可能的，因为我们需要获得您的数据，所以您必须注册，但是我们尝试了，如果有人只是复制和粘贴Javascript，但是他们没有注册，我们只是收集了他们的数据，然后，我们喜欢让他们注册？我们做了这样的实验，所以，只要你能做到这一点，这是很棒的例子，很好的例子，实际上就像Airbnb和Google，你只是在尝试它，但这些规则总是有例外的。

For example, like Pinterest makes you  sign up.

例如，Pinterest让你注册。

They didn't used to but they do now and there are good reasons  for that.

他们以前不这样做，但现在就这么做了，这是有充分理由的。

Then, the last one, definitely not the least, are people coming back? To  me this is probably one of the metrics that is greatly ignored by most startups  and it's often the reason why I've seen companies even with millions of users actually  die.

那么，最后一个，当然不是最不重要的，人们会回来吗？在我看来，这可能是大多数初创企业严重忽视的衡量标准之一，而且这也是我经常看到甚至数以百万计的用户死亡的公司的原因。

I've seen probably 15 different companies that grew virally and then just died.

我看过15家不同的公司，它们都是以病毒形式成长，然后就死了。

The  company died.

公司死了。

I want to demonstrate this in a graph.

我想用图表来演示这一点。

I called this the shark  fin effect.

我称之为鱼翅效应。

The reason why I call it the shark fin effect is because, well,  one was because Mixpanel ...

我之所以称它为鱼翅效应是因为，嗯，一个是因为MixPanel.

In Mixpanel, the default line color for your first data  point is blue and it always ...

在混合面板中，第一个数据点的默认行颜色是蓝色，它总是.

To me it always look like a fin  in the water and it looked a lot like this and what happens is you're  slaving away and you find a way to go viral, right? Maybe you're going super  viral on Facebook or Instagram or something and you're like, "Wow, I have struck gold.

在我看来，它总是像一个鳍在水里，它看起来很像这样，而发生的是，你正在努力工作，你找到了一个途径，以病毒传播，对吗？也许你会在Facebook或Instagram上大受欢迎，然后你会说：“哇，我已经找到金子了。”

 I am acquiring tons of users, my life is awesome, I'm going to be a  billionaire, it's great," right? The problem with this is, is that if it happens too  early but you didn't quite think about retention it becomes really problematic and this hurts  companies.

我获得了大量的用户，我的生活很棒，我将成为一个亿万富翁，这很棒，“对吧？问题是，如果这种情况发生得太早，但你并没有完全考虑保留，它会成为真正的问题，这会伤害到公司。”

Basically, what happens is the app goes viral and then eventually, the rate at  which you're losing users becomes high enough that you can't acquire the new ones.

基本上，这款应用会迅速传播开来，最终，你失去用户的速度会变得足够高，以至于你无法获得新的用户。

It  turns out that like, even though we like to try to be extremely rational people,  it's really hard because like when the app is going viral, you're just like, "Oh  my God, I need to like ...

结果就像，尽管我们喜欢做非常理性的人，但这真的很难，因为当应用程序在网上传播时，你就会说，“哦，天哪，我需要喜欢.

Just take advantage of this moment." "What if  I don't get it and what if my competitor finds it so I'm just going  to optimize, optimize, optimize." It turns out that it ends up not being very valuable  because if you're just losing all the users, it's really, really hard to reactivate.

“如果我没有得到它，如果我的竞争对手发现它，所以我只想优化，优化它。”结果证明它并不是很有价值，因为如果你失去了所有的用户，就很难重新激活它。

If  you talk to people that have ever done like a reactivation campaign, reactivation campaigns generally  don't go very well.

如果你和那些曾经做过恢复运动的人交谈过，那么恢复活动通常不会进行得很好。

You usually just like lose those users until they decide that  maybe they want to give the product a second chance.

你通常喜欢失去那些用户，直到他们决定也许他们想给这个产品第二次机会。

It's not like, your response  is like ...

不是说你的反应是.。

When this happens, a lot of people's response is like, "Oh we  lost the users because our app wasn't valuable." "Let's just email them again and see  if they'll come back." That's seriously not a great idea.

当这种情况发生时，很多人的反应是：“哦，我们失去了用户，因为我们的应用程序不值钱。”“让我们再给他们发电子邮件，看看他们会不会回来。”那可不是个好主意。

It can be really ...

可能真的.。

 it's really important to really think through retention and you really don't want to be  like this guy.

很重要的是要认真考虑留任，你真的不想成为这样的人。

The shark fin effect is really, really bad.

鱼翅效应非常糟糕。

In fact LivingSocial is  a great example.

事实上，LivingSocial就是一个很好的例子。

A lot of people don't know that like LivingSocial is basically this  app that was on Facebook that had nothing to do with like the Groupon, deal  cutting thing and they went super viral on ...

很多人不知道，就像LivingSocial一样，Facebook上的这款应用与Groupon、交易削减之类的东西没有任何关系，于是他们就在网上走红了。

I can't remember exactly what the  product was.

我记不起到底是什么产品了。

LivingSocial literally had to pivot the entire company to basically competing with Groupon  because the app wasn't very retentive in those days.

LivingSocial实际上不得不让整个公司与Groupon进行基本的竞争，因为在那些日子里，这款应用并不是很有独创性。

There's some pretty basic ways to  measure that people are coming back.

有一些非常基本的方法来衡量人们的回归。

The most obvious one that I hope most people  know is that ...

我希望大多数人知道的最明显的是.

It's just new users so making sure that you're tracking whether  a brand new user, someone who just signed up, what percentage of those users will  come back like a week later or 30 days later.

这只是一个新用户，所以要确保你在跟踪一个全新的用户，某个刚刚注册的用户，这些用户中有多少会在一周后或者30天后回来。

It's really important to track  a longer period of time because a week later is just not harsh enough metric  and it's important to see how fast you'll end up losing users because you'll have  to figure out a way to find the new ones and that becomes really, really  hard at some point if the number of users you have becomes ...

跟踪一段较长的时间是非常重要的，因为一周后还不够苛刻，重要的是要知道你最终会有多快地失去用户，因为你必须想办法找到新的用户，如果你的用户数变成…的话，这会变得非常困难.

Starts to  become quite high.

开始变得很高。

The second one is just daily active users.

第二个是每天活跃的用户。

There might be people  that disagree with this.

可能有人不同意这一点。

I don't think there are too many but I now think  that monthly active users has become like the new BS metric, that's like very similar  to like, just like number of registered users, like number of registered user is like  a very silly metric.

我不认为有太多，但我现在认为每月活跃用户已经变成了一个新的BS度量，这就像非常类似的喜欢，就像注册用户的数量，像注册用户的数量是一个非常愚蠢的指标。

I remember seven or eight years ago, I think like ...

我记得七八年前，我想.

 I want to say was like Linkedin came out and said, "We have 200 million  registered users." I was like, who cares how many people are using LinkedIn and I'm  now starting to think that like MAU is becoming quite close to that now.

我想说的是，就像领英(LinkedIn)那样，“我们有2亿注册用户。”我想，谁在乎有多少人在使用LinkedIn，而我现在开始认为，像Mau一样，现在已经很接近这一点了。

Daily  active users is really hard to maintain.

每天活跃的用户确实很难维护。

I mean, how many products do you use  every single day.

我是说，你每天使用多少产品。

If you just look at your phone and you go through all  of the possible apps, how many of those do you actually use every single day.

如果你只看你的手机，你浏览了所有可能的应用程序，你每天实际使用了多少个应用程序。

 I think it's a really harsh metric and we actually found at Mixpanel ...

我认为这是一个非常严酷的指标，我们在MixPanel公司发现了.

So  even if you're a B to B company and you might think, "Well, I don't  know, I'm selling the businesses so like, can I really maintain like daily active users,  especially on Saturday and Sunday," and we actually found that there's like a really, really  strong correlation with daily use and rate of churn, rate of people like no longer  paying for the product.

所以即使你是一家B到B公司，你可能会想，“嗯，我不知道，我销售的业务是这样的，我真的能像每天活跃的用户一样，特别是在周六和周日这样做吗？”我们实际上发现，每天的使用率和流失率都有很强的相关性，像这样的人不再为产品付费。

It didn't take very many users and it was like one  point, four daily actives would like reduce churn to like a dollar churn to like  to sub 10%, it's incredible.

它不需要太多的用户，它就像一个点，每天四次活动会减少到像一美元的搅动，喜欢低于10%，这是难以置信的。

I really stress measuring DAU and then the last thing  is, a B to B slant again is something that I think a lot of  B to B companies make an early mistake with.

我真的很强调测量DAU，最后一件事是，A到B再次倾斜，我认为很多B到B公司很早就犯了错误。

It's actually not just a B  to B company.

事实上，这不仅仅是一家B到B公司。

It's actually companies that do subscription so I don't know if there  are companies that would ever think that they may offer a subscription of any sort,  like if you're a meditation app or something like that.

实际上是那些做订阅的公司，所以我不知道是否有公司会认为他们会提供任何形式的订阅，比如你是一个冥想应用或者类似的东西。

It's just dollar ...

只是美元.。

It's  monthly dollar churn so if you're charging your customers monthly, many businesses charge annually but  usually most startups start with monthly because annual commitments sometimes can be hard for early  adopters.

这是每月的美元周转，所以如果你每月向客户收取费用，很多企业每年都要收费，但通常大多数初创公司都是从每月开始的，因为每年的承诺有时对早期采用者来说是很困难的。

It's just measuring revenue churn.

只是在测量收入流失。

I want to give you a site story, if  you have revenue churn and your revenue churn is say 7% per month, right, you  might think, "Awesome, I'm keeping 93% of these dollars every single month.

我想给你一个网站故事，如果你有收入流失，而你的收入流失是每月7%，对吧，你可能会想，“太好了，我每个月都保留93%的这些美元。

This is awesome,  I'm doing really, really, really well." The problem is, it's a 7% monthly churn and  if you extrapolate that out over 12 months, you're actually losing 58% of your revenue  in a year.

这太棒了，我做得非常好。“问题是，这是一个7%的月流失，如果你推断出超过12个月，你实际上损失了58%的收入在一年内。

It's really harsh.

真的很刺耳。

A lot of people like ...

很多人喜欢.。

For some reason  it's like, this thing is like not mathematically intuitive to most people.

因为某种原因，对大多数人来说，这件事在数学上是不直观的。

I don't know  why.

我不知道为什么。

It wasn't even mathematically intuitive to me early on and if you think about  it, like you're spending all of this energy with marketing and improving the landing page  and improving the getting starting flow.

我在早期甚至没有数学上的直觉，如果你想一想的话，你就会把所有的精力都花在营销和改进登陆页面上，改进开始的流程。

You're doing all of that and if you don't  have retention, if you're losing that 7% every single month, you have to somehow make  up for that 58% that you lost going into the new year.

你所做的一切，如果你没有保留，如果你每一个月失去7%，你必须以某种方式弥补你在新的一年中失去的58%。

If you start  thinking about it like, "Wow, we're making a million dollars and we're losing $580,000 and  we're starting the year like that," you not only have to do that and grow  on top of that.

如果你开始想，“哇，我们赚了一百万美元，我们损失了58万美元，今年就这样开始了。”你不仅要这样做，还要在此基础上成长。

Once your base of revenue gets really high, it becomes really  hard to keep up and you kind of have this like really long arc of  like a shark fin effect basically.

一旦你的收入基数真的很高，你就很难跟上，你就会有这种很长的弧度，就像鱼翅的效果一样。

It's really important to look at your monthly churn  and this will be the single cause of like debt but the problem, it's like  the worst kind of debt.

这是非常重要的，看看你的每月流失，这将是单一的原因，喜欢的债务，但问题是，这是最糟糕的类型的债务。

It's like debt that occurs.

就像债务发生一样。

It's really like ...

真的就像.。

It's  really flat growth but it occurs like eventually in like four or five years, if  you're able to acquire users.

这确实是一个平稳的增长，但如果你能够获得用户的话，它最终会在大约四五年内发生。

I mentioned this, not only because ...

我提到这个，不仅仅是因为.。

I talked to  some founders about this but this is also something that like really hurt us in  the early stages of Mixpanel and we really have to figure out a way to  fix this and there's all kinds of ways you can use product, you can use  pricing.

我和一些创始人谈过这个问题，但在MixPanel的早期阶段，这也对我们造成了很大的伤害，我们必须想办法解决这个问题，有各种各样的方法可以使用产品，也可以使用定价。

There's all kinds of ways to experiment with this but this thing probably gave  me the greatest number of nightmares and lack of sleep I think ever.

有各种各样的方法来尝试这个，但是这个东西可能给了我最多的噩梦和睡眠不足，我想。

I really  want to stress that on all B to B companies here.

我真的想强调这一点，在这里所有的B到B公司。

Really, think through this  number and think about like, almost graph like, "Okay, what would our rate of growth  be if churn stayed constant?" It's really important.

真的，仔细想想这个数字，想一想，几乎是图表，“好吧，如果我们的增长率保持不变，我们的增长率会是多少？”这真的很重要。

Cool.

酷

I wanted to go over two  things.

我想说两件事。

One, I recognized that there are a lot of people here that have zero  users so they're like, what the hell do I measure? What if I have less  than 50 users? Well, the truth is I couldn't really think of a better idea  than just basically, you just have to talk to your users.

第一，我认识到这里有很多人都是零用户，所以他们就像，我到底要测量什么？如果我的用户少于50个呢？事实上，我真的想不出一个更好的主意，只是基本上，你只需要和你的用户交谈。

I thought I'd give  you a mini story about, at least at Mixpanel what we did.

我想我可以给你一个小故事，至少在MixPanel上我们做了什么。

When we had  like no users and I have that page, that just said, metrics you'll drool over,  one trick that I use is that I had like maybe 10 or 11 or  12 customers and honestly, I just put all of them on IM, like on G  Chat or something.

当我们没有用户的时候，我有那个页面，你会流口水的，我用的一个技巧是，我有大约10，11，12个客户，老实说，我只是把他们都放在IM上，比如G聊天之类的。

I don't know what the kids use these days maybe like WhatsApp.

我不知道现在孩子们在用什么，也许就像WhatsApp一样。

 I honestly just like would just badger them on like WhatsApp or G Chat or  whatever and then just ask them.

老实说，我喜欢像WhatsApp或G聊天之类的纠缠他们，然后再问他们。

I remember one time we were trying to redesign  our funnel UI and we used to have a vertical funnel but we had a  competitor that had a horizontal funnel and it seem like that was a better idea.

我记得有一次我们试图重新设计我们的漏斗UI，我们曾经有一个垂直漏斗，但是我们有一个有水平漏斗的竞争对手，这看起来是一个更好的主意。

 It seem like that was more intuitive for customers.

对客户来说，这似乎更直观。

I didn't really know how to  like get the data because like how was I really going to find out whether  they liked one of those two UIs.

我真的不知道怎样才能得到数据，因为我要怎样才能知道他们是否喜欢这两个UI中的一个。

It was just me and a co-founder so  how the heck were we going to like do an AB test on that feature?  There was no realistic way to do that.

只有我和一位联合创始人，所以我们怎么会喜欢对这个特性进行AB测试呢？这样做是不现实的。

All I did was I just made  like a really crappy version of the UI that I thought would be better, the  horizontal version of a funnel.

我所做的就是我只是做了一个非常糟糕的版本的UI，我认为会更好，水平版本的漏斗。

It was kind of like gray scale.

有点像灰度。

I made like  a really beautiful colorful version of like the vertical one which was kind of our  control.

我做了一个非常漂亮的彩色版本，像垂直的，这是我们的控制。

Then, I just asked like 11 people which one is better? Then I want  to impress this thing because Gustaf mentioned that it's the delta, it's the difference that  matters in AB test, not that this is like a true perfect AB test but  like, I asked 11 people on IM, got feedback in a day and 10 out  of the 11 said, horizontal funnels and then we just made it and we built  it and we never looked back and it was totally the right decision in retrospect.

然后，我就问11个人哪一个更好？然后我想给这件事留下深刻印象，因为古斯塔夫提到这是三角洲，这是AB测试的区别，并不是说这是一个真正完美的AB测试，而是，我在IM上询问了11个人，在一天内得到了反馈，其中10人说，水平漏斗，然后我们做了它，我们建造了它，我们从来没有回头看过，回想起来，这完全是正确的决定。

 I don't think there's anyway that you can kind of skirt by, talking to customers  but here's the benefit of talking to customer, even though it feel maybe as more  tedious than looking at a graph.

我不认为你可以用裙子和顾客交谈，但这是与顾客交谈的好处，尽管这感觉可能比看一张图表更乏味。

You're going to get way more information and depth  from talking to customers than you ever will looking at a data point in a  graph.

您将从与客户的交谈中获得更多的信息和深度，而不是查看图表中的数据点。

No matter how much you slice and dice and segment the data, no matter  how mathematical you are about it, you will never get as much information and in  building your own intuition than just talking to customers and it's really critical that you  do it.

不管你切了多少骰子，再细分数据，不管你对它有多数学，在建立你自己的直觉的过程中，你永远不会得到那么多的信息，而仅仅是和客户交谈是非常重要的。

The one thing that I wish I had done back then was I  wish I just wrote it down.

我希望我当时能做的一件事是，我希望我能把它写下来。

I wish I wrote down tons of the feedback  because I think it would have helped ...

我希望我写下了大量的反馈因为我认为这会有帮助.

My co-founder would have helped employees in  the company down the road, really go on the journey.

我的联合创始人会帮助公司的员工走上这条路，真的走上了这条路。

Make them feel like they  went on the journey with me rather than having a role, kind of feeling that  they were so split up.

让他们觉得他们和我一起去旅行，而不是扮演一个角色，感觉他们是如此的分裂。

Then the last thing that I thought I would bring  up is to impart what I kind of said at the beginning which is that,  I think one of the biggest mistakes that people make with analytics is being really  overcomplicated, thinking that they need to be supersophisticated, thinking that they need to track all  kinds of crazy cohorts and they need to have like a dashboard with like 30  pains on it that all like loads, we have like mission control.

最后一件我认为我会提到的事情就是告诉我一开始说的话，那就是，我认为人们在分析中犯的最大的错误之一就是过于复杂，认为他们需要迷信，认为他们需要追踪各种疯狂的人，他们需要像一个人一样。仪表板上有大约30种疼痛，它们都像负载一样，我们有着类似于任务控制的功能。

I don't think  that is necessary.

我不认为那是必要的。

I had that, it didn't work, it was really hard to run  the company that way.

我有过这样的经历，但这不起作用，以这种方式经营公司真的很困难。

What also happens is that when you build your team, it  will be really ...

同样发生的是，当你建立你的团队时，它会真的.

It will be confusing for your team, of those 30 pains  like which one do I need to care about? I think that we need things  that ...

这会让你的团队感到困惑，在这30种痛苦中，我需要关心哪一种？我想我们需要的东西.

Humans just need to simplify things so I'd pick one north star metric.

人类只需简化事物，我就会选择一个北极星度量。

 The north star metric I would choose in this case is like, what is a  number that you're willing to bet the company on, right? If that number goes south,  you deserve to die.

在这种情况下，我选择的北极星度量标准是，你愿意把公司押在哪个数字上，对吗？如果那个数字往南走，你就该死了。

If that number goes up, you will like ...

如果这个数字上升，你会喜欢.。

You will  have like made a huge dent in the universe.

你会在宇宙中产生巨大的凹痕。

What is that metric? I'm not  saying, you need to choose that metric forever but choose it for six months.

这个指标是什么？我不是说，你需要永远选择这个指标，但要选择六个月。

Commit  some time to it and if you find out that it's actually like the wrong  metric which it will be probably the first time you chooses, usually your metrics are  wrong.

投入一些时间，如果您发现它实际上是错误的度量，这可能是您第一次选择，通常您的度量是错误的。

Then, you can change it but commit again for another six months but choose  that one number and then like if what you have to do at the beginning  is basically just like print it out and like put it all around the office,  do it, because people will start to be maniacally focused on it, they'll show up  to meetings and go, "Yeah, but that number is like down, what are we going  to do?" Where you can get really complex is discovering why that number is down  or why it's going up.

然后，你可以改变它，但再承诺六个月，但选择一个数字，然后，如果你必须做的是基本上是打印出来，然后把它放在办公室周围，做它，因为人们会开始疯狂地专注于它，他们会出现在会议上，然后去，“是的，但那是数字就像下降了，我们该怎么办呢？“你能变得非常复杂的地方是发现为什么这个数字在下降，或者为什么它在上升。

That's when you can get really sophisticated.

那时你就可以变得很成熟了。

That's when you  can slice and dice it and figure out what the retention is and things like  and measure it over a funnel but keep things really simple.

这样你就可以把它切成薄片，切成小块，找出什么是保留物和类似的东西，然后在漏斗上测量它，但要让事情变得很简单。

Then, the second thing  is like, don't boil the ocean.

然后，第二件事是，不要煮沸海洋。

Pick three or five other things, I think less  is more and just stay there, telling even large companies ...

选择其他三到五件事，我认为少就是多，就待在那里，告诉大公司.

Most large companies don't  do this and it usually is very discombobulating for the work force.

大多数大公司不这样做，这通常是非常混乱的劳动力。

It's totally fine  to have numbers that you wish to monitor but don't focus on them.

拥有你希望监控的数字，但不要把注意力集中在这些数字上，这是完全可以的。

Awesome, I  think that's it and then, for the people that were like slightly bored, because I  went over the basics, I thought I would help you out by just kind of  having some advanced topics for later that you can read about.

太棒了，我想就是这样了，对那些有点无聊的人来说，因为我复习了一些基本知识，我想我可以帮你做一些高级的话题，供你以后阅读。

Really these are things  that like I found really useful.

就像我发现的一样，这些东西真的很有用。

My favorite one is this one, the Next Feature  Fallacy by Andrew Chen.

我最喜欢的是这个，下一个是陈国强的故事片谬误。

It's just this idea that we always think that like, the  next thing that we make will be the thing that will change the trajectory of  the company, i.e.

我们一直认为，接下来我们要做的就是改变公司的发展轨迹。

Like the next feature is right around the corner and we're going  to be huge and I would really recommend that you read that article.

就像下一个功能即将到来一样，我们将是巨大的，我建议您阅读这篇文章。

It's really  awesome.

真的很棒。

One of my favorite one so for advanced stuff, these are just people worth  following, reading about and can give you more ideas than what I've given you today.

我最喜欢的一个，所以对于高级的东西，这些只是值得关注的人，阅读，可以给你比我今天给你更多的想法。

 Awesome.

太棒了。

Thank you.

谢谢。

Jeff, Q and A.

Jeff，Q和A.

Okay.

好的。

Cool.

酷

All right.
Geoff Ralston: You want me to pick? Do you want me to pick?
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, I want to be fair.

好的杰夫·拉斯顿：你想让我选？你想让我选吗？是的，我想要公平。

I don't be like, if like every speaker chose  someone in the front.
Female: What would you suggest the conversion, some people conversion or trying conversion from visitors to  register, considers registering versus subscribers, obtaining subscribers.
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, the problem with that is that, it's so ...

我不喜欢，如果每个演讲者都选择了前面的某个人。女性：你会建议什么转换，一些人转换或尝试从访客转换注册，考虑登记相对订户，获得订户。是的，问题是，这太.

Yeah, yes, I think someone  asks, what are like good benchmarks for ...

是的，我想有人会问，什么是好的基准.

Given those five steps, visiting, signing up,  using the product, what would be good conversion rates for anyone of those steps.

考虑到这五个步骤，访问、注册、使用产品，对这些步骤中的任何人来说都是很好的转换率。

The  chart part with benchmarks like that, is that it's so dependent on the business in  B to B, like going from like a visit to a sign up, I think  like a four to 5% conversion rate is pretty good.

这类基准的图表部分是，它如此依赖于B到B的业务，就像从访问到注册，我认为像4%到5%的转换率是相当好的。

I think I like swap  notes with Stewart at Slack because we kind of had similar landing pages.

我想我喜欢和斯图尔特在斯拉克交换笔记，因为我们有类似的登陆页。

I think  I ask them, what was your conversion rate at Slack and I think we both  ended up being somewhere around like four to 5% from visit to sign up.

我想我会问他们，你在斯拉克的转换率是多少，我想我们最终都会在4%到5%的地方，从访问到注册。

That's  said, like, I don't know what that would be for something like Airbnb where it's  like getting to a landing page and then searching for your first place that you'd  want to book.

这就是说，我不知道这对于Airbnb之类的东西会是什么，就像登陆页面，然后搜索你想要预订的第一个地方。

I think it's really dependent.

我觉得它真的很依赖。

I know that Mixpanel publish on its  blog, publishes lots of benchmarks.

我知道MixPanel在其博客上发布了很多基准。

I know the marketing team there that does that and  they like publish all kinds of benchmarks for like, what should your retention be if  you're a gaming company, if you're an E-commerce company, if you're a B to B  company, things like that, social company, a video company, things like that.

我认识那里的营销团队，他们喜欢发布各种各样的基准，比如，如果你是一家游戏公司，如果你是一家电子商务公司，如果你是一家B到B公司，社会公司，视频公司，诸如此类的事情，你应该做些什么呢？

I think that  you could probably go there and find various benchmarks reports but it's really dependent on  the business, yeah.
Male: When you go into the sign up process, how do you see numbers vary, if  you're like created an account name, and password, doing all that kind of sign up  versus a single like log in with Google or LinkedIn, yeah, how does that transfer,  do more people sign up if they have that like single click option, do you  see more people drop off because they have to use one of those?
Suhail Doshi: I think the question is what converts better like those social buttons where you can  just like quickly authenticate like Facebook Connect versus just like standard sign up, is that  right? Yeah, all of these questions, they require like a lot of specificity because it's  actually like really unclear.

我认为你可能会去那里找各种各样的基准报告，但这真的取决于业务，是的。男性：当你进入注册过程时，你如何看待数字的变化，如果你喜欢创建一个账户名和密码，做所有这样的注册，而不是像在谷歌或LinkedIn上登录这样的单曲，是的，如何转移，如果他们有这样的点击选项，是否有更多的人注册，你会看到更多的人掉头吗？因为他们必须使用其中之一？苏哈伊尔·杜希：我认为问题是，什么东西能更好地转换，比如那些社交按钮，你可以像Facebook Connect那样快速验证，而不是标准注册，对吗？是的，所有这些问题，它们都需要很大的特异性，因为它实际上是非常不明确的。

In that case, I actually don't know.

那样的话，我真的不知道。

I truly don't know  and so I think the way to answer this question is to find friends in  tangential industries that like don't compete with you but basically do that and then just  be like, "Hey, what is your conversion rate? Have you tried something?" I don't actually  think a lot of those numbers are secrets in reality.

我真的不知道，所以我想回答这个问题的方法是找一些喜欢不和你竞争，但基本上不和你竞争的朋友，然后说，“嘿，你的转化率是多少？你试过什么吗？”实际上，我并不认为这些数字在现实中是秘密。

I mean, you can't go  to your competitor and ask that but most of these things are not like super  duper secret type stuff and like they could either give you the information and save  you the six months or they'll just like say ...

我的意思是，你不能去问你的竞争对手，但是这些东西中的大多数都不像超级秘密类型的东西，它们要么给你信息，然后给你六个月的时间，要么他们就会说.

Or you try it out  but it's sort of strange to keep it a secret so I'd rather give you  ways that you can discover that.

或者你试一试，但保守秘密有点奇怪，所以我宁愿给你一些方法，让你能发现这一点。

I would just ask friends that have a start  up or even if they work at a big company, sometimes they're willing to share  it.

我只想问那些刚开始创业的朋友，或者即使他们在一家大公司工作，有时他们也愿意分享。

Yup.

是啊。

Cool.
Male: You talked about making it easy for user, start using your product and then there's  a slide there [inaudible] .

酷男性：你说过让用户更容易，开始使用你的产品，然后在那里有一个幻灯片[听不见]。

How do you balance simplicity with informing your visitor, like  what it is you do, why they should use your product? You don't have that  brand recognition already where the visitor already had-
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, right.
Male: How do you balance those two?
Suhail Doshi: Right, yeah.

你如何平衡简单与告知你的访问者，就像你是做什么，为什么他们应该使用你的产品？你已经没有客人的品牌认知度了-苏哈伊尔·道希：是啊，是的。男：你如何平衡这两者？是的，是的。

The question is, Airbnb's landing page was super simple and how do you  balance like, I mean what if a lot of people just know about Airbnb and  they just know what to use Airbnb for and then that's why they can keep  it kind of simple versus like having something more complex.

问题是，Airbnb的登陆页面非常简单，你如何平衡，我的意思是，如果很多人只知道Airbnb，他们只知道用Airbnb做什么，这就是为什么他们可以保持简单，而不是更复杂的东西。

A good example of this  is like Craigslist, it's crazy.

这方面的一个很好的例子就是Craigslist，太疯狂了。

If you go to their front page of Craigslist, it's  like absolutely nuts.

如果你去他们的首页的Craigslist，这简直就是疯了。

Even Amazon, if you go to Amazon.com, right? Even though Amazon has  like huge brand recognition, you go to Amazon.com.

即使是亚马逊，如果你去亚马逊网站，对吗？尽管亚马逊拥有巨大的品牌认知度，但你可以访问Amazon.com。

It's like, "Whoa," there's like million things  going on at once, right? How have these companies found the balance, how have they  found how to deal with this complexity and the truth is, is that, I find  that it's important to have like a guiding principle.

就像，“哇”，一次就发生了上百万件事，对吧？这些公司是如何找到平衡的，他们是如何发现如何处理这种复杂性的，而事实是，我发现，拥有一个指导原则是很重要的。

What is it that you're trying  to actually optimize for, right? In the case of YouTube, let's take YouTube as a  good example, right? YouTube could just like be Google, and just like, what do you  look, what do you want to watch? They could do that but they don't.

你真正想要优化的是什么，对吧？以YouTube为例，让我们把YouTube作为一个很好的例子，对吧？YouTube可以是Google，就像，你看什么，你想看什么？他们可以这么做，但他们做不到。

I  think the question really is, is like what is the team at YouTube trying to  optimize for? Are they just trying to get you to like watch a video? Is  Airbnb just trying to get you to search for any kind of hotel, or not  hotel but Airbnb? I think like the team has to develop first a hypothesis of  like what matter ...

我认为真正的问题是，YouTube的团队想要优化什么？他们只是想让你喜欢看视频吗？Airbnb只是想让你寻找任何类型的酒店，或者不是酒店，而是Airbnb？我认为团队首先要想出一个类似什么的假设.

What do we think matters and then from there, it's important  to experiment and try to figure that out.

我们认为什么是重要的，然后，从那里，它是重要的实验，并试图找出这一点。

It turns out like it's not too  ...

结果好像不太.。

Again, it's about the delta of like what people will actually gravitate more towards.

再说一次，这是关于人们实际上会更倾向于什么的三角洲。

 If you make a really simple experience but like people are like really confused, because  they don't even bother to do it or you ask them, then you kind of  have like new information and I think the key is to find the minimum number  of things you need to add to get someone started.

如果你做了一个非常简单的经历，但就像人们很困惑，因为他们甚至不费事去做，或者你问他们，那么你就有了一些喜欢的新信息，我认为关键是找到你需要添加的最小数量的东西来让某人开始工作。

I don't think there's anything  ...

我不认为有什么.。

I'm sure Amazon has tested that front page, like crazy and they found that  it's like quite optimal.

我相信亚马逊已经对头版进行了测试，就像疯了一样，他们发现这是非常理想的。

Yeah.
Male: In your personal experience, do you think that short term videos that's more than two  minutes [inaudible] .
Suhail Doshi: They can.

嗯男性：根据你个人的经验，你认为那些短视频超过两分钟(听不见)吗？他们可以。

It depends on the product.

这取决于产品。

I'll give you an example in Mixpanel's case.

在MixPanel的案例中，我会给出一个例子。

 Sorry.

抱歉的

Yeah.

嗯

The question was are video ...

问题是录像.。

Are one to two minute video tutorials  effective, fair? Yeah, so I think that it's complex.

一到两分钟的视频教程有效、公平吗？所以我觉得很复杂。

We did a video tutorial video  in our flow, for example and like, I would say that, a lot of people  didn't watch it, truthfully and this is what I mean by experimentation.

我们在我们的流程中做了一个视频教程，比如，我想说，很多人没有看过它，这就是我所说的实验的意思。

A lot of  people didn't watch that video tutorial.

很多人没有看过那个视频教程。

I mean, I actually I think eliminated it in  the first three steps but what we did find was this interesting thing that occurred,  as a result of looking and measuring things which was that, we have a feature  in Mixpanel where you can like see every action that a user takes.

我的意思是，实际上我认为在前三个步骤中消除了它，但我们确实发现发生了一件有趣的事情，通过观察和测量事物，我们在MixPanel中有一个特性，您可以看到用户所做的每一个动作。

I would  literally just like go to every user and then just like watch like a creepy  person just like sort of watching like everything that like someone would do in the  product.

我真的很想去找每一个用户，然后就像一个令人毛骨悚然的人一样观看，就像某种程度上的观察，就像在产品中有人会做的任何事情一样。

Eventually when you do that like ...

最终当你这样做的时候.。

When you do hundreds of those and  you just watched hundreds of those, you start to develop some sense of like, okay,  what you developed is an idea, a hypothesis and all of these things require art  and science and I think the companies that take it too far, they like take  it too far to science, end up getting it wrong, they end up optimizing for  like weird things.

当你做了几百个这样的事情时，你开始产生一些类似的感觉，好吧，你发展出的是一个想法，一个假设，所有这些东西都需要艺术和科学，我认为那些把它做得太远的公司，他们喜欢把它搞得太远，结果搞错了，它们最终为类似奇怪的东西进行了优化。

You can always make a button more yellow and bigger.

你总是可以使一个按钮更黄色和更大。

That doesn't  make users happy eventually.

这并不能最终让用户满意。

Anyway, to answer your question, what I found was that lots  of people were just clicking randomly on like all the side menu options and my  hypothesis was, well, they hadn't integrated Mixpanel yet so there's nothing to look at so  what the heck were you doing just like clicking on like funnels and retention, why  would you do that? My hypothesis was, they were just curious like what the product  did, what is it that they did and so we did this AB test, where  we like had a control with like nothing, just the regular clicking around, seeing like  some image and then we had another one that had like videos.

无论如何，为了回答你的问题，我发现很多人只是随机点击，就像所有的边菜单选项一样，我的假设是，他们还没有整合MixPanel，所以没有什么可看的-你到底在做什么，就像点击类似的漏斗和保留，你为什么要这么做？我的假设是，他们只是好奇产品做了什么，他们做了什么，所以我们做了AB测试，我们喜欢有一个控制，没有什么，只是有规律的点击周围，看到一些图像，然后我们有另一个有类似视频的。

Then we tried  to see what cause people to like do their integration, their first integration, what was  the conversion rate and turned out like the video, like super won.

然后我们试着看看是什么让人们喜欢做他们的整合，他们的第一次整合，转换率是多少，就像视频一样，就像超级赢家。

Actually we did  even a more simple test than that.

实际上，我们做了一个比这更简单的测试。

I think we just emailed people a video  and said, "Watch this video, super basic," I didn't even bother to implement it on  the website and I had an amazing conversion rate.

我想我们刚刚给人们发了一段视频，说：“看这个视频，超级基本的，”我甚至都没有在网站上实现它，我有一个惊人的转换率。

Then, we decided to add videos  all ...

然后，我们决定添加所有的视频.。

To all of those tabs where they wouldn't have been anything anyway.

所有这些标签上，它们根本就不会是任何东西。

That's  why I want to say like, I want to stress this, it really depends and  what matters is that you run the experiment to develop a hypothesis, i.e.

这就是为什么我想说，我想强调这一点，这真的取决于，重要的是你运行这个实验来发展一个假设。

The art  not the science and then measure it, which is the science to find out whether  the thing that you thought of was in fact right.

艺术，而不是科学，然后衡量它，这是一种科学，以确定你所想到的事情是否真的是正确的。

Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: All the way to the back.
Male: I have a question for you, it's the churn, the revenue churn.

嗯杰夫·拉斯顿：一直到后面。男：我有个问题要问你，那就是“流失”，“收入流失”。

How does that  relate to [inaudible]
Suhail Doshi: Fifty eight percent loss in revenue, over a year.

这与SuhareDoshi之间有什么关系呢？一年多来，收入损失了58%。

Yup.
Male: You confirmed that we look at ...

是啊。你证实了我们是在.。

Where we look at retention [inaudible] .
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so there's slightly two different things.

在这里我们看到保留[听不见]。苏哈伊尔·杜希：是的，所以有两种不同的东西。

One is like user retention and then one  is like dollar churn like.

一种是用户保留，另一种是像美元一样。

In the case of dollar churn, the reason why I  bring up dollar churn is that, even ...

在美元流失的情况下，我提出美元流失的原因是，甚至.

Like you could totally have a company  where nobody uses the product and the company continues to keep paying for it, right?  What I find that like most companies are like pretty incentivized to cut their spending  and employees are incentivized because they lose it in their budget.

就像你完全可以有一家没有人使用这种产品的公司，而且公司继续为它付费，对吗？我发现，就像大多数公司一样，削减开支是非常有动机的，而员工被激励是因为他们在预算中失去了支出。

With respect to dollar  churn, you could have lot ...

关于美元流失率，你可以有很多.

In a B to B company for example, you  can have even one user using the product but the company could continue to spend  money on it and like, you might see like a 40% retention rate.

例如，在B到B公司，您甚至可以有一个用户使用该产品，但该公司可以继续在该产品上花钱，例如，您可能会看到大约40%的保留率。

It might  be okay, as long as the company is continuing to spend but losing 40% of  your dollars in a year is really hard and not good, retention.

也许没关系，只要公司继续花钱，但在一年中损失你40%的美元是很难的，而且不太好，留住你。

Does that make  sense? Those things are not exactly linked.

这有道理吗？这些事情并不是完全联系在一起的。

They're not directly linked.

它们不是直接联系在一起的。

Yeah.

Yeah, to give  you kind of a benchmark like a chat app that's like often used a lot  will have like 60, 70% retention.

是的，给你一个像聊天应用那样的基准，它经常被使用，会有60%到70%的保留率。

Those are some of the most retentive things.

这些是一些最具保留性的东西。

Something  like Slack would probably have like 80% retention.

像斯莱克这样的东西大概有80%的保留率。

It's kind of like unbelievable.

有点难以置信。

Whereas like  our product, like Mixpanel, when we first started out like the first year, I think  we had like 30, 40% retention and that's not that great, these are our first  few years.

就像我们的产品，像MixPanel，当我们第一年开始的时候，我认为我们保留了大约30%到40%，这并不是很好，这是我们的头几年。

Yeah.
Male: Are these whole metrics, I think you have all four, is that hardware startups, is  the same like you build that we need to go for it?
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, the question is, are these metrics, can they be used for hardware startup.

嗯男：这些指标，我想你有这四个指标，是硬件初创公司，和你构建的一样，我们需要这样做吗？是的，问题是，这些指标可以用于硬件启动吗？

Yeah,  I don't see any reason why.

是啊，我看不出有什么理由。

We worked with Jawbone for a long time and  we work with Fitbit.

我们和Jawbone一起工作了很长时间，我们也和Fitbit一起工作过。

Most hardware ...

大多数硬件.。

Does your hardware company have a software component  to it?
Male: Actually, we do subscription model like [inaudible] .
Suhail Doshi: Okay, so it's a hardware company with subscription model.

你们的硬件公司有软件组件吗？男性：实际上，我们做的订阅模式就像(听不到)。苏哈伊尔·杜希：好吧，这是一家有订阅模式的硬件公司。

Yeah, absolutely.

是的，当然。

It maybe more challenging  as a hardware company to track but it's like, sometimes but it's totally doable.

作为一家硬件公司，它可能更具有挑战性，但它就像，有时，但它是完全可行的。

Most  hardware is like connected to the internet somehow so I don't see any reason why,  like a lot of the scooter companies for example, they're like all connected to hardware  and they have a software component.

大多数硬件都像是连接到互联网上，所以我看不出有什么理由像很多滑板车公司一样，它们都连接到硬件上，并且有一个软件组件。

There's really no difference.

真的没什么区别。

Yeah.
Male: [inaudible] .
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so the question is, the first page was trying to target like various kinds  of sizes of companies and then like the second landing of Mixpanel like in 2012  basically didn't kind of dispose of that and had something very different, it was marketing  features and stuff and how do you figure out like what to do basically from  that point to the next point.

嗯男：[听不见]。是的，所以问题是，第一页试图针对不同规模的公司，然后就像2012年的MixPanel第二次登陆一样，基本上没有处理这个问题，而且有一些非常不同的东西，它是营销特性和东西，从那时到下一个点，你要怎么做呢？

Yeah, so I think the basic gist is that  ...

是的，所以我认为最基本的要点是.

So you can clearly see like I had no idea who our customers were  and then after like a few years, you talk to users, you ask them like  what size of company they are, if they sign up, if you want to, we  didn't do that but we just spent a lot of time ...

所以你可以清楚地看到，好像我不知道我们的客户是谁，然后几年后，你和用户交谈，问他们是多大的公司，如果他们注册，如果你想，我们没有这么做，但我们只是花了很多时间.

It was so  obvious that like everyone that was signing up for Mixpanel at that time was a  startup.

很明显，和当时注册MixPanel的所有人一样，它也是一家初创公司。

In our case, it would be, we call that a small business.
Male: [inaudible]
Suhail Doshi: I think it took like maybe no longer than six months to figure out that  we were not going to sign up a large company.

在我们的例子中，我们称之为小企业。男：(听不见)苏哈伊尔·杜希：我想大概用不了六个月的时间才知道我们不会签约一家大公司。

Yeah.

嗯

We just didn't have  the product, it just wasn't there, we hadn't worked on it long enough so the  only people that were willing to basically try were companies that could take the risk  to try it and most of these companies didn't have anything anyway so it was  even easier.

我们只是没有这个产品，只是它没有在那里，我们没有在它上工作足够长的时间，所以唯一愿意尝试的人基本上是那些冒着风险去尝试的公司，而这些公司中的大多数都没有任何东西，所以它甚至更容易。

It's easier to target companies that had nothing and had ...

更容易的目标是那些一无所有的公司.

Were willing  to bear risk and then most of the time, I would always employ this trick  where I would just ...

我愿意承担风险，然后大多数时候，我都会用这个伎俩.

I would charge the money for it and then if  they said no, I would just give it to them for free because the feedback  was more important.

我会收取这笔钱，然后如果他们说不，我会给他们免费，因为反馈是更重要的。

I always wanted to see if they would pay for it and  so the only people that are willing to do that are also small businesses, it  turns out.

我一直想知道他们是否愿意为此付出代价，因此，事实证明，唯一愿意这样做的人也是小企业。

For us it was just like ...

对我们来说就像.。

It kind of hit us, it  slapped us in the face, it wasn't like this hard thing to figure out.

它击中了我们，打了我们一巴掌，这并不是一件很难搞清楚的事情。

Yeah.
Male: [inaudible] .
Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so to be clear, we weren't necessarily building things to bring new users on.

嗯男：[听不见]。苏哈伊尔·杜希：是的，所以说清楚，我们并不是为了吸引新的用户而建造新的东西。

 Sorry, the question is you guys built, forgot about ...

抱歉，问题是你们建的，忘了.

You decided to not build  forgot about password, how do you know when to build quality of life features versus  features that just acquire new users? Yeah, so I think that we didn't ...

您决定不构建密码，您如何知道什么时候应该构建生活质量特性，而不是仅仅获得新用户的功能？所以我觉得我们没有.。

It  wasn't so much that only built features to acquire new users.

这并不仅仅是为了获得新用户而构建的功能。

We built features to  acquire new users and to keep existing users.

我们建立了功能来获得新的用户和保持现有的用户。

We were very focused on like parts  of the product that would actually make a difference, right, that would be clearly differentiating  compared to all of the other possible options out there.

我们非常专注于产品的某些部分，这些部分实际上会产生不同的效果，对吧，与所有其他可能的选择相比，这将是非常明显的区别。

One of the things that's  like not different is whether you have forgot about password, right? That was like in  the bucket things that like maybe don't matter.

有一件事没有什么不同，那就是你是否忘记了密码，对吗？就像在桶里一样-就像那些不重要的东西。

I think the question is really like,  when does it become a problem enough for you that it's worth building, right? If  you're finding that like it turns out that the number of request that you're getting  for forgot about password is like increasing and then manually doing this process, it's like  annoying.

我想问题是，什么时候这个问题对你来说已经足够值得去建设了，对吧？如果你发现你想忘记密码的请求数量增加了，然后手动处理，那就很烦人了。

Then, you should just build that feature because you know that if you don't  build a feature, they can't log in then you can't retain them and then you  lose them.

然后，你应该构建这个特性，因为你知道如果你不构建一个特性，他们就不能登录，那么你就不能保留它们，然后你就会失去它们。

It becomes this flywheel effect where like the only way to retain them  is to do that.

这就变成了飞轮效应，就像保留飞轮的唯一方法一样，就是这样做。

In fact, even though Mixpanel didn't build forgot about password, for  like maybe 12 to 18 months, we went eventually ...

事实上，尽管MixPanel并没有忘记密码，但大概有12到18个月，我们最终.

We found that people would  try like multiple times, when I was looking at that stream of every action that  a user would take, I found that like people were like going to the log  in screen like five times.

我们发现人们会尝试多次，当我看到用户所做的每一个动作的流时，我发现人们就像五次进入登录屏幕一样。

I was just so confused.

我只是很困惑。

I was like, "Why are  they going to the log in screen five times?" I was like, "I think it's  because they can't log in." Some people don't even hit forgot about password, they just  like try, try, try.

我想，“他们为什么要五次去登录屏幕？”我说，“我想是因为他们不能登录。”有些人甚至没有点击忘记密码，他们只是喜欢尝试，尝试。

I'm sure you've all done this like with a bank or  something, you're like, "I'll just do it tomorrow," you don't even bother.

我敢肯定你们都像对待银行什么的，你就像，“我明天就去做，”你甚至都不麻烦。

It turns out  that even that happens and so we went so far, even though we didn't do  that, I like to think that like we really made up for this later on.

事实证明，即使发生了这种情况，我们也走了这么远，尽管我们没有这么做，但我喜欢这样想，就像我们后来真的弥补了这一点一样。

 We went to ...

我们去了.。

So far, we found this clever trick that Facebook use which  was that, when you failed to log in to Mixpanel like three times, on your  third time, we just send you an email that says, "We just sent you an  email.

到目前为止，我们发现Facebook使用了一个巧妙的技巧-当你三次未能登录MixPanel时，我们给你发了一封电子邮件，上面写着：“我们刚给你发了一封电子邮件。

Just go to your email and click the button and you'll log in right  now.

只要转到你的电子邮件，点击按钮，你将立即登录。

Don't worry about forgetting it, don't worry about changing your password, just log in."  It turned out that like that had this great retentive effect because we were really  focused on retention at that time.

别担心忘记了，不用担心修改密码，只要登录就行了。

Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: Okay, a couple more questions, over here.
Male: [inaudible]
Suhail Doshi: Yeah.

嗯杰夫·拉斯顿：好的，还有几个问题，在这里。男：(听不见)苏哈伊尔·杜希：是的。

How do you gauge product market fit? How do you measure product market fit?  I think there's a lot of people that probably have already ...

你如何衡量产品市场是否合适？你如何衡量产品市场的契合度？我想很多人可能已经.

Will talk about  or have already talked about like people ...

会像人们一样谈论或已经谈论过.。

And I think they're all right so  I'll give you a quantitative slant versus like a qualitative slant.

我认为它们是正确的，所以我会给你一个定量的倾斜，相对于一个定性的倾斜。

Some qualitative slants were  things like when people are willing to spread you to their friends, that kind of  thing.

一些定性的倾向是当人们愿意把你传播给他们的朋友，诸如此类的事情。

The quantitative version of this is really just measuring your retention, like how many  people ...

它的定量版本实际上只是测量你的记忆力，比如有多少人.

It's really measuring like DAU, it's really measuring the percentage of people that  come back a week later, 30 days later.

它真的像DAU一样，测量了一周后，30天后回来的人的比例。

It's a number of people that like  become almost they need your product or they feel like life will be a lot  worse.

很多人喜欢成为几乎他们需要你的产品，或者他们觉得生活会更糟。

I think that you can totally measure that by how they use it and  so I think the quantitative measurement is basically finding like some benchmark, some cents for  your industry, maybe that's like 30% and just remember like that benchmark is probably like  average and your desires is to basically be above average.

我认为你完全可以通过他们如何使用它来衡量，所以我认为量化测量基本上就像一些基准，对你的行业来说，可能是30%。记住，这个基准很可能是平均水平，而你的愿望基本上是高于平均水平的。

If you can like significantly  beat that benchmark, then I think that you've like really ...

如果你喜欢大大超过基准，那么我认为你真的很喜欢.

You've done better than  probably product market fit.

你做得比可能的产品市场更适合。

I think that's one thing.

我想这是一回事。

I think another thing is like,  you can try to measure like overall like, repetitive use, like frequent use in a  day.

我认为另一件事是，你可以试着测量，像总体上一样，重复使用，比如一天中频繁使用。

You can make pretty harsh metrics.

你可以做出相当苛刻的衡量标准。

You can be like, for example with DAU,  you could say, "I don't want it to just be daily active user like they  did one thing.

比如DAU，你可以说，“我不想让它成为每天活跃的用户，就像他们做一件事一样。

I want it to be ...

我希望它是.。

That user has to have watched  five videos and then and only then do they count as a daily active user,"  so you can be particularly harsh about that metric, right? Someone coming and like ...

那个用户必须看了五段视频，然后他们才算为每天活跃的用户，“所以你可以对这个指标特别苛刻，对吧？有人来了，喜欢…。

 That's why I say MAU is kind of a BS metric now because you come  and watch one video and then never come back again and you like count and  that's not like a very healthy business so I think that find ways to be  harsh about your north star and I think that you'll find that you reach product  market fit, yeah.

这就是为什么我说Mau现在有点像BS标准，因为你来看一段视频，然后就再也不回来了，你喜欢计数，这不像一个非常健康的行业，所以我认为要想办法对你的北极星苛刻，我想你会发现你进入了产品市场，是的。

Yeah, I think with Mixpanel it was like, 30, 40% retention, it  was like really horrendous and we totally didn't have product market fit yet.

是的，我认为混合面板的保存率是30%，40%，这真的很可怕，而且我们还没有完全适应产品市场。

Yeah.
Geoff Ralston: Okay.

嗯杰夫·拉斯顿：好的。

Last question.
Male: What is one piece of conventional startup wisdom that you think is usually wrong?
Suhail Doshi: It's like a Peter Thiel question, what's one piece of conventional wisdom that you think  is generally wrong?
Male: About startups.
Suhail Doshi: About startups in general.
Geoff Ralston: It's a hard last question.
Suhail Doshi: It's a hard last question.

最后一个问题。男：什么是传统的创业智慧，你认为通常是错误的？苏哈伊尔·杜希：这就像一个彼得·泰尔的问题，你认为一个普遍错误的传统智慧是什么？男性：关于初创公司。总体上讲，是关于初创公司的。杰夫·拉斯顿：这是最后一个很难回答的问题。这是最后一个很难回答的问题。

It's like everything else is fine.

其他一切都很好。

I think ...

我觉得.。

I  don't know, I need to think about it but I think that one thing that  has like become pretty clear to me is that I think after having done Mixpanel  for about a decade, I kind of figured out that ...

我不知道，我需要考虑一下，但我认为有一件事对我来说已经很清楚了，我认为在做了大约十年的混合面板之后，我有点想出了.

I tried to impart  it on you in the talk today, which is just that, it's much better to  just like ...

我试着在今天的演讲中把它传达给你，只是，最好是.

I think that we tend to complicate things as humans and that  comes through in like everything.

我认为，作为人类，我们往往会把事情复杂化，这就像一切事物一样。

For example like we tend to make a version one  of a product and then we get to version two and we're like, "Okay, we're  done." We're like, we did it, we solve the problem and then often a found  were like, kind of get distracted and then go and like work on the next  product, the next thing and they haven't yet figured out like their retention is probably  not great or they're operating at negative margins or like all these things.

例如，我们倾向于将一个版本作为产品的一个版本，然后我们进入第二个版本，我们会说，“好的，我们完成了。”我们就像，我们做了，我们解决了问题，然后一个发现通常是，有点心烦意乱，然后去喜欢下一个产品的工作，接下来的事情，他们还没有弄明白，他们的保留可能不是很好，或者他们是在负利润或类似的事情。

That same  thing even happens with numbers like we pick our three metrics and then we continue  to get more complex as a business and then we add the next 20 things  and we do all these things to like ...

同样的事情甚至发生在数字上，比如我们选择我们的三个度量标准，然后我们继续变得更加复杂，作为一个企业，然后我们添加接下来的20件事情，我们做所有这些事情来喜欢.

In hopes of like, feeling like  we control the situation better and I just think that those are all distractions and  mistakes and I think it's really hard for the average founder to actually just be  focused on something boring.

希望我们能更好地控制局面，我只是觉得这些都是干扰和错误，我认为普通的创始人很难把注意力集中在无聊的事情上。

We tend to have like 80 or something and like we  just decide to get very easily distracted and I think it's hard to do something  ...

我们倾向于有80或什么东西，就像我们决定很容易分心，我认为很难做一些事情.

Do the same thing for four or five years, because we don't like feel  challenged anymore and I think that's a huge mistake that founders often make and I  don't know that anyone say, "Oh that's like totally wrong Suhail." For whatever reason like  every founder repeats it.

四、五年都要做同样的事情，因为我们不想再感到挑战了，我认为这是创始人经常犯的一个巨大错误，我不知道有人会说，“哦，这就像完全错了，苏哈伊尔。”不管出于什么原因，就像每一位创始人一样重复着它。

There must be something, I don't know ...

一定有什么事，我不知道.

There must be  some kind of wisdom that we all think this is the right thing and I  made those mistakes.

一定有某种智慧，我们都认为这是正确的事情，我犯了这些错误。

I made new products that I shouldn't have.

我做了不该做的新产品。

I've measured too many  things, over-optimized things that didn't need to be optimized so yeah, that's it.

我测量了太多的东西，过度优化的东西，不需要优化，所以，是的，就是这样。

Cool.

酷

Thanks.

Geoff Ralston: Thank you Suhail.
