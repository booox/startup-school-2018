# A Conversation with Werner Vogels

Kyle Corbitt: This is a real privilege for me. We are here today with Dr. Werner Vogels. He is the CTO of Amazon, and of course has a lot of really exciting experience with that.

So we're gonna be talking to him today about his experience with Amazon, about his experience with start-ups, and about lots of technical topics as well that will be relevant to many of us.

So thank you all, and let's give it up for Dr. Vogels.

Werner Vogels: Thank you.

Kyle Corbitt: Okay.

So we're going to be talking, of course, about Amazon today, and about your role there. But I'd like to start with a little bit of background. Would you mind telling us about your career before you started at Amazon, and what brought you to that point?

Werner Vogels: How much time do we have? I was an academic before I joined Amazon. I'd been a research scientist at Cornell for ten years, building very large scale distributed systems. And as in common in America and academia, you'd be motivated to do startups on the side.

So we did two startups on the side, one of them that already existed when I joined them.

They got sold off and were successful to a company called Stratus. I don't know if anybody remembers that. It was before your time.

And the other company that actually failed. We had both experiences and that was great. Kind of.

So before that ... I'm not a typical computer scientist. I wasn't until 28 when I decided to actually to go back to school. I worked in hospitals before that, radiotherapy.

The dutch Cancer Research Institute doing radiotherapy on cancer patients. At one moment I realized that I really hated all these people dying around me. I decided to go do something that had no humans involved whatsoever. Computer science seemed like a really good thing to go into.

This is mid-80s.

So computer science is nowhere where it is now today. But it turned out I had a-

Kyle Corbitt: There weren't any humans back then.

Werner Vogels: You put it like that, yeah. It turned out I had a gift for it. I didn't know that up front.

And from there I went into research because those were the kind of things that I really was interested in. Got my PhD, worked in Portugal for a number of years at a research institute and then I was invited to come to Cornell.

And then at one moment ... What I did do around that time also, when I was still at Cornell, was actually either consult for large companies like HP and [inaudible] of this world.

And also often gave talks.

And so at one moment, Amazon invited me to come give a talk about some of the material that I was working on.

And I think, like, really? Really, do I have to go? What is this? This is a book shop.

You know, web surf and a database, how hard can it be? And one glimpse in that kitchen, however, and I realized that this a massive technology operation. It's not a retailer, it's a technology company, and operating at a scale that I'd never seen before, definitely not at other companies that I'd consulted for.

The challenges that they were faced with from a distributed systems research perspective were amazing. I didn't need to think very hard when they offered me a job.

Kyle Corbitt: Wow, that's incredible.

That's interesting. Do you feel like that was a change? Like today the interesting distributed systems problems are huge companies and maybe before it was academia? Or was that just, that's the way your career happened to go?

Werner Vogels: No, I think that still is the case. I think most distributed researchers have become aware of the kind of scale that these very large companies need to operate at. Or not even these very large companies. If you think about, any successful internet company, or digital only company, needs to operate at a scale that is unparalleled. 2004 when I joined Amazon, many of you, if you're going to be successful will be easily operating at that particular scale that Amazon was at in 2004. But there was no body of work that you could really rely on.

There was no infrastructure that you had to rely on.

So a lot of effort went into basically keeping the lights on things that cloud and other technologies now gives you. Amazon had got it in 2004 to a scale purely by being practical.

And it's not that there was a book or so that you could read how to build a scalable organization or a scalable company, no it didn't.

And so everything, Amazon was sort of in my eyes, five to 10 years ahead of the curve both in terms of the usage of technology, of the development of technology but also at the operational scale.

And especially if you want to be a fast-moving company. It's not like you could like traditional enterprises because they all suffered from innovator's dilemma and a lot of things that are really slow at one moment once it becomes successful. How to build a company that needs to continue to move fast is a whole different story.

You may be making business trade-offs. For example, the creation of technical debt or allowing duplication to happen or things like that, that would be out of the question in a traditional enterprise because efficiency is their main goal. At Amazon, moving fast and innovating fast and having a very long pipeline of experiments, that's the most important thing.

So you're willing to allow duplication to happen, you allow to create technical debt as long as you know that you have to pay it off.

So there's many trade-offs that Amazon has been willing to make over time that you can't find in a traditional MBA book. Most of these things, Amazon had to develop for themselves. Whether it's technology or whether it's processes, or business processes. It helps, of course, with Jeff Bezos at the helm, you have someone who is a true visionary and truly understands how the next modern world will look like, or should look like.

Kyle Corbitt: Thanks.

So a couple of years after you joined, you were appointed the CTO of Amazon.

Werner Vogels: Six months, actually.

Kyle Corbitt: Oh, really?

Werner Vogels: Someone asked you, do you want to be the CTO? You think, “He's not going to ask next year, is he?” [inaudible] , who is still at the company, by the way, he really wanted to be a developer and they had been looking for a [inaudible] replacement for him.

And as I said earlier, sometimes you have gifts that you don't know about until you start doing them. I think I joined in September and I think in January I became the CTO.

Kyle Corbitt: Wow.

So tell me what that was like at Amazon and then what that role has shifted into as we get 'till today.

Werner Vogels: One of the things that at Amazon, one of the reasons for hiring me and actually a few of my ... I brought, actually, was it? I brought five of my former students with me when I came there, was really to insert more academic rigor into the way that we wanted to approach scaling. Where Amazon had become really good at scale but the challenge was that we wanted to do orders of magnitude more. In lessons, we go from order of magnitude growth.

You have to revisit almost everything that you do, whether it's your processes, but also your technologies. To really be on a solid footing, to do the next one, or to orders of magnitude of growth that were coming, we needed to insert way more rigor into our thinking.

And that was, for example, around performance. How do you measure? What kind of infrastructure do we need for measurements? If you want to be a truly data-driven company that makes data-driven decisions, you need to first of all have the data, but you also need to have a culture around how do you measure? And how do you interpret those measurements? I mean, the medium latency of let's say, one point two seconds off your web page to your customers doesn't say anything. It just says that 50% of your customers have a worse experience.

You need to know how much worse.

And then from an engineering ...

So, for example, the 99 percentile or the 99.9 percentile is way more important often in those cases.

And then how do you create an engineering discipline that has control over that 99 percentile so that you can actually start pulling it in, if that's what you want to do? And then be able to associate that with business decisions. For example, the common knowledge is that if you improve latencies of your web pages, conversion goes up.

The question then is, how much are you willing to spend to drive that conversion up? You need to have more capacity, you need to do more engineering. When do you have a diminishing return on the investments that you have to make to get that control.

So for a whole year we focused really on performance and measurement and things like that, there was a bit of it in progress already when I joined. We did a whole year on focusing on single point of failure. Really, I think in 2004 we were pretty good in terms of reliability.

There were rules around, so we had to use [sea] data centers.

You had to replicate whatever you did over these sea data centers, you'll be able to lose a data center. Customers should not be impacted.

So you could lose two data centers, customer can be impacted in terms of latency but not in functionality. All of those rules were there and I think we were pretty good at it, until at one moment we decided so why don't we pull the plug out of one of these data centers? And see what happens? And the first time that we did this was not like we made it as a surprise. No, we gave everybody a heads up that this is what we're going to do. We're not really pulling the plug. I mean, you pull the network, basically, so data center gets isolated. Turns out all these things that look great on paper, didn't really look that great in practice. Although the first time when you do it, lots of manual processes still, manual data base fail overs, things like that.

This was all pre-AWS.

So a whole year focusing on that. By the time you do the third or the fourth of these, what we call game days, you actually get to a point where these things become really well automated and that you can actually do them without human intervention. One biggest surprise when we did the first time was ...

And then you bring the other data center back on line.

And then suddenly that data center has to sync with your other data centers. Man, that's a nightmare.

That was a scenario that nobody had thought about. But until you do these things, you don't know them.

And especially that scale.

And then we did a year on efficiency, we did some other things. Mostly the role of the CTO is to drive really big programs and think about what is the technology that we need for the future to be able to be on solid footing as a business? Or in the case of Amazon, what other kinds of unique technologies that we've developed that we maybe be able to turn into a business? Then things change at one moment because in the early 2000s, we put an API on the catalog. That was popular in those days.

You just put an API on something, see what innovation happens.

And it turns out, lots of great companies were being built.

So we'd have access to the catalog, search, shopping cart and I think one more functionality.

Anyway, so lots of new e-commerce companies were being built based on the Amazon catalog.

And they would do comparison shopping and have wonderful new UIs to enrich the whole site, really great stuff being built. But as soon as one of those companies became successful, they all started to stutter in their execution.

They all needed to get investment, not because they needed to operate through the business operations, they all need to start buying hardware.

And they need to hire IT people. All this investment was in essence, an indirect funding of the American hardware industry. All of these companies had a hard time doing that.

They had a hard time getting the investment, they had a hard time getting the hardware because you might order 50 servers. It's not like driving up to Costco and actually getting them in your shopping cart.

And then hire IT people and things like that.

So most of those companies that were initially successful around the Amazon catalog all failed.

And they didn't fail because they didn't have great ideas, they failed because they couldn't get their IT stuff ready or get the money to actually do that.

And I think one of the things that got shifted with AWS and Cloud is that the investment that you get no longer goes in large numbers to hardware companies. It goes into hiring more people that are relevant for your company and actually build your products better.

Then we become ... We started AWS, we can talk more about that later. But when you become a technology provider, your role as a CTO changes. I wrote a blog post once about this. In my eyes, there's sort of four different types of CTO. First of all, ask any large company. Every large company, the role of CTO will be different. But I think there's sort of four large categories. One is in enterprises, they're often the infrastructure manager.

They report to the CIO, manages large amounts of infrastructure.

And then there is the second role I think is that of, what you often see in younger businesses, where the CTO is the technical co-founder, the one with the technical vision. I do think that that role is a dangerous one because there's so many other things that actually fall into that bucket in terms of [inaudible] engineering teams and things like that.

The CTOs may not necessarily be good at, but we'll talk about that later.

Then there is the role of a big thinker.

That is really where you're driving innovation. If you look at companies like AT&T and Lucent and others, they've all had CTOs or had an office of the CTO that will be really building next generation technologies or experimentation there.

And then there is the role of the external facing technologist. If you're a technology provider to other companies, there's a role for an executive to actually interact at a deep technical level with your customers to understand how are they using my products? And looking for deep, bigger patterns among your customers. What are the bigger pain points that they still have? Not only with our technology, but just in general.

You know, I've often jokily said, so we're in the business of pain management, AWS. Yeah, so what kind of pain do customers still have that they have to work on that actually don't contribute to the products that they want to build? That's on one hand helping customers understand things, sort of being a bit of the evangelist for the whole notion of Cloud, which definitely let's say, 10 years ago was much more important than it is now. But then, most importantly, take the feedback from your customers back and start thinking about what new features or products you have to do or what kind of processes we need to change to make sure we serve our customers better. It's a much more customer-focused position than a technology-focused one.

Kyle Corbitt: Great. I'm curious, you were talking earlier about, especially in the early days, there were lots of tasks like the game day that you were talking about to make sure that the infrastructure was up for scale. I'm curious if you've noticed in your time in Amazon as it's grown, and the engineering culture has grown so much, are they any tips or tricks you've seen on how to grow an engineering culture and keep it moving quickly? Keep it effective?

Werner Vogels: Well, given that Amazon is in reality my first real job, for a long time I thought that the rest of the world was just like Amazon. It's not.

There's a very unique culture at Amazon I think that works really well for fast moving companies.

And at least to build your teams as independent as possible. To remove as much hierarchy and structure from your organization as [inaudible] . Hierarchy, in my eyes, is totally unnatural. I mean, you need to have some form of hierarchy maybe for reporting or things like that or for some management pieces. But if you look at nature, there's a head monkey and all the other monkeys.

There are no lieutenant monkeys. Yeah? No. I mean, you may have multiple of groups of this, all with their head monkey.

And it scales really well. I mean, if you look at ants and all the patterns in nature, if you're able to build a self-organizing organization, which means basically that you hire people that really want to be independent. Not want to be followers. That actually want to own a piece of the product and actually take ownership on that. I think that's extremely important when you're a younger business. Where you don't need followers.

You don't need just coders.

You need people that want to have ownership over the piece that you want.

And I think, look for that.

There is something at Amazon that we call a leadership principles.

There's 14 of them and basically, that's all around culture.

And so it's customer obsession, ownership, dive deep, and so there's 14 of them. Check 'em out. If you type them in your favorite search engine, you'll find them and a deep explanation of all of them. But that really drives what the Amazon culture is. When we hire, let's say we bring in someone for an interview, you've probably really figured out whether he or she's a good enough engineer through the phone interviews and things like that.

Your interviews are all about culture. It's really, do you have a real good culture fit? Because there's nothing worse than a bad hire when it comes to the culture kind of environment. Because, that disrupts your small teams tremendously.

So with Amazon, we're a strong believer in very small teams.

So 10 to 12 people. Because with 10 to 12 people, everybody knows of each other what you're doing. I mean, by the way, if you want a scrum, if you want to stand in the corridor in the morning with 25 people, that doesn't work.

You're really focusing on small teams and making sure that they have strong ownership over the pieces that they need to do. One of the building teams that are independent thinkers, want to have control over their own destiny, I think is important. I think one of the challenges is when you grow with a young business, often, I mean the role of a CTO originally is probably that he does everything that has to do with tech. Basically, you think about technology, but also manage the teams. Now, I think managing teams is a completely different discipline. Now, there's a major difference between what I would call a VP of engineering and the CTO. VP of engineering every morning wakes up thinking “Do I have the absolute best team? Is my team in the best position to deliver what it needs to deliver?” It's a people person.

And really thinking about making sure that your engineer's in the right position to deliver the technology, the products that they need to deliver. CTO thinks about technology. Are we building the right technologies? Do we have the right tools? Do we have all of these kind of things? It's such a very different job in my eyes than that of a VP of engineering. Do you guys know Michael Lopp, I think is he well known as the blogger, writes these pieces. If you're a manager, if you think about managing, think in terms of technology management, he's probably sort of the most well-known moderate writer that really thinks deeply about how do you make teams effective? But he's not a CTO. He's a VP of engineering. I think that really embodies [inaudible] wrote books about it as well. Really check out his stuff. Michael Lopp. Rands in Repose I think is the blog.

So really check those things out.

Kyle Corbitt: Great.

So you mentioned earlier that in the early days of Amazon you had those companies integrating with you and they were failing for the infrastructure reasons. Is that where AWS came from? Or tell me, how did the idea for AWS happen? How did that get popular internally?

Werner Vogels: So internally, the Amazon [inaudible] .

They ran AWS as well, now. Are more or less organized in such independent teams and most of those teams look like startups as well. Or they have complete control over their own destination.

And believe me, the recommendation engine for books is very different than the recommendation engine for shoes.

They're have a different team, they have different goals, they have their own innovation agenda all developed by the team themselves, by the way.

So we'd gone through a number of architectural changes. End of the 90s, Amazon's goal was to get big fast.

And they were basically violating all sorts of architectural principles to get to that point.

And that meant it ended up as some sort of monolith and a massive database infrastructure in the back end that was very brittle and basically couldn't grow anymore from an architectural point of view. But remember that nobody had done this before, so they can't be blamed. It's not like you're violating the textbook.

There was no textbook.

So then Amazon moves to what's called a service oriented architecture.

That was not a word that existed around that time either.

So carving off pieces of the monolith, bringing together the data that you operated on, putting an API on it, and then have a network infrastructure that you can call these, what we called services.

And basically, that took two to three years to get that done. Mostly because there was again, no history around how do you run services? So basically, but what we were doing, we were swinging the pendulum all the way to the other end. In this one with the monolith, the whole set of databases were a shared resource and basically the constraint because shared resources are the thing that make you move slower. What we saw, one of the reasons for the changing architecture was that we saw that the effectiveness of engineers was dropping off. Basically deployments were going slower. New features were getting slower, all these kind of things.

And why? Because the back end databases were managed by a group of DBAs, so database administrators.

The DBA cabal.

And to make any schema changes, you had to go through them.

And these guys were responsible for these databases.

So they were as conservative as you can imagine because the reliability of the site depended on them. All that means our effectiveness and innovation was really dropping off. Moving to this new architecture, we created all these things that were going to be independent.

They would have their own data storage.

There's no longer a centralized data storage.

There's no longer a centralized data store, there's no longer single [inaudible] centralized resources, things like that.

So, oh, great. Except for that we made some mistakes there. Okay, so two, three years later we carved off all these pieces.

The monolith is largely gone, all services. Turns out there's a side story. We made a mistake. We had three very large data sets. Customer's items, that's the catalog and orders.

And we basically had taken all the code that operated on that particular data as being one service. Within two years, that was as big as that monolith was. We had to decompose into much smaller functional building blocks. For example, if you talk about the item master, the customer master service that basically consisted of 10 different smaller services. Each with their own unique scaling and reliability, capability. For example, there would be a login service in there that basically is called on every webpage. But in that same piece of software also sat the address book service.

That only is needed when you check out. But that whole thing needed to scale at the scale of the login servers because that was the one that requires more scale.

So decomposing that into different building blocks that each have their unique scaling and reliability and maybe security requirements made that we went to what now is called a microservices architecture. Move forward, all these teams, they're small, they own their piece and then we see the effectiveness of these teams tapering off again. 'Cause what happens is that each of those services now becomes ...

And needs to scale.

They all need to work on the same thing.

They all need to manage load balances, hardware, databases. Each of the teams now is responsible for actually replicating the database of three different data centers.

So, actually all these teams you see the communication between these teams and the networking infrastructure increasing.

There's all these new tickets being created, all this work being done. But they're not working on innovation.

They're not working on keeping the experimental pipeline going.

There was another red flag, and what I realized is that all these teams are doing the same thing. Because we'd thrown the pendulum to that side, that now you had to manage your own database. Dropping actually databases into a shared services platform, dropping storage, dropping networking in there and for example also making an environment where servers no longer were servers but became virtual and you could actually manage them. I think we were really good in those days in terms of hardware provisioning. As an engineer, you would go to a portal, you would fill in what you need.

You need 10 more Linux servers of this particular size, and an hour or two later you would have them. If you can imagine at the end of the year, towards Thanksgiving, spikes are four times as high.

So teams need a lot more hardware. If you then would go talk to them in January and tell them “Why aren't you releasing any capacities?”. “Oh, you know, if there's projects coming up in March.” Then we thought, why don't we just hang onto it? And apparently just an hour to get capacity is not a good enough incentive to release stuff again. We needed to go to mobile first of all where you could take engineers out of the loop.

And, we could have business rules to decide how much capacity is applied to something. Servers needed to become virtual, they needed to get an API, things like that. We built these things for ourselves internally. One look at these companies who were failing on the outside that required scale looked like ... But we solved this for ourselves.

Then starting to think to say some of those technologies, or not the technologies themselves but thinking about how we had built them for internal, then rebuild them on the outside.

The first one we launched was Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service in Spring of 2006. Storage for the internet, is what we called it. Really in the early days thinking that this would be targeted at what I now would call internet scale companies. I don't like to use the word startups because I think there's many other types of businesses that eventually required internet scale.

And that was really where we were pushing for. Storage became the first one, we launched EC2 in the fall of that year. Same kind of mobile and interfaces that we used internally, where suddenly the compute capability became programmable. Within a few months enterprises figured out that this was way too good a deal for them as well, and we know what the story is since then.

Kyle Corbitt: I am curious, I mean at the time as you were developing this, before it was released, did Amazon have a sense ... I mean, it's a dominant product now in the world. It's changed the way developers work at small and large companies. Did you really have that belief coming in, this is going to change the landscape? Or was it just sort of like an iterate every year more people were using it and it just slowly grew into what it is today?

Werner Vogels: I think one of the things that we were, I won't say caught off guard by, is that how fast it grew.

That's definitely. Did we know it was going to be really big? Yes, that was the bet that we were making. On Amazon, there's two types of innovation that happens. One of them is that each team by themselves is in charge of the innovation road map for the coming year. Teams do that for themselves. If they set the recommendation engine for shoes, who has as a metric to reduce the number of returns. Can you recommend? Now, if this Valentinos nine fitted you really well, if you want to buy this Jimmy Choos, maybe do an eight and a half.

This seems silly but doing returns is a tax, it's a customer unfriendly kind of thing.

So the more you can do that.

Those guys are in charge of building a road map for the coming year. How to get new data sources, how to maybe engage with your customers differently.

That's something they make themselves. There's no top down thing, and thou shall do this.

So that's one level of innovation.

The other level is the one that requires significant capital investment.

And that was clearly something that AWS falls into, that particular category.

Things like the Kindle, Amazon Prime, all those are all things that to do that we needed to do significant capital investment.

Then Amazon left a rule that if you do that, if it's going to be successful, it needs to be successful in a way that has significant impact on the Amazon balance sheet. It's not that we're interested in another, let's say, it sounds [inaudible] , but another 50 million dollar opportunity now where if you make this capital investment you need to look for really big opportunities. We knew that if AWS was going to be successful, it was going to be massively successful. In a way that we'd never seen before. We knew that we had to develop lots of new processes and technologies and techniques and whatever for all of this if it was going to be successful. Now, I remember when we were developing S3 we wrote a number on the board, that we thought “Oh, within six months we're probably ... Let's build this for this number of objects in the storage engine.” And then just for the heck of it, we put two orders of magnitude behind it.

Things like, okay. Blew through that in the first three months. Oh. Now suddenly it turns out that some decisions we made early on from a technology point of view were really smart. We knew that with every order of magnitude of growth, you probably need to revisit your architecture that you have.

You need to build software that needs to be able to evolve over time. For example, take a storage engine. If you go to next release internally of your software, you can't just copy the massive amount of petabytes that you have on the other storage discs to do this, no.

You have to live with multiple architectures at the same time, multiple versions, all these kind of things. Fortunately, with all the lessons from Amazon.com, we'd actually taken the right steps there. But there's been some challenges over time in that sense. But I think also, just like with any other company, there's not only the tech that you have to scale. I think early days at AWS I believe we said something like “We don't need any sales people.

This stuff will sell itself.

This is all self service.” Well, turns out, that's not the case. It turns out you need solution architecture, you need technical account managers, you need customer support.

You need all these kind of things to build around your product that have nothing to do with the tech itself. But, you cannot become a successful company without that.

Kyle Corbitt: I was looking just right before this interview actually, and I was looking at the AWS directory page.

And there's I don't know, I think it was like 130 services and probably that number will change, by the time we finish this conversation. I'm curious, how do you as an organization determine ... How do you decide to build something new? Is it a top down process? Is it just an individual team? What does that look like, to launch something new?

Werner Vogels: It works both ways. We expect all of our teams as they are now to be in very close contact with our customers. About 95% of features and services that we deliver are in response to direct requests from our customers.

That's a massive influx, of course the early earliest services that we built, you could almost think about what they should be. I mean, what is the basic IT infrastructure, storage, compute, databases, network, security. I mean, you didn't need customers to actually tell you that. We knew that those were the basic pieces that we needed to build. But pretty quickly, customers came with all sorts of other requests. I mean, if I look at the kind of things that AWS was really good at, at a fundamental level, it is scale, performance, security, reliability, and managing cost.

Those are not products on the outside but those are core capabilities that come back in each and every one of these services. Customers then came to us and said “Well, you know, can't you run analytics for us?” This is the early days, so everything about analytics, around IUT, about mobile development, about these days blockchain, all these other technologies that customers actually want to use, but do not want to manage themselves.

And essentially helping them putting up the right features or tools is important.

And we also had a very strong culture around when we launch new products, new services, we'll launch them with a minimal feature set.

You could call it an MVP. But this is technology that other people need to build their business on.

You can't actually launch things that are flakey, it needs to be rock solid.

So we launch things rock solid but with minimum feature sets and then work with your customers on what should the other features be. Now, in general we don't have an inkling what the other features are going to be. When we launched DynamoDB For example, we really knew customers wanted secondary [NDCs] . We didn't launch with them but that was obvious that that was what they wanted. We mostly launch with minimum feature sets because these are sometimes services nobody else has used before, nobody built. We need to observe your customers, how they're gonna use your product. Because you don't know up front. Actually, they'll probably use it in every possible way except for the one that you intended it to.

That is good because if it didn't launch with everything and the kitchen sink, then you can focus on how your customers are using your product, and then slowly start to iterate and add in new features and services to it in the way that their new modern way of development is working. When we launched Lambda, which is our server-less environment, so basically you just write code, you dump it in S3, and you don't need to think about servers and anything else.

You don't need to think about idle time.

You only have to pay for what you use, things like that. Great environment. Nobody done that before.

So how is development going to change? What's the other support structures around it? Originally, maybe we launched it much more as an event driven environment.

So, a new file arrives in S3, it triggers some code. A new message arrives, it triggers some code, API gateway.

Things like that. But it turns out, some of the companies that actually immediately jumped on board with server-less were some of the largest enterprises. Why? Because you don't need to manage anything and you don't need to pay if no execution happens. I mean, if you run a whole batch of SE2 instances, whether you use them or not, you're being billed for them. And in this case, you're only being billed for execution. It changes the way the development happens.

You don't launch everything and the kitchen sink as I said earlier, around servers, you're gonna see how your customers are using this.

And they quickly start iterating with [inaudible] X ray as being the debugging environment. Deliver step functions to build more complex applications.

And there's a lot more things coming down in that pipeline, mostly because you can observe how your customers are using your product. For example, in DynamoDB we knew secondary indexes. Turns out customers want to draw on item levels access management. Much more important to them than secondary NDCs. Basically, customers reordered our road map.

And then we started delivering the things that mattered most to them. Which, I think is an important part in this. But, again, even though it looks like an MVP we can't treat it like an MVP because people will be building their business on it and they'll be depending on it.

So, it comes with a very different culture structure around it. Last year 1400 new features and services? As the number of teams grow, that of course accelerates as well. We use within AWS the same structure.

The Neptune team. The graph database is supposed to be in contact with their most important customer, or most let's say demanding customers.

And understand what their needs are. Each of these teams has their own customer set and customer base, and all built around road map.

The more services you get, the more road maps you get. But, this is really a very fast moving environment where the way that people are building software changed dramatically as well. If we would have taken the step in deciding for our customers how they should develop software, you probably would have been developing software in let's say the way that five years ago software, or 10 years ago. Because that's the structure you have. Instead of it, we need to start developing software how we would like to develop software in 2020, or 2025.

That's the thinking that we have.

You can't do that by deciding for your customers.

You need to work closely with them and allow them to drive your innovation engine.

Kyle Corbitt: About a decade ago, you wrote a blog post called working backwards.

You remember the one I'm talking about?

Werner Vogels: Yeah.

Kyle Corbitt: I'm curious. Could you describe the product development flow that you put in that post? And then tell me what you learned and whether Amazon still uses that structure.

Werner Vogels: We use it everywhere.

The protocol working from the customer backwards. Amazon, we have a very strong focus on developing only those things that really matter for your customers, where even though we're a technology company, and I think if you're a heavy technology company, lots of engineering, there's a risk that engineers get in charge. If they get in charge, you do not necessarily build products, you build technology. For us there's a big difference between the two. I think what makes AWS, for example, successful, is because we focus on products. Meaning, what do we want to build for our customer? Much more like, oh, this is this very cool storage system that sits underneath there that we've never built before. Or how do we do global tables in DynamoDB? So there's all this amazing tech that we're building but that's not what's driving it. It's what do you want to build for your customer. What is the problem you want to solve? For them. We wanna make sure that, and whether that is in AWS, or whether that is in [inaudible] , or whether this opening a new office in Menlo Park. We use a process called working backwards. Why are we doing this? So the first thing you do, is you write a press release.

And it's not a press release that will go out. It's a press release you write for yourself, where you richly describe in very clear and simple terms exactly what you're going to build.

Then you write a document with let's say the 20 most frequent questions.

And then you have to answer those in very clear and simple terms as well.

Sometimes, especially for more complex situations, we iterate on those first two documents maybe 10 to 15 times. Until it's really absolutely exactly clear what you're going to build.

And not more than that. Then, you write the UX Document, basically how are my customers going to use this? Or what is the interaction with the customer going to be? And then the fourth document is part of the user manual, glossary, and some other terms, things like that. At the end of that, you have a set of four documents that describes exactly what you're going to do.

And then the ruling within Amazon is that and thou shall not be billed more than that. Because, as engineers, and I'm one myself, you have the tendency to sort of ...

Anything that makes it easy for you to build version two, you [inaudible] start putting that in version one.

That's not an option. It's really focusing on building that and exactly only that. It gives us a really strong structure around how to think about customers, how to feel about products, much more about technology.

This is the product you want to build. Now, what kind of technologies do we need for that? There's a very strong product thinking around that. It combines with another process that we have. Meetings at Amazon ... We have a moratorium on using slides. No PowerPoint, no Keynote, nothing like that. Why? Because in meetings, I think slides are deadly. Half of the room will be on their phones, and the other half will be already complaining by slide number two that they don't understand what you're talking about.

That's obvious, because you haven't seen the whole presentation yet. We operate in Amazon with what's called six pagers.

This is a six page document, a narrative that you have to write.

And the first 30 minutes of a meeting will always be spent by reading this document in complete silence.

Sometimes, half way through the reading, you go like “Guys, go back to the drawing board. Don't waste our time here.” Because why? Because it is very important because it's very hard to write a clear document if you do not have clarity of mind. Writing a narrative is extremely hard.

And this might be, there's often a collaborative effort.

You'll write it, you'll give it to some of your colleagues for feedback, you put it in your drawer. A week later, you pick it up again, you revise it until you get to a point where you think you're really clear about describing whether it's a feature, or a product, or an activity, or a new business that you want to go into. After reading those six pages for 30 minutes, everybody in the room is on the same page. No pun intended by the way. Or pun intended, whatever you wanna say.

So no, you get very high quality discussion after that because everybody knows exactly what we're talking about. Now often part of that process is then there's an addendum to the six page will be the PR and FAQ and you'll iterate on those. We have a very unique culture around that.

Kyle Corbitt: Five years ago, virtualization was still pretty new, a lot of companies were just moving to that. Today, everything is being containerized, you have lots of big customers moving to Lambda, to totally server-less platforms. Where do you think development is going to go five years from now? How are we going to be building our apps?

Werner Vogels: If I would have this crystal ball ... I would be sort of ... I do think I see quite a few companies skipping the containers step. More and more. I think some part of the pile of I think what makes containers popular, one thing there is everybody wanted to go to a more microservices environment, and I think that maps really well with container technologies. We can scale things up and down easily in the single components that you have. I think that matches the microservices thinking really well. I think most of the people that actually come into that phase often come out of the monolith phase, breaking up the monolith into those containers. People that start from scratch, more and more develop around server-less environments.

You could even consider, at AWS, two container products. One is ECS, that's a container service, it's all around Docker and Docker capabilities and things like that.

And deep integration for all the database services and then there's EKS which is managed [inaudible] beneath the service.

That's how we started off. The thing with containers, is especially before we deliver the Fargate and I'll talk about it in a minute, is that basically it almost brings you back to the pre-Cloud days. Suddenly, you need to manage multiple containers over multiple availability zones.

There's almost so much that you need to map them onto virtual machines. Because these things don't run by themselves.

You still need to manage the whole virtual machine environment underneath there. Even though containers is a great development abstraction, customers need to do a lot of work to run those containers.

So part of that will be taken care of because it's a managed service. But we also delivered something called Fargate. Fargate basically takes away all the management of virtual machines underneath there.

So basically, just write a container, you drop it in there, it runs. Kind of.

That's the state where you want to be in. Now, I think every time when you need to do things that actually have nothing to do with building your product, or running your product, in most efficient way, then that's sort of a waste of effort. We continue to look at how can we take more and more of those pain points away? Because you know what, nobody cares who are running containers. Nobody cared about the virtual machines underneath there. It's just the tax that you had to pay.

And I think we're sort of bringing up especially I think the interaction in the [inaudible] group is really feeding many things back into the mainstream [inaudible] open source environment. Especially when it comes to things like security and things like that. How are we doing things differently five years ... Oh that was the question. Yeah, I think there's a lot more server-less development because I think we see already an enormous pick up in and around that. I think we'll see more and more tools and support platforms and infrastructure around the ability to build more complex server-less environments. Better integration I think with other services, that's definitely things that we'll see. But I want to shift to something else. I think one thing that we will be doing, I hope, five years from now is that everybody will be taking security as their number one job. Whether you're the CEO, whether the CTO, whether you're an engineer, we all need to become security conscious and we all need to become security engineers. I think if you've looked at the past four or five years, I mean there isn't a week that goes by where there is not some massive data breach. Yeah? It's embarrassing. I think us as technologists and as digital business leaders, we should be embarrassed. But we are not. Where's the outrage? We almost seem to accept this as being sort of part of our ... It's not.

You know? Without protecting your customers, you have no business.

And I think this is something that maybe as a young business as a startup, you didn't think about 10 years ago, or five years ago. Where, I think everybody needs to start with thinking about, oh this is the kind of data I'm collecting from my customers, how am I protecting my customers? And you may say, “Oh, who is interested in when Werner rented this bike here?” Well, you know, that dataset plus two other [inaudible] datasets that you may get from other places may have a very valuable position for ... I think we all need to become extremely security conscious and make sure that we can continue to protect our customers. It would be embarrassing I think as young businesses to actually start losing your data of your customers. It will impact everybody else in your environment. Not just as customers, but it will reflect on other young businesses as well. I think, if you collect data off your customers, if you have consumer data, you have a grave responsibility to keep that data secure.

And you know, there's also tools for it.

There's encryption and really give you dozens of different tools that all can help you do this. But, you need to keep it in your mind that that's your first and foremost job. Of course, you're all thinking “Yeah, but we don't know. We're building this new service. We're building this new consumer service. We don't think ...” No, I think the only way if you actually build your new business without security in mind, it will be very hard to retrofit it into it.

You will have a nightmare, let's say two, three years down the road when you become successful and you grow and you need to retrofit security? You're gonna be in a major mess. It means also that your development processes, because that's what you asked about, need to change. Security needs to become a default part of your for example, your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. It needs to trigger events. Whenever you're building something and someone adds a new open source library to it, an alarm should be going off with someone to inspect why are we adding this? Why are we doing this? Did we check this out from a security point of view? Your development pipeline itself needs to be secure, there needs to be all sorts of alarms going off in that whole section, and security needs to become your first and foremost concern.

And there's lots of automation tools around it. So you deploy, you can use Amazon Inspector to test about all sorts of vulnerabilities but if you do continuous integration, and continuous deployment, especially if you for example you [inaudible] or in health care.

You're subject to all sorts of regulatory requirements. How do you know that this new next five lines of code, that you just wrote, don't violate your HIPAA? Or, that you're still in compliance with whatever the financial regulator wants from you. We have all sorts of automation tools that can continuously test this for you but you do need to do it.

And it needs to be in your mind.

So, development, especially if it continues deployment changes radically from how we've been approaching security in the past. Now, I honestly believe continuous deployment actually is better from a security point of view. Because in the past, you would write 50,000 lines of code, security team would come in, would review it, would bless it, and they had no clue what they were doing. Would bless it, 50,000 lines of code, you have no idea.

And you would deploy it. Changing five lines of code? Is something that you can actually test with automated processes, automatic reasoning and things like that, that you actually are building the right thing. I think it is great advances for security, we do need to keep security in our mind. I hope that in five years time, not necessarily we're all security engineers, but we're all super security conscious and protecting our customers will be our first concern. It is at Amazon. It will be forever our number one investment area, both in terms of intellectual capital, as well as in financial capital. Without protecting your customers you do not have a business.

Kyle Corbitt: Beyond not taking security seriously enough, are there any other common mistakes or errors you see startups doing as they use AWS?

Werner Vogels: Well, first and foremost I think there's a technical one. We've got quite a few people that are for the first time AWS users but that have already had experiences, let's say building services and using a traditional data center. Using AWS as a data center makes that you lose out. I think, yeah there're some advantages to it, you have some elasticity and things like that that you can make use of but if you don't use the higher level services around security, around data analytics, around mobile, all of these where we take away a lot of the development for a lot of the hard, let's say the heavy lifting.

You're losing out. If you just treat it as a data center with just some virtual machines and databases and storage, that's not where your major productivity improvements are going to come from.

Some, but not the major ones. Next to that, more of a meta level, you have to figure out what kind of company you are.

And I think there's two different companies, two different styles. One of them is you go for the high grow, get big fast kind of thing. Acquire as many customers as possible, as quickly as possible, not necessarily thinking that much about revenue, taking lots of investors money and really get big really fast to become successful and then probably be acquired. 'Cause that's why people invest in you.

That makes your use of AWS and your use of Cloud very different from if you're ...

And we support that really well. Because you don't have to worry that much about getting capacity, or services, whatever. It's all there.

And it comes with a clear cost picture as well, that's different. Or, if you want to become a sustainable company. Basically, I want to build this company but still be in business 30 years from now. Not necessarily focused on acquisition but just building a business. I think if you guys follow Signal V. Noise, the guys from Basecamp, DHH and others and Jason [inaudible] talk a lot about how they wanna be in business still.

They want to still do this business 10, 20 years from now. How do they do that? And that requires different architectures, it requires much more control of cost, it requires a clear association between cost and customer acquisition, so AWS supports that as well but it requires you to build very different architectures. Because you want much more control of cost and scale, than in the other one where you're not that much concerned about cost, but you're much more concerned about can we change really fast so we can address our customer concerns because we need to grow really fast. Jeff often makes the distinction between mercenaries and missionaries. Mercenaries are the startup founders that are in it for the money.

And missionaries are the ones that are in it for the love of the product. I want to build this product. Or I want to build this business.

And you support both, they're both valid.

They're both valid approaches to entrepreneurship. It's just that the tech support and the tech that you build for these different groups is very very different. So, figure out what you are.

Kyle Corbitt: Alright, well thank you so much.

This has been wonderful and we've learned so much. And everyone, a big thanks to Dr. Werner Vogels.
