# Understanding SAFEs and Priced Equity Rounds by Kirsty Nathoo

Geoff Ralston: I would like to introduce Kirsty, who is going to talk, in much detail about  safes, notes, equity and the like. Kirsty.

Kirsty Nathoo: All right, good morning everybody. So my name is Kirsty Nathoo. I'm the CFO, one  of the partners here at YCombinator and I have now worked with probably over 1500  companies in terms of getting them incorporated, doing a YC investments and then seeing them  through their subsequent raises, either on convertible instruments or on equity rounds. I've seen kind  of a lot by now, and so this presentation is to give you some understanding  of some of the things that people don't necessarily understand when they're raising money and  to hopefully help you avoid some of the pitfalls that we've seen with ... Some  of the mistakes that we've seen founders make.

The key message in all of this  presentation is that it's important that you understand at all stages of the company's life  cycle, how much of the company you've sold to investors, and in connection with that,  how much therefore, you also own.

The thing that makes this complicated is that most  companies will raise money on convertible instruments first, and because those convertible instruments aren't yet  shares, is not immediately obvious for a lot of founders, how much of the company  they've sold. I'm going to talk through some of the mechanics of that and help  you understand how all that works, so that you don't get surprised when it's too  late and you can't do anything about it.

The other thing that you should also  be aware of is that a lot of companies and a lot of founders will  just say, "Oh, I don't need to worry about my cap table. My lawyers deal  with my cap table. I don't need to worry." Actually, that's a really dangerous statements.  Again, you should make sure that you're understanding this. It's your responsibility as the CEO  or the founder of the company to understand all of this.

There's lots of ways  that you can maintain your cap table.

There's lots of ways that you can keep  track of this, and the simplest form is just a spreadsheet. All it's going to  show us who owns how many shares and that's it. That's all you need at  the beginning, but there are other services out there that can help. I'll, include them  on a list of, of resources after the presentation, but there's tools like captable.io and  Carter, which also help for you to keep track of these things.

These are the  three sections that I'm going to talk about. First of all, I'm going to talk  about safes. Particularly for US companies. Most companies will raise money first on safes or  some other convertible instruments, which I will talk about briefly as well.

And I know  Jeff mentioned the safe last week in a little bit of detail, but I'm going  to go into much more detail on that and also how the sections of the  safe works.

The S stands for simple and so hopefully you will believe me with  that, and you will be ready to understand what's going on in that safe as  you come out of this presentation.

Then we'll talk some more about dilution again so  that you can see we're going to walk through the lifecycle of a company from  incorporation up to raising a priced series all round, so that you can see how  things change over that period.

And then I'll give you some top tips on other,  other items to do with raising money. All right, so first of all the safe.  So let's cover what it is and then we'll go through the details of how  a safe is built up. As I said, safe, the S stands for simple, the  rest of it is a Simple Agreement for Future Equity and put simply, it's a  instrument where the investor will give you money, now, in exchange for a promise from  the company to give shares to the investor at a future date, when you raise  money on a priced round, There are minimal negotiations with a safe. Really, there's only  two things that you probably going to negotiate with the investor, which is how much  money you going to ... How much money the investor will put into the company  and at what valuation cap. Really those two things are the things to negotiate, whereas  when you compare that with a priced round, there's a whole raft of things to  negotiate, and that's what makes the priced round a lot harder to close and to  raise money on them than a safe does. That's why often companies will start with  a safe and then when they get to the point of being able to raise  more money, and they have a lead investor, which that negotiate with for the priced  round, then the safes, when they convert into shares, will piggyback on the terms that  has been negotiated with the lead investor in the priced round.

The other thing to  bear in mind is that a safe is not debt. Some of you will have  raised on what's known as convertible debt. That's a different instrument. Debt has generally an  interest rate attached to it and it has a maturity date, where the debt needs  to be repaid. Safes have neither of those things. So it's important to understand that  there is a distinction between the two instruments, but in terms of conversion, in the  way that they convert in a priced round, there are some similarities. This is the  first section in the safe and this paragraph, actually includes pretty much all the key  details that you need to understand in a safe. It talks about in exchange for  payment by investor, you're going to be investors putting in a certain amount of dollars  around the date and down here, the valuation cap is some number. Really those two  blanks are the two negotiating points. This paragraph here is something that we've added just  recently in our newest version of safes and this is something that will hopefully help  you so that once you've read our safe that we have available on our website,  once. If there's this paragraph on the safe, then you know that you have read  the safe.

The idea behind this is that if anything changes in the safe, either  the company or the investor cannot say this paragraph. It can't say that it's the  same as the safe that's on the YCombinator website, and so you'll know as a  founder that you should be looking at it more closely to see what's been changed.  This is just something to keep your eyes open for if you receive a safe  from an investor. Okay. So the anatomy of the safe is pretty straightforward. It's only  five pages in length, so it's not very long. We tried really hard to keep  the language not too legal, so it's easy to understand and really it split into  five sections. Section one talks about what happens in a various different sets of events.  Most of the time what's going to happen is there will be an equity financing  at some point in the future, and so the first part of the section talks  about what happens then, how does the safe convert? Or there might be a liquidity  event, either the company might get sold before the safe converts. So it's also addresses  what happens if the company is sold whilst the safest still outstanding. Or the company  might decide to close down whilst the safe still outstanding, so it also addresses that.  Those are the three real key events that might drive change from the safe, so  it addresses all of those. Often we get questions from founders or from investors saying,  "But what happens if?" Actually these three sections are the answers to pretty much all  of those questions.

Then there's a couple of other sections where we clarified the liquidation  priority, which just means who comes first in the queue to be repaid in these  different situations. Also clarifying that the safe actually terminates; i.e, it does no longer exist  if any of the top three events happen. So that section is kind of your  instruction booklet. If something happens in your company, that's the section you look at to  see what happens to your safe.

Then the next section, section two is just the  definition section. So anything that we referred to within the safe will be explained in  section two. If you're not sure what the company capitalization definition is, you go to  section two to look at that for an explanation. Section three are the representations that  the company makes to the investor. So it's saying things like the company is duly  formed. It's correctly formed in Delaware. Section four is the representations that the investors make  to the company. So it's things like the investor saying, "Yes, I agree I'm an  accredited investor." Then section five is kind of legal boiler plate language that needs to  be in there. Really from your point of view, the sections that you really need  to understand are sections one and sections two. Obviously you need to know what you're  representing in section three as well, but those section one and section two, are the  key key parts, and that bit is only three pages long of the safe. I'm  pretty sure you can all read three pages and understand what's going on. I encourage  you to do that. Some of you may have heard, in the last couple of  weeks, we announced to move to a different type of safe. We've introduced concept of  post money safes, and it's important that we understand what post money means. What it  basically means is after all the safes have converted, what happens at that point, and  we'll go into that in a little bit more detail in a moment, but it's  easy to get confused about what post money means here, but it's after all the  safes.

The reason why we introduced these is that we wanted to make it easier  for founders to understand the dilution that they were taking; i.e, how much of the  company they'd sold to investors and so how much less of the company they owned.  It's a lot easier to to understand that with post money safes than with the  previous safes that we had, which were known as pre money safes. Basically, when we're  talking about pre money and post money, we're talking about the same thing. It's just  a different way to express it, to explain it. In both a priced round done  for safes, the formula stays the same. So the pre money valuation plus the amounts  of money raised, equals the post money valuation of the company. So if you have  a $5 million pre money valuation and you raise a $1 million, then the post  money valuation of the company is $6 million. That's important to remember in a moment,  but really, that's as simple as it gets.

Then based on that, so that you  can understand how much of the company you sold when you're raising money on safes.  The formula is just your ownership or the ownership of the investors, the ownership that  the investors will take, is their amount raised divided by the post money evaluation in  the case of a priced round or valuation cap in the case of a safe.  So in our example before, if the investors we're putting in $1 million and the  post money valuation was $6 million, then they will own 16.67% of the company. Does  that all make sense to everybody? So far? Okay, good. I'm going to talk only  about safes with valuation caps here to keep things simple, but just be aware that  there are other different flavors of safes that you can use and that you may  have already used or that you may find that you use in future. So the,  maybe the concept of a discount instead of a cap. Instead of capping the valuation  that say $6 million, it says, there's a, there's a 20% discount on the series  a price.

There's also an uncapped safe, which basically just says, "I'm going to put  money in now as an investor, and when you do a priced round, I'll get  the same price as the priced round investors are going to get." That's pretty uncommon  because the investors who are putting in money early, want some kind of bonus for  putting in the money early. It's pretty unlikely that you'll, you'll use one of those.  Then finally there's a safe uncapped with a most favored nation clause, which basically what  that says is, "I'm not going to agree a cap right now, but if you  raise some money from some other investors, who do have a cap and that's how  those terms are better than my terms, I get their terms as well as an  investor." This one can sometimes happen if you're raising money very early on and you  don't really know what the cap is and maybe you just want to punt it  for another month or two, but it just creates a little bit more admin for  the founders because it's another thing that they have to keep track of. We see  them sometimes, again, not all that common. By far the most common is just the  valuation cap only. All right, so now we understand safes and how they're made up.  We're going to talk about dilution and understanding how your cap tables work. All right,  so we're going to walk through this process. So we're going to start with our  company, its incorporation, which Carolyn talked about right at the start of the startup school  course I believe. So hopefully this will not be anything new to you.

Then we're  going to talk about what happens when you raise money on safes, some post money  safes.

Then we're going to talk about what happens as you hire people and start  to issue equity to employees, and then the company is going to do a price  round, and so what happens to the cap table at that point? Now I'll warn  you, this is starting to get into the math section of the whole thing, so  turn your brains on and keep concentrating. All right, so incorporation. So let's just assume  it's a really simple company.

There's two founders and they split their shares equally between  the two of them. So in this example, each founder owns 4.625 million shares. So  there's a total of 9.25 million shares issued, and each founder owns 50%. That's pretty  straightforward, right? At this point, in order for them to own those shares, the founders  have done the paperwork, they've granted those shares through a restricted stock purchase agreement and  this vesting on those shares, as was talked about with Carolyn earlier in the course.  Then the next thing that's going to happen is this company raises some money on  a post money safe and they raised from two investors.

The first investor comes in  quite early and they put in $200,000 at a $4 million post money valuation cap.  Then a little bit later on investor B comes in, puts in 800,000 at an  $8 million post money valuation cap. So if you remember back to our formulas, the  ownership that investor A has at this point, is there amounts of money that they've  put in divided by the post money valuation cap, which gives them 5% of the  company. Same for investor B, 800,000, over 8 million, which gives them 10% of the  company. So in total, the founders at this stage have sold 15% of the company.  So even though this doesn't change the actual cap table, because these aren't shares at  this point, this is just a safe. This is just a promise to give shares  in future.

The founders should know at this stage that they have sold 15% of  the company, and if they sold 15% of the company, then they can no longer  own 100% of the company. Now instead of the foam does owning 100% of the  company, between them, they've been diluted by the 15%. So they're going down to 85%  of the company. It's important to have that in your brain when you're raising money,  because whilst the cap table, like I say, doesn't change, the fact that you've just  sold 15% of the company, is an important fact. It's an important thing to know  because you want to make sure that you're not selling too much of the company,  because you know that there's a lot of future fundraisings that are going to happen  with the company.

Therefore there's going to be more future dilution. Is everyone happy with  how we've got to that 15%? Yes.

The question.

Audience: The founders are the only ones getting diluted at this point, earlier investor doesn't get  there?

Kirsty Nathoo: Right. So the question is this, it's only the founders that are being diluted at  the moment and, yes, that's exactly right because that's the construct of the pot money  safes.

The later safe investors don't dilute the earliest safe investors. It just dilute the  existing shareholders, and at this stage, it's just the founders who are the existing shareholders.

Audience: Does it make sense to buy shares in the treasury so that they can anticipate  a dilution?

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So the question is, does it make sense to have shares authorized [inaudible] I  think is what you mean. At this stage it doesn't necessarily make a difference as  you'll see in a moment. You actually create new shares that you're going to issue  to these safe holders when they convert. At this stage is, it's fine to just  have the shares that the founders have and maybe some that you want to give  out for hiring,

Audience: Why investing, he has different post money valuation cap?

Kirsty Nathoo: So the question is why do they have different post money valuation caps? In this  example, it could be for very any number of reasons, but in this example, we're  assuming that, this one happened maybe a month after incorporation and maybe this one happened  six months after incorporation and more has gone on in the company and so it's  slightly less risk and so the company has been able to negotiate a different cap.  Things changed through the company and it's totally fine to have different caps because as  you can see from here, you just calculate everything separately and then add it all  together. So companies raised a million dollars. First thing is probably going to do with  that money is hire some people and when you hire employees, you're probably going to  give them some equity. In this example, the company creates, at this stage a option  pool, otherwise known as an ESOP or an employee incentive plan.

There's lots of different  names for it. In this example, they have created a plan or a pool that  has 750,000 shares in it and they've issued out of their 650,000 shares to early  employees. This has now changed cap table because they've issued shares.

The fact that, that  this more shares being being issued means that the cap table changes because we now  have more shareholders. Now we have a total of 10 million shares that have been  ... Fully diluted basically means the combination of issued and set aside in the option  pool in this case. So now we have our founder's, instead of owning 100%, have  92.5% of the company, and the option plan in total is 7.5% of the company.  But remember those safes.

These founders don't actually have 92.5% because they have also sold  15% of the company. Actually, they own less than the 92.5%.

They actually own 85%  of that, which is about 78.6%. So again, this is where it gets dangerous for  the founders. If they forget about the safes, the founders are sitting there saying, "Well,  I own 92.5%, this is great. I own still loads of the company," and they  have forgotten about the safes and the dilution they're about to take from that. Again,  it's really important to keep track of how much you've sold on your safes so  that you can do that calculation and say, "Actually, I don't have 92.5%, I have  85% of that because I've sold 15% of the company," but is also these numbers  have been diluted by those safes as well. As you'll see in a moment, these  numbers change as well. Now we go into fast forward about let's say a year.  The company is doing well, it's raised the priced round and it has a term  sheet for the priced round, which says that the pre money valuation of the round  is $15 million and they're going to raise a total of $5 million of which  the lead investor, which is the investor that they do all of the negotiations with,  is going to invest $4 million. If you remember from our formula at the start,  the post money valuation is the pre money valuation plus the total raise. So the  Post money valuation is $20 million.

The other thing that gets negotiated as part of  the priced round is the option pool increase. So generally what happens is that the  investors in the series A will say, "Okay, we're going to put some money in.  We know that this money is going to go towards hiring. So we want you  to create an option pool for all the new employees that you're going to employ  and give equity to, in advance, so that it's sitting there ready for those employees."  Usually you see that the option pool is about 10%; might go up to about  15%, but anything more than that is, is fairly nonstandard. Yes. Where did that come  from? Oh over there, okay. Yes.

Audience: [inaudible] .

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is, is the 10% coming from founders or collectively, and you'll see in  a moment is going to dilute the existing shareholders and the safe holders, but it  doesn't dilute the new money.

Audience: How is the option pool represented of the cap table? Is it represented on the  cap table or what form does it take?

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how is the option pool represented on the cap table? So if  we go back to here, we just show it so that we have the options  available from the pool that haven't been issued is a line, and anything that has  been issued from the pool is a separate line.

The reason why we show those  two things separately is that these shares are considered outstanding, they're considered issued whereas these  aren't, and so that's the difference between what ... That's what fully diluted means. It  means outstanding shares, which are these two lines, plus any shares reserved under the option  pool. All right. Where are we? Quick math question for, for you, what do we  expect that the lead investor will own? What percentage of the company do we think  the lead investor is going to own after the round closes?

Audience: 20?

Kirsty Nathoo: 20%, yeah, for the lead investor, 25% in total for all of the series A  investors.

The lead investor is going to put in $4 million divided by $20 million,  gives 20%. So you'll see in a minute, the cap table that that all works  through in the calculations, but it's always good to just do that quick check, so  that you can sense check what's going on in your cap table. All right, so  in a priced round where you have a weather company has raised money just on  post money safes and then has raised a priced round, three things will happen, and  these three things happen at the same time in terms of the documents, but in  terms of the calculations, it's important that the order is correct.

The three things with  post money safes is that the first thing that happens is the safes convert into  shares.

Then an options pool is increased or created if there isn't one already, and  then the new investors invest. You'll see in a minute how that all works through  with the calculations. Now, one other thing that starts to get a little bit confusing  here is one of the sort of the lingo of how this works is this  often the lawyers and the founders will talk about the safes being included in the  pre money, and what that's basically saying is that when the new investors invest, and  they calculate their price per share, the calculation includes the shares from the conversion of  the safes. So even though the safes themselves are referred to as post money safes,  that's talking about how the safes convert. This sentence where the safes are included in  the pre money is talking about how the series A price is calculated. It gets  a little bit confusing because it's talking about post money and pre money, but that's  just something to bear in mind when this happens. Obviously, at the time that you're  raising price round, you're going to have a lot of advisors. You're going to be  working with lawyers who can explain all of this to you as well. All right,  let's go through these three steps then.

The first step is our safes are going  to convert, and we already know because we've already done the calculation that these safes  are going to convert into 15% of the company. 15% of the company means 15%  of the total, fully diluted shares; both common shares and preferred shares. Investors get preferred  shares which have a different set of rights and privileges than the common shares, which  is what the founders and employees get. We have enough information here in the cap  table that we have here to calculate what the actual number of shares are here  because we know that they're going to be 15% of the total issued shares. So  we know that this is 85% of the total issued shares. So we know what  our total is, and then once we get the totals, we can work out what  5% of that is and what 10% of that is. After a bit of algebra,  these are the numbers that come through. Now at this point, we have 11,764,705 shares  in total because it's preferred shares plus common shares. Our first safe investor who we  said was going to have 5%, has 588,000 shares, which represents 5% of that 11.7  million. Our second safe investor has 10%. Now, it's important to remember that this is  partway through a whole process. It's part way through those three steps that are happening  in a priced round. Actually you never going to see your cap table looking like  this. This is just one step in the calculation, but it's just a breakout so  that you can see where that 15% has come from. You can also see here  that when we were saying that the founders, instead of owning I'm 92.5%, they owned  about 78%. You can see that here because they'd been diluted by that 15%, as  have the employees with their options. This is the post money part of the post  money safes, after the safes have converted, but before anything else has happened in relation  to the priced round. Got it? Okay. All right, so the next step is ...  Oh, we have a question. Okay.

Audience: The percentage of ... If you can go back.

The 5%, 10%, that has manged  to be there [inaudible] ?

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is, does the 5% and 10% have any ...

Audience: Like the [inaudible] .

Kirsty Nathoo: The 5% and 10% is based on the valuation cap in the safe, and so  assuming the priced round valuation is higher than the valuation cap in the safe, then  this is just looked at with reference to the safe, and it's just connected to  the existing shareholders. If in the very rare circumstances that the priced round is lower  than the valuation cap on the safe, then actually, the safe investors will get a  better deal because they will sell their share.

Their safes will convert at the same  price that the series A investors have, which is a lower price than the valuation  cap. So actually there is the potential that this can go up. This percentage can  be higher if the priced round is valued at a lower price than the cap  on the safe.

Audience: [inaudible] .

Kirsty Nathoo: It still triggers the conversion even if the valuation's lower because it's the fact that  they've raised money that triggers the conversion, not the price, so it's just something to  bear in mind that when we talking about this, the post money safes and in  this example, that you're selling 15% of the company, there is potential that it could  be higher, but it's a pretty rare situation where you raise a priced round that's  priced lower than the valuation of your safes. It's also something to bear in mind  of trying not to negotiate too hard on the safes to make your caps too  high because if you raise money on $100 million cap, but then you can only  raise money on a $25 million dollar priced round, let's say, then you're actually selling  more of the company to those safe holders than you expected.

Audience: If the founders had convertible debt at this point in time [inaudible]

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So the question is if there's convertible debt, so this would happen here as  well.

The calculation for convertible debt is slightly different, but it would happen in here  and you would show them just as other investors because they would be converting into  shares in relation to the priced round as well.

Audience: What if you went crazy and actually sold 85% of your company and the valuation  is lower at the end. What happens? Can you share on that?

Kirsty Nathoo: Well, so that's the big question. So the question is what happens if you go  crazy and sell 85% of your company? That's the problem.

The founders can raise too  much money on too low valuation caps when they're raising on convertible instruments.

They don't  realize how much dilution they're taking and then they get to that priced round and  they look at the cap table and they're just like, "What? I only own 10%  of the company now," and unfortunately there's not a huge amount you can do at  that point because you've already entered into the contracts with the investors to do this.  That's why it's important to not get into that situation in the first place.

Audience: [inaudible]

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how the cap works in relation to the priced rounds. If the  priced round is higher than the cap, then the safe converts at the cap, which  means that the safe holders basically get more shares for the same amount of money  than the series A investors get. In that situation, that's how, you know, what percentage  you're selling. In the situation where the cap is higher than the priced round, it  wouldn't be fair to the safe holders to have them getting a worse deal than  the series A investors, because they put money in earlier. What happens then is that  the calculation, if you remember good, if you go back to the section one of  the safe, where it says what's happens in a priced equity round situation, it says,  if the cap is higher than the priced round, then they just used the priced  round price to calculate their shares, and so because that priced round price is different,  these numbers will go up.

Audience: But you don't lose much, right? The founders don't lose much?

Kirsty Nathoo: Well it depends. It depends on the delta. If it's only a little bit different,  then yeah, maybe instead of 15%, they've sold 16% let's say. If the delta is  really big, then it could go up, but again, it's something to be aware of.  It's in the current environment, it's pretty unlikely that people raise priced rounds at lower  valuations than their safes, just because when you're raising money on safes, the investors won't  agree to invest at a ridiculously high valuation because they want to get that bonus  of the lower price when their safes convert. Let's keep going. All right, so this  step you're going to have to trust me on.

The next step in the section  is that the option pool is increased and this is actually quite a complicated calculation.  It gets a little bit circular and I'm going to be sharing a model with  everybody so that you can see how this works if you're interested, but basically what  you're trying to do is to get to 10% of the post money shares, are  sitting available in the option pool. In this example, we're going to increase our option  pool by 1.695 million, and you'll see in a minute that that flows through into  the cap table and you'll see that 10%. But just trust me on this one  because this is quite a complicated calculation.

Then step three, the new money invests. This  is where we have our series A investors putting in $5 million, and there's a  couple of calculations that happen in there.

The price per share, that's calculated for the  round is the valuation divided by the capital capitalization. So this is the pre money  valuation, $15 million. When we talking about capitalization here, what we're meaning is this is  the total fully diluted shares after the safe conversion and the option pool increase. So  that's why this is step three because our safes have converted and our option pool  is increased. We have our 10 million shares that we'd issued, 9.25 to the founders,  725,000 in the options pool, plus the safe conversion shares, plus the increase in the  options pool and you'll see the numbers in a moment. So then the number of  shares that the series A investors get is the amount they're investing divided by their  price per share. So those are the three calculations that you need to remember for  your series A. Here we go. Here are all those calculations. We're saying that the  capitalization, we have our 10 million shares that were already issued. We have our 1.76  million shares from the conversion of the safes, and we have our increased to the  option pool of 1.695 million. So that gives us 13.5 million total shares. We divide  off $15 million, buy those shares to get a new money price. So this is  the price that the investors will pay for their shares of $1.114. So that means  that the $5 million of new money that's coming in, will buy 4.48 million shares  and the lead investor, because they're putting in 4 million, will get 3.59 million of  those shares.

These are the calculations that get worked through. This is what the cap  table, then looks like post money. So this is now everything's been done in the  round. So we've still got our founders, we've still go sour options. Those numbers haven't  changed. This number's changed because it's increased by 1.695 million. You can see here that  now this is 10% of the total shares, which is what we were targeting because  that was agreed in the time sheet. We have our safe investors who the number  of shares haven't changed because we'd already done that calculation for the conversion, but their  percentages have changed. It's gone down a little bit, and the reason why those have  gone down is because the safe investors have been diluted by the series A money  and by the increase in the options pool.

Then we have a lead investor in  our other investors, in our series A. As you remember when we did the quick  back of envelope calculation of the point of guessing the term sheet, our lead investor  owns 20%, our other investors own 5%. So in total they have 25%.

The founders  up here now own 51.5%, which is a big jump from the cap table that  they originally were looking at, where they owned a 92.5%, and that's where this gets  complicated. If you don't understand your dilution, you don't understand how much of the company  that you've sold. When you get to this point and you look at the cap  table and you're saying, "Oh no, I only own 30% of the company, how did  that happen?" There isn't a lot you can do because most of that dilution has  already happened because you've raised money on safes and so that's why it's super important  that you keep track of this dilution because at this point, there isn't a lot  you can do about it. All right. Moving on, so a couple of top tips  for you. We've mentioned briefly about convertible notes and that's just another instrument that you  can use to raise money in the early days. Often we find companies outside of  the US will raise money on convertible debt.

There's nothing wrong with it. It is  a little bit more complex just because you have to deal with interest that accrues  on it and maturity dates, but companies deal with that. What I would say is  try not to have a combination of safes and convertible notes, just because it makes  things a little bit more complicated in the calculations. So if you start raising on  debt, then probably stick with it, but ideally, start with safe because it's actually making  your lives a little bit easier. Again, we're now recommending that companies use post money  safes, but there are pre money safes available and some of you may have already  raised on pre money safes. That's totally fine. It just makes it a little bit  more complicated to understand dilution, but you can still do the same back of envelope  calculation to get a ballpark figure, even though it's not exactly accurate. If you have  raised money on pre money safes, then it's fine to come to in future raise  money on post money safes.

The calculations just gets a little bit complex, but it's  totally doable. So that's fine, don't panic. Would suggest that you probably move on to  post money safes even if you've raised money on pre money safes, just so that  you can keep track of your future dilution. A quick word on optimization in all  of this, when you're raising money on safes, don't try to over optimize for the  cap. It gets really easy to start seeing this as a competition, and you start  talking to your friends and you start saying, "Well, I've raised money on a $6  million cap," and they say, "Well, I've got an $8 million cap and so I'm  more successful than you are." As Jeff mentioned last week, fundraising is not the be  all and end all. It's a means to an end. Don't try to over optimize.  Don't try to push this up too far because you're negotiating with investors who do  this all day and every day and you're probably not somebody who negotiates this all  day and every day. Actually, when I run the numbers on the calculation that we've  just been through, if we'd have changed that 800,000 that was raised on an $8  million cap to a $10 million cap, the ownership at the close, for the founders,  would have been 52.7% rather than 51.5. It's not actually a huge difference, especially if  you have two or three or four founders, co-founders and the extra pain for negotiating  that $2 million cap is probably not worth it. Just take the money, do what  you need to do with the money and made the company a success instead. In  conclusion, use post money safes where you can, hopefully all of you can use those  going forward. Understand what you're selling with the company, so make sure that you keep  track of your dilution, and understand where the company is being sold. Finally, again, don't  over optimize for valuation caps because it doesn't actually make as much difference as you  think it's going to make. So we have a couple of minutes for some more  questions.

Audience: [inaudible] .

Kirsty Nathoo: Sorry, repeat is the question, do you care about [inaudible] ?

Audience: [inaudible]

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is don't you care more about voting power and that's definitely something that  gets negotiated as part of the series A term sheet. Where the voting power tends  to come from in here is the composition of the board and so generally, you  want to keep the founders having majority of the board and so often at series  A, what you'll find is that this ... If there's two founders in the company,  you'll have two founders on the board and you'll have a representative of the lead  investor on the board.

The founders still have the majority and that's really where the  voting power comes from.

Audience: How important is to find the lead investor and how should one approach [inaudible] ?

Kirsty Nathoo: The question is how important is a lead investor? When you're raising money on safes,  you don't necessarily need a lead investor.

The beauty of the safes is that as  soon as somebody agrees to invest in your company, you can say, "Great, here's the  safe, sign it, and give me my money." Even if that's only a small amount  of money, that doesn't matter as long as you've negotiated how much they're putting in,  and what the valuation cap is. So for safes, it doesn't matter at all that  you don't have a lead investor. At the priced round stage, it is important that  you have a lead investor because there's so much to negotiate that you don't want  to be negotiating with a bunch of people. You want to negotiate with one pers  ... Oh, well one investor who is, is setting out the terms because they're putting  in, in this example, $4 million after the five, and then everyone else gets pulled  along with those same terms.

Audience: What is the maximum amount that you should give up [inaudible]

Kirsty Nathoo: Great question.

The question was, what's the maximum amount that you should give up for  in a seed round or a safe round? If we just quickly go back to  this. This is actually a fairly standard cap table that we'd expect to see, where  the founders own just over 50%. We see that in the vast majority of cases  coming out of a series A priced round. If you think about it, these numbers  are set. Generally, in pretty much any series A around, the lead investor is going  to want around 20%, and the total amount sold of the company is going to  be around 25%.

The option pool is going to be around 10% post money, so  that's already 35%. So then really all you have to play with is what the  safe investors get to drive what the founder's own. So the more you sell to  the safe investors, the less the founders are going to own. In this example where  we were selling 15% of the company, that's probably about the range that you want  to be looking at. Obviously every company has a different circumstance, and getting some money  in less good terms is better than getting no money in it at all.

There's  always discretion that has to be made, but yeah, this is a fairly standard cap  table about 15% on safes, about 25 to the lead ... To the series A  investors, and about 10% options pool with the rest of the founders. One more question  and then we've probably got to wrap up. So let's go the back over there.

Audience: [inaudible] .

Kirsty Nathoo: Okay. So it's two things there. First thing is what happens if the founders are  putting in money themselves? The second thing is should they put in safes; not safe  notes because that makes me grouchy, because safes aren't debt, so you don't call them  notes. That's one of the things to bear in mind.

They're just safes.

The other  question was around the founders; there's different ways you can do that. If founders are  putting in money, they can just loan the company money, and so then, if they're  putting in $25,000 and then they raise a million dollars from the safe investors, they  could repay the founders or there are situations where the founders would put that money  in on a safe and so they potentially get some or they would in that  situation, get some series A preferred shares when the safes converts. So you can do  either way. All right. I think we finished on time, so that's good news. Thank  you very much for listening. I know this stuff's difficult.
