# A Conversation with Paul Graham - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: Well, thank you for coming this morning. We are trying something a little bit different this startup school year. We are not just having our weekly two lectures, but we are having some conversations with notable people, and I couldn't be happier to have one of the most notable startup people here. He'll get embarrassed when I say anything complimentary, so I'll try to avoid it. Paul Graham, my friend and the founder of Y Combinator, back in 2005. And we're just gonna talk, and hopefully it won't be boring. Paul.

杰夫·拉斯顿:嗯,谢谢你今天早上来。在这个创业学年,我们正在尝试一些不同的东西。我们不仅仅是每周举办两次讲座,我们还在和一些名人进行交谈,我很高兴在这里有一位最著名的创业人士。当我说任何恭维话时,他都会感到尴尬,所以我会尽量避免。保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)是我的朋友,也是Y Combinator的创始人,早在2005年。我们只是想谈谈,希望不会很无聊。保罗。

Paul Graham: Yes Jeff.

Paul Graham:是的，杰夫。

Geoff Ralston: So, you and I got to know each other strangely at a ... It was kind of a startup at the time. Yahoo, back in the late 90s.

Geoff Ralston:所以，你和我在一个……当时是个初创公司。雅虎，早在90年代末。

Paul Graham: 98.

Paul Graham:98。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: Do you guys know he wrote Yahoo Mail?

保罗。格雷厄姆:你们知道他写了雅虎邮件吗?

Geoff Ralston: Some of it, yeah.

Geoff Ralston:一些，是的。

Paul Graham: Y Combinator has the people who wrote Yahoo Mail and Gmail.

保罗·格雷厄姆:YCombinator有写雅虎邮件和Gmail的人。

Geoff Ralston: That is weird, right? Paul Bucheit, who actually has more of a claim on actually writing Gmail than I do have a claim on writing Yahoo Mail. I wrote some important parts of Yahoo Mail, but Paul was kind of by himself doing Gmail almost. And we were a little more intentional with Yahoo Mail, and had a team creating something called Rocket Mail. But it is a little weird that both of us ended up at YC years later. But Paul was at Yahoo, I was at Yahoo, because we created something called Rocket Mail, and we were purchased in 97. But Paul's company was bought in 98. And so, you had this weird idea for a product, for something that you thought people would want in the mid 90s, which had to do with sass before sass was a thing. How did you come up with this idea for Via Web, the company that Yahoo bought?

这很奇怪，对吧? PaulBucheit，实际上他比我对写雅虎邮件有更多的要求。我写了雅虎邮件的一些重要部分，但保罗几乎是一个人在写Gmail。我们对雅虎邮件有了更多的兴趣，有了一个团队来创建一个叫做火箭邮件的东西。但我们两个多年后都在YC结束了，这有点奇怪。但保罗在雅虎，我在雅虎，因为我们创建了一个称为火箭邮件，我们在97年购买。但保罗的公司是98年收购的。所以，你对一个产品有一个奇怪的想法，你认为人们在90年代中期会想要的东西，在Sass成为一个东西之前，这和Sass有关。对于雅虎收购的网络公司，你是怎么想出这个主意的?

Paul Graham: Okay. So, what we made was something that is now called a web app. At the time it was the first one, and that's why the company was called Via Web, because it worked via the web. And the way ... I remember it very vividly. We thought ... Back then everybody thought that writing software was identical with writing software that ran on the client, and were still, for those of you who remember the mid 90s, the client meant Windows, right? And like, we knew how to write software for Unix. We liked Unix. We did not know how to write software for Windows, but we knew enough to know that we did not want to learn. And so, we were really, really highly motivated to figure out how to write software without having to write software to run on Windows. And so, we thought to ourselves, well maybe ... You know, the way I first thought of it actually, was that you would have this ... It was an online store builder, right? And I thought that you could send it updates by email. I thought you could send it updates by email, right? And it would change your website. And then I remember thinking well, if you-

好的。所以，我们做的是一个现在叫做Web应用程序的东西。当时它是第一个，这就是为什么公司被称为通过网络，因为它的工作通过网络。我记得很清楚。我们认为。。。那时每个人都认为编写软件和在客户端运行的编写软件是一样的，对那些记得90年代中期的人来说，客户端指的是Windows，对吗? 就像，我们知道如何为UNIX编写软件。我们喜欢UNIX。我们不知道如何为Windows编写软件，但我们知道我们不想学习。因此，我们非常非常有动力地想出如何编写软件，而不必编写在Windows上运行的软件。所以，我们对自己说，也许。。。你知道，我最初的想法是，你会有这个。。。它是一个网上商店的建设者，对吗? 我想你可以通过邮件发送更新。我以为你可以通过邮件发送更新，对吧? 它会改变你的网站。后来我想起来了，如果你-

Geoff Ralston: Poster is for shopping carts or whatever.

Geoff Ralston:海报是购物车之类的。

Paul Graham: If you can use SMTP, why not HTTP to update your website? Whoa, you could ... The software could run on the server, and you could control it by clicking on links in the browser. Would that even work, right? But I remember. I was like sleeping on a mattress on the floor in Robert's spare bedroom, and I remember I sat up in bed when I thought of this. Like the letter L, right? It was actually like one of those scenes in a movie, I'm like oh my God, we could avoid having to write software on Windows at all. At that point we were never thinking about the benefits of web apps, which are great. As it turned out. We were just thinking we could actually do this without ever having to learn Windows.

保罗·格雷厄姆:如果你可以使用SMTP,为什么不使用HTTP来更新你的网站呢?哇你可以.。软件可以在服务器上运行,您可以通过单击浏览器中的链接来控制它。这样能行吗?但我记得。我就像睡在罗伯特空闲卧室地板上的床垫上,我记得我一想到这件事就坐在床上。就像字母L,对吧?这就像电影中的一个场景,我想,我的天哪,我们完全可以避免在Windows上编写软件。在那个时候,我们从来没有想过网络应用的好处,这是伟大的。事实证明。我们只是在想,我们不需要学习Windows就能做到这一点。


Geoff Ralston: So, it's all about avoiding Windows. It didn't matter that you could deploy then without having to ship software to ... None of that had come to you.

Geoff Ralston:所以，这一切都是为了回避 windows。你不需要把软件发布到。。。。。。。。你就可以进行部署，这并不重要。。。。。。。没有一件事情发生在你身上。。。。。。。

Paul Graham: No, no.

Paul Graham:不，不。

Geoff Ralston: It was just avoiding Windows.

Geoff Ralston:这只是在回避Windows。

Paul Graham: We could actually write this code-

PaulGraham:我们实际上可以写出这些代码-

Geoff Ralston: Thank you Bill Gates.

谢谢你，比尔·盖茨。

Paul Graham: ... And we'd never have to learn Windows. Because the Netscape people had already gone through the pain of making Netscape work on Windows, right? That was like a hole onto Windows, you know? And people could get through the hole and click on links in the browser and control the software. And so, we immediately ... We weren't even sure this would work, because it was so weird. But we immediately sat down and tried to write this really, really clunky website builder that worked by clicking on links. It was terrible, but it did actually work. It could make a website, we're like holy shit, this actually works.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我们就不用学Windows了。因为网景公司的人已经经历了让Netscape在Windows上工作的痛苦,对吧?那就像窗户上的一个洞,你知道吗?人们可以通过这个漏洞点击浏览器中的链接并控制软件。所以我们马上.。我们甚至不确定这会成功,因为这太奇怪了。但我们立即坐下来,试图写这个真的,非常笨重的网站建设者,通过点击链接工作。这很可怕,但它确实奏效了。它可以成为一个网站,我们就像上帝的屎,这实际上是可行的。


Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's weird that an innovative idea like that just sort of comes out of no ... I mean, it doesn't seem innovative now because all websites work that way. But the first one? That's going from zero to one. How do you ... It has to happen, right?

杰夫·拉斯顿:是的,奇怪的是,像这样的创新想法竟然是从没有.我的意思是,这似乎没有创新,因为所有的网站都是这样运作的。但第一个呢?从零到一。你怎么.。一定要发生对吧?



Paul Graham: It's very common for ideas. In retrospect, they seem obvious and you sort of ... historians who weren't there, sort of straighten out all the kinks in the development and it just seems like oh, they had this. It's like this idea. I always hate it when people represent startup ideas as light bulbs, you know? Because as well as being the most cliched metaphor imaginable, it's also false. You don't just have this idea, and then realize it, right? No, it's more like you have this sort of inkling that something ... You could do something that somebody else hasn't done before and it's probably a bad idea, but you're too lazy to learn Windows and so you wanna do it that way, right? And so, or like Zuch, starting Facebook. Just like let's see what happens, right? Way implausible that this would ever be a startup.

保罗格雷厄姆:这是非常常见的想法。回想起来,他们似乎很明显,你有点.那些不在场的历史学家们,在某种程度上理顺了发展过程中的所有纠结,看起来就像是-哦,他们有这样的想法。就像这个主意。我总是讨厌人们用灯泡来表达创业的想法,你知道吗?因为它不仅是最陈词滥调的隐喻,也是错误的。你不只是有这个想法,然后意识到它,对吗?不,更像是你有某种暗示.你可以做一些别人以前没有做过的事情,这可能是个坏主意,但是你太懒了,不想学习Windows,所以你想这样做,对吗?所以,或者像祖克一样,创建Facebook。就像让我们看看会发生什么,对吧?难以置信的是,这将永远是一家初创公司。


Geoff Ralston: Which is good for you all. Hopefully some of your ideas seem really implausible. Right?

Geoff Ralston:这对你们都有好处。希望你的一些想法真的不可信。对吧?

Paul Graham: I love it when ideas seem implausible in the right way. Over the years. I mean, I already had, just from being a hacker, a sort of a good nose for this sort of thing, but it has become refined over all these years of dealing with startups, and when people have ... I was talking to some people yesterday, and they were talking about two possible things they could do. And one of them seemed so ... It seemed like naughty. Not like it was sort of maltreating anyone, it was just sort of taking advantage of something that seemed like it shouldn't even be possible, right? Like making this software run on the server and just like, never ... Making software that seemed to the users to run on their computer, but actually it was just talking to them through the browser. That kinda naughtiness. And I said pick that one, because it seems so outrageous, it seems so hilarious.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我喜欢用正确的方式看上去不可信的想法。多年来。我是说,作为一个黑客,我已经对这类事情有了一种很好的嗅觉,但是这些年来,它在处理初创公司的过程中变得更精致了,而且当人们.我昨天和一些人谈过,他们讨论了两件他们可以做的事情。其中一个看起来如此.。好像很淘气。这并不是在虐待任何人,这只是在利用一些似乎根本不可能实现的东西,对吧?就像让这个软件在服务器上运行,就像,永远.在用户看来是在他们的电脑上运行的软件,但实际上它只是通过浏览器与他们交谈。有点淫荡。我说选那个,因为这看起来太离谱了,太搞笑了。

Geoff Ralston: It seems like there's all these ways we have talking about what's a good idea, and when you try to match up ideas with them, it's always sort of a complicated ... It's like, is this idea naughty? Or is it not quite intuitive, or not so obvious? And it's really always hard to take any particular idea and say is that the one with potential.

杰夫·拉斯顿:似乎我们有很多种方法来讨论什么是好主意,而当你试图将想法与它们相匹配时,它总是有点复杂。就像,这个想法很顽皮吗?或者它不是很直观,还是不那么明显?很难接受任何特定的想法,说那是一个有潜力的想法。

Paul Graham: Well, you can't tell, in fact. That's another thing. It's not just that the outcomes of startups are hard to predict. I think to some degree they're actually indeterminate. There's a huge amount of luck involved, you know? And so, I think even if Y Combinator were as good at picking startups as you could possibly get ... I mean, in fact you have 150 startups per batch of which maybe five will become giant, or something like that-

保罗·格雷厄姆:嗯,你不能说,事实上。那是另一回事。不仅仅是创业的结果难以预测。我认为在某种程度上它们是不确定的。有很大的运气,你知道吗?因此,我认为即使Y组合公司在挑选初创公司方面做得尽可能好.我的意思是,事实上你每批有150家创业公司,其中可能有5家会变得巨大,或者类似的-


Geoff Ralston: Hopefully five. That would be good.

希望是五个。那太好了。

Paul Graham: Yeah. Well, depends on your definition of giant, right? It's a parallel distribution. More like, for some definitions of giant, one every five batches.

Paul Graham:是的。取决于你对巨人的定义对吧? 这是一个平行分布。更像是，对于一些巨人的定义，每五批就有一个。

Geoff Ralston: We'll take five or any definition of giant. We'll be happy.

Geoff Ralston:我们将给巨人下五个或任何定义。我们会幸福的。

Paul Graham: So, what was I saying?

保罗·格雷厄姆:那么，我刚才说什么来着?

Geoff Ralston: You were talking the indeterminacy of ideas.

Geoff Ralston:你说的是思想的不确定性。

Paul Graham: Even if you were able to pick perfectly, that doesn't mean you could get the batches down to only five startups. You probably have to pick 20, I think. Even if you were perfect.

PaulGraham:即使你能选得很好，这并不意味着你能把批次减少到只有五家初创公司。我想你可能得挑20个。即使你是完美的。

Geoff Ralston: So, it's hard to know ... There's a strange mix of extraordinary hard work, an idea that has something to it but is not obvious.

Geoff Ralston:所以，很难知道。。。。。。。。有一种奇怪的，非常艰苦的工作，一种想法，有某种东西，但不是显而易见的。

Paul Graham: It's hard for founders to know.

保罗。格雷厄姆:创始人很难知道。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: You don't know yourselves. You don't know yourselves. I mean, you don't know comma yourselves. Not that you don't know yourselves, although that's also true. So, and that's why it's good to be a hacker because if you're some business person, and you think I'm going to work on business opportunities, right? Well, I don't know if this is a business opportunity so I'm not gonna work on it. Whereas someone who's a hacker, who's just doing things for the fun of it-

Paul Graham:你不了解自己。你不了解自己。我是说，你自己也不懂逗号。不是说你们不了解自己，虽然这也是真的。所以，这就是为什么成为一个黑客是好的，因为如果你是一些商业人士，你认为我会工作的商业机会，对吗? 好吧，我不知道这是不是一个商业机会，所以我不会去做。而一个黑客，只是为了好玩而做事的人-

Geoff Ralston: Or because they don't like Windows.

或者是因为他们不喜欢Windows。

Paul Graham: Right. Yeah. Laziness too.

Paul Graham:对。是啊。懒惰也是。

Geoff Ralston: Laziness is actually in some cases really helpful.

Geoff Ralston:在某些情况下，懒惰确实很有帮助。

Paul Graham: Some kinds of laziness.

Paul Graham:某种懒惰。

Geoff Ralston: Some kinds of laziness.

Geoff Ralston:某种懒惰。

Paul Graham: I'm a little scared about this meme escaping into the wild.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我有点害怕这个模因会逃到野外。

Geoff Ralston: Right.

好的。

Paul Graham: Can't you just see, can't you just see-

保罗?格雷厄姆:你就不能看一下，你就不能看一下-

Geoff Ralston: Well, it's true-

Geoff Ralston:嗯，这是真的-

Paul Graham: They said laziness is good. He said from the sofa, as he ate another donut, you know? It would be better if people thought laziness wasn't good, because the laziness, the kind that people do that's good, they would do anyway, even if they thought being lazy was bad.

Paul Graham:他们说懒惰是好事。他在沙发上说，当他吃另一个甜甜圈时，你知道吗? 如果人们认为懒惰是不好的，那会更好，因为懒惰，这种人们做的事情是好的，他们无论如何都会做的，即使他们认为懒惰是不好的。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Well, using laziness not in the normal sense of laziness, right? Because if you're lazy ... There's no such thing as a lazy founder that builds a big company. But a certain sort of ... It's sort of a reticence to do something for some reason. We're calling it laziness, but it's not really.

是的。用懒惰不是正常意义上的懒惰，对吧? 因为如果你懒惰的话。。。没有一个懒惰的创始人能建立一个大公司。但某种。。。出于某种原因，这是一种沉默。我们称它为懒惰，但并不是真的。

Paul Graham: Avoiding things that seem like gratuitous schleps.

保罗·格雷厄姆:避免那些看起来像是无缘无故的笨蛋的事情。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: It makes you ... If you have a natural hatred for gratuitous schleps, then that produces elegant solutions. You know?

保罗·格雷厄姆:如果你天生就讨厌无缘无故的傻瓜的话，那你就能找到更好的解决方案了。你知道吗?

Geoff Ralston: So, 1995 ish, I was trying every single idea I could possibly try to start some internet business, and I was doing it all by myself. Which was awful. And what I didn't know how to do was to find people to do it with, and I kinda ran into a bunch of people and I had no clue whether they would be good people to start companies with. And I was thinking about your experience, you said you were sleeping on Robert's floor. You started Via Web with two fascinating people, Robert Maxwell and Trevor Blackwell, who later-

Geoff Ralston:所以，1995年，ISH，我尝试了每一个我可能尝试的想法，开始一些互联网业务，我做的一切都是我自己。太可怕了。我不知道该怎么做，而是找人一起做，我遇到了一群人，我不知道他们是否会是一个好的人来开公司。我在想你的经历，你说你睡在罗伯特的地板上。你从网络开始和两个迷人的人，罗伯特·麦克斯韦和特雷弗·布莱克威尔，他们后来-

Paul Graham: Robert Morris.

罗伯特·莫里斯。

Geoff Ralston: Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell. Robert Maxwell. Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, and ... That was a weird mix of names. Anyway. How did you pick them as co-founders? How did that happen? And when did you decide they would be good co-founders?

罗伯特·莫里斯和特雷弗·布莱克威尔。罗伯特麦克斯韦。罗伯特·莫里斯和特雷弗·布莱克威尔，还有。。。那是个奇怪的名字组合。不管怎样。你是怎么选他们做联合创始人的? 怎么会这样? 你什么时候决定让他们成为好的联合创始人?

Paul Graham: Were they good co-founders? All right.

保罗·格雷厄姆:他们是好的联合创始人吗? 那好吧。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: Right? They were extremely-

Paul Graham:对吗? 他们非常-

Geoff Ralston: It worked.

它起作用了。

Paul Graham: They were extremely truculent co-founders who were very good at programming. But I remember Robert was not into the whole startup thing the entire way. Whenever he was on the board, and whenever you get an acquisition offer, the board has to at least consider it, right? And so, we would get these crap lowball acquisition offers. We'll give you like two million dollars in our stock, right?

保罗。格雷厄姆:他们是非常好斗的联合创始人，擅长编程。但我记得罗伯特并没有完全投入到创业的过程中。每当他在董事会时，每当你收到收购要约时，董事会至少要考虑一下，对吧? 所以，我们会得到这些垃圾低球收购的机会。我们会给你两百万美元的存货，对吧?

Geoff Ralston: And Robert was like yes.

Geoff Ralston:罗伯特说的是肯定的。

Paul Graham: No, no. Robert would say ... We would vote on it, and Robert would always say, "Well, you know, I have to be honest here. This would at least mean we could stop working on this thing." And so, yes I would take this deal, right? I made a deal with Robert that if he ever made a million dollars out of Via Web, he would get an earring. Robert is not the kinda guy who would enjoy having an earring, let me tell you. And so, as soon as the deal closed, me and Trevor frog marched him to the place in Harvard Square where people get their things pierced-

Paul Graham:不，不。罗伯特会说。。。我们会投票表决，罗伯特总是说，“好吧，你知道，我必须老实说。这至少意味着我们可以停止这件事。” 所以，是的，我愿意接受这个交易，对吗? 我和罗伯特做了一个交易，如果他通过网络赚了一百万美元，他会得到一个耳环。我告诉你，罗伯特不是那种喜欢戴耳环的人。所以，交易一结束，我和特雷弗·青蛙就把他带到了哈佛广场，在那里人们的东西被刺穿了-

Geoff Ralston: I've never heard this before.

Geoff Ralston:我以前从没听过这个。

Paul Graham: And we got him an earring. There's photographs on the internet of Robert Morris with an earring.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我们给他买了个耳环。网上有罗伯特·莫里斯戴耳环的照片。

Geoff Ralston: I bet he didn't keep it.

Geoff Ralston:我打赌他没留着。

Paul Graham: Not for long. We should've specified that. I never thought to specify.

保罗·格雷厄姆:不会太久的。我们应该说清楚的。我从没想过要具体说明。

Geoff Ralston: You never thought you'd actually get the million dollars.

Geoff Ralston:你从来没想过你会得到一百万美元。

Paul Graham: No, no. I really actually did. But I thought he would wear it for a bit longer. When his fiance saw it, she fell on the floor.

Paul Graham:不，不。真的。但我想他会穿久一点。当他的未婚夫看到时，她倒在了地板上。

Geoff Ralston: Why did you choose truculent founders? Co-founders?

Geoff Ralston:你为什么要选择好斗的创始人? 联合创始人?

Paul Graham: So, I chose Robert because he was my co-conspirator in everything. And I don't mean I was always the lead and he was just the co-conspirator. When he did things, I would be his co-conspirator too. Like the internet worm of 1988.

保罗·格雷厄姆:所以，我选择罗伯特，是因为他是我在一切事情上的同谋。我不是说我一直是主角而他只是同谋。当他做事的时候，我也会是他的同谋。就像1988年的网虫一样。

Geoff Ralston: Do you guys know, Robert Morris is pretty famous all on his own?

Geoff Ralston:你们知道吗，罗伯特·莫里斯一个人是很有名的。

Paul Graham: Yeah. He invented buffer overflow. And I remember when he told me about it, and I said, "Wow, what a cool idea. You should totally do that."

Paul Graham:是的。他发明了缓冲区溢出。我还记得他告诉我这件事的时候，我说:“哇，真是个好主意。你真该这么做。”

Geoff Ralston: He was the first famous hacker who really got in trouble, I think.

Geoff Ralston:我想，他是第一个真正陷入困境的著名黑客。

Paul Graham: Yeah.

Paul Graham:是的。

Geoff Ralston: Really in trouble.

真的有麻烦了。

Paul Graham: He was the way ... It's true. He was the first person to be prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, which ...

保罗。格雷厄姆:他就是这样。。。这是真的。他是第一个根据1986年“计算机欺诈和滥用法”被起诉的人。。。

Geoff Ralston: So, if you're looking for a co-founder, look at people who've been prosecuted because it works.

Geoff Ralston:所以，如果你想找一个联合创始人，那就看看那些因为工作成功而被起诉的人吧。

Paul Graham: Yeah. He was actually a convicted felon. The funny thing was-

Paul Graham:是的。他实际上是一个被定罪的重罪犯。有趣的是-

Geoff Ralston: Okay, this is another meme we don't necessarily want to escape out there, that convicted felons are what you wanna look for as co-founders.

Geoff Ralston:好吧，这是另一个我们不一定想要逃避的模式，被判有罪的罪犯是你想要寻找的共同创始人。

Paul Graham: If they're convicted for that-

保罗·格雷厄姆:如果他们因此被定罪-

Geoff Ralston: Maybe, yeah.

也许吧，是的。

Paul Graham: It was funny, because the FBI, law enforcement kinda does things by the book, right? Imagination is a big thing in Sherlock Holmes stories, but not in actually everyday law enforcement. And so, they have these ... The FBI agent told me, they have these motive that they look for. Sex, drugs, money, revenge, right? And so, Robert did it out of curiosity, and that just ... It was just not on the list. Right? They really had a hard time figuring out what the hell was going on, and I think even within the government there were lots of people who never understood what was going on.

保罗。格雷厄姆:这很有趣，因为联邦调查局，执法部门都是按规矩办事的，对吧? 想像在福尔摩斯的故事中是一件大事，但实际上并不是在日常执法中。所以，他们有这些。。。联邦调查局的探员告诉我的，他们找到了这些动机。性，毒品，金钱，报复，对吧? 所以，罗伯特是出于好奇，那只是。。。它不在名单上。对吧? 他们真的很难搞清楚究竟发生了什么事，我想即使在政府内部，也有很多人从来不知道究竟发生了什么事。

Geoff Ralston: So, back to Robert and Trevor, who-

Geoff Ralston:那么，回到罗伯特和特雷弗，谁-

Paul Graham: Oh, so why did I pick Robert and Trevor?

保罗·格雷厄姆:哦，那我为什么要选罗伯特和特雷弗呢?

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: So, Robert I picked because I would do everything with him, right? We had all these schemes. And-

保罗·格雷厄姆:那么，罗伯特是我选的，因为我愿意和他做任何事，对吗? 我们有所有这些计划。以及-

Geoff Ralston: And so you knew you could work with him.

Geoff Ralston:所以你知道你可以和他合作。

Paul Graham: I knew I could work with him and I knew he was really good. He was a really good programmer. He could program as fast as he could type. Of course, this was in C, which is a lot of very verbose language. But he could program as fast as he could type. He was amazing. If he didn't like what the operating system would do, he would edit the source, and recompile it, and then it would do what he wanted.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我知道我可以和他合作，我也知道他真的很棒。他是个很好的程序员。他可以像打字一样快速地编程。当然，这是在C语言，这是很多非常详细的语言。但他可以像打字一样快速编程。他太棒了。如果他不喜欢操作系统会做什么，他会编辑源代码，重新编译它，然后它会做他想做的。

Geoff Ralston: So, truculence aside, he was exceptional.

Geoff Ralston:所以，抛开暴力不谈，他是个与众不同的人。

Paul Graham: Like when he showed up at Harvard, undergrads were only allowed to have accounts on the official undergrad computing system off in the science center, and there were all these real computers in the CS department in the [Aiken] lab, and so they wouldn't give him an account there. And so, he just walked up to a machine, switched it to single user with him as the super user, gave himself an account, and then switched it back. Right?

保罗•格雷厄姆:就像他出现在哈佛大学(Harvard)时一样，只有在科学中心才允许大学生拥有官方本科计算机系统的账户，而计算机系的计算机都在[艾肯]实验室里，所以他们不会给他在那里的账户。于是，他走到一台机器前，把它换成了一个超级用户，给了自己一个帐号，然后又转回来了。对吧?

Geoff Ralston: He was curious.

他很好奇。

Paul Graham: Yeah. Well, he also wanted accounts on the right machines. He got kicked ... This whole thing will be about Robert. Robert's such an interesting character. I shouldn't talk about this-

Paul Graham:是的。他还想要正确机器上的账户。他被踢了。。。整件事都是关于罗伯特的。罗伯特是个很有趣的人物。我不该谈这个-

Geoff Ralston: He may be more interesting than anything else we can talk about.

Geoff Ralston:他可能比我们能谈论的任何事情都有趣。

Paul Graham: He got kicked out of Harvard as an undergrad for reconnecting Harvard to the internet. Harvard had been one of the early internet nodes.

保罗。格雷厄姆:他因重新连接哈佛大学与互联网而被哈佛大学开除。哈佛大学是最早的互联网节点之一。

Geoff Ralston: Does that sound funny to get in trouble for disconnecting a school from the internet?

Geoff Ralston:从互联网上切断一所学校的网路，惹上麻烦，这听起来有趣吗?

Paul Graham: No, connecting it, connecting it.

Paul Graham:不，连接它，连接它。

Geoff Ralston: I mean, for connecting a school to the internet?

Geoff Ralston:我的意思是，把一所学校连到互联网上?

Paul Graham: He got in trouble ... Where were we?

保罗。格雷厄姆:他有麻烦了。。。我们说到哪儿了?

Geoff Ralston: We're still trying to figure out why the heck you chose Robert and Trevor.

Geoff Ralston:我们还在想你为什么选择罗伯特和特雷弗。

Paul Graham: Oh, I should tell you though about how he reconnected-

保罗·格雷厄姆:哦，我应该告诉你，他是如何重新联系的-

Geoff Ralston: Oh, tell us about the disconnected-

Geoff Ralston:哦，跟我们说说那个被切断的-

Paul Graham: I'll make it really fast.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我会让它变得非常快。

Geoff Ralston: No, no. It's okay. We have all day.

不，不。没事的。我们有一整天的时间。

Paul Graham: We don't, do we?

Paul Graham:我们没有，是吗?

Geoff Ralston: No, we don't.

不，我们没有。

Paul Graham: Okay. How long do we have?

好的。我们还有多长时间?

Geoff Ralston: We have enough time.

我们有足够的时间。

Paul Graham: We have the same watch.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我们有一只手表。

Geoff Ralston: More or less.

多多少少。

Paul Graham: Robert. So, Harvard was one of the very early internet nodes, and by the time Robert arrived, as an undergrad, the connection had died from Bit decay. And no one noticed, right? That's how unimportant the internet was back then, or rather ARPANET, as it was then called.

罗伯特。因此，哈佛大学是一个很早的互联网节点，当罗伯特作为一个本科毕业生来到这里时，这种联系已经死于比特衰退。没人注意到，对吧? 这就是当时互联网是多么的不重要，或者更确切地说，是arpanet，因为它当时被称为。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it was barely an internet, right?

Geoff Ralston:是的，它几乎不是一个互联网，对吗?

Paul Graham: And so, RTM spent one whole semester working on getting Harvard reconnected to the internet-

保罗·格雷厄姆:所以，RTM花了整整一个学期的时间致力于让哈佛大学重新连接到互联网上-

Geoff Ralston: RTM is Robert's-

罗尔斯顿:RTM是罗伯特的-

Paul Graham: Yes, yes. Robert. He didn't do any work for any of his classes, and he got such bad grades he got kicked out for a year. So, we actually used that later as a recruiting technique because we knew that ... Because there might be other people who got kicked out for spending all their time on some project. And so, we actually went around Harvard and posted up this poster saying did you get kicked out for working on some project of your own? We'd like to hire you.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的，是的。罗伯特。他没有为任何一个班做任何工作，而且他得了如此糟糕的成绩，被开除了一年。因此，我们后来实际上将其作为一种招聘技巧，因为我们知道。。。因为可能还有其他人因为花全部时间在某个项目上而被开除。所以，我们真的去了哈佛，贴了一张海报，上面写着，你是不是因为自己的项目而被开除了? 我们想雇用你。

Geoff Ralston: I think there's probably something-

Geoff Ralston:我想可能有什么-

Paul Graham: We got a really great programmer that way.

保罗。格雷厄姆:我们有一个很棒的程序员。

Geoff Ralston: There's probably something-

Geoff Ralston:可能有什么-

Paul Graham: He made tons of money off of options because we got acquired during the year, right? And he enjoyed life out of school so much, I don't think he went back until he was 25. All right, so why Trevor? Why Trevor? Well-

保罗。格雷厄姆:他从期权中赚了很多钱，因为我们在一年中就被收购了，对吗? 他很享受放学后的生活，我想他直到25岁才回去。那为什么是特雷弗? 为什么是特雷弗? 很好-

Geoff Ralston: So, you picked Rob. Robert was the guy you did everything with, and he was great.

那么，你选了罗伯。罗伯特是和你一起做任何事的人，他很棒。

Paul Graham: Okay, so after we'd been doing-

保罗·格雷厄姆:好吧，那么在我们做了-

Geoff Ralston: Oh by the way, when you picked Robert, did you know he was gonna be a pain in the ass in so many ways, as you ... Or was that a surprise to you?

Geoff Ralston:哦，顺便问一下，你选罗伯特的时候，你知道他会在很多方面让你感到痛苦吗?

Paul Graham: Well, I knew he was a pain in the ass. I didn't know the company was gonna be so hard, and that would bring so much pain in the ass-

保罗·格雷厄姆:嗯，我知道他是个讨厌鬼。我不知道公司会变得这么难，那会给你的屁股带来太多的痛苦-

Geoff Ralston: So, you didn't realize how hard startups were?

Geoff Ralston:那么，你没意识到创业有多困难?

Paul Graham: Let me tell you, the way we got Trevor was very indicative.

Paul Graham:让我告诉你，我们得到特雷弗的方式是非常有象征意义的。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: So, a month in, we'd been working on this company for a month, and Robert rebels. And he says, "We've been working on this company for a whole month, and it's still not done." I'm like, what have we gotten into, right? And I thought maybe we need more programmers. And so, I said, "All right, Robert. Who's the smartest person you know in grad school?" And he said, "Trevor." Right? And I said, "Trevor?" Right? Because Trevor's one of those people who's a lot smarter than he seems. And so, but Trevor is actually super smart, and so we went and recruited Trevor, and he said, "Oh, okay." That's a really good Trevor imitation, actually.

保罗。格雷厄姆:那么，一个月过去了，我们已经在这家公司工作了一个月，罗伯特。他说:“我们在这家公司工作了整整一个月，但还没有完成。” 我是说，我们之间发生了什么，对吧? 我想也许我们需要更多的程序员。所以，我说，“好吧，罗伯特，谁是你在研究生院认识的最聪明的人?” 他说:“特雷弗。” 对吧? 我说，“特雷弗?” 对吧? 因为特雷弗是那种比他看上去聪明得多的人。所以，但特雷弗实际上是超级聪明，所以我们去招募特雷弗，他说，“哦，好的。” 这是一个很好的特雷弗模仿，实际上。

Geoff Ralston: That almost sounded Canadian.

Geoff Ralston:这听起来几乎像是加拿大人的声音。

Paul Graham: Trevor has two modes. Oh, okay, and oh, I'm sorry. That's just what he does when he does something that breaks everything. Which was very common, very common. And so, we got Trevor. I recruited Trevor to work on the thing. He does nothing for two weeks, at least as far as I can tell. He just disappears. And then two weeks later he says, "Come into my office." And he's rewritten all our Goddamn software in small talk, you know? Is that typical?

Paul Graham:特雷弗有两种模式。哦，好吧，哦，对不起。当他做一些破坏一切的事情时，他就是这么做的。很常见，很常见。所以，我们有特雷弗。我招募特雷弗来处理这件事。至少据我所知，他两个星期什么也没做。他就这么消失了。两周后，他说:“到我办公室来。” 他用闲聊的方式改写了我们所有的软件，你知道吗? 这是典型的吗?

Geoff Ralston: Yes.

Geoff Ralston:是的。

Paul Graham: So, I said, "All right, Trevor. We're not using that. But do this instead." Right? And so, Trevor was like this super productive hacking monster.

保罗·格雷厄姆:所以，我说，“好吧，特雷弗，我们不是在用这个，而是用这个。” 对吧? 所以，特雷弗就像一个超级高效的黑客怪物。

Geoff Ralston: But you didn't know that in advance. You just trusted Robert, when Robert told you he was really smart.

Geoff Ralston:但你事先不知道。你刚刚信任罗伯特，罗伯特告诉你他真的很聪明。

Paul Graham: Well, if Robert said he was the smartest, he's definitely the smartest.

保罗·格雷厄姆:嗯，如果罗伯特说他是最聪明的，那他绝对是最聪明的。

Geoff Ralston: But there's kind of a deep lesson in that, in how you pick ... Whether it's employees or co-founders, it's you find someone you trust, and then find someone they trust.

Geoff Ralston:但这其中有一个深刻的教训，那就是你如何选择。。。不管是员工还是联合创始人，你都要找到你信任的人，然后再找到他们信任的人。

Paul Graham: Yeah, although, here's an interesting point. That works better for some qualities than others. Intelligent people can judge other intelligent people, but trustworthy people cannot judge other trustworthy people. In fact, trustworthy people are often fooled by untrustworthy people. So, like Kate [Cortos] , our architect who did this, is like super trustworthy, but she's always fooled by these sneaky schemers who take advantage of her.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的，不过，这里有一个有趣的问题。这对某些品质比其他品质更有效。聪明的人可以判断其他聪明的人，而值得信任的人不能判断其他值得信任的人。事实上，值得信任的人经常被不值得信任的人愚弄。所以，就像Kate[Cortos]，我们的建筑师做了这件事，就像超级值得信任，但她总是被那些利用她的狡猾的阴谋家愚弄。

Geoff Ralston: So, I guess that means you take recommendations from people, but then you have to add your own-

Geoff Ralston:所以，我想这意味着你接受别人的建议，但是你必须加上你自己的-

Paul Graham: No, no, no. You could totally trust ... Like if Robert says someone's smart, and I disagree, I think I must be wrong, right?

Paul Graham:不，不，不。你完全可以相信。。。就像罗伯特说某人聪明，而我不同意，我想我一定错了，对吧?

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, but you need to-

Geoff Ralston:是的，但是你需要-

Paul Graham: It just works for some qualities better than others, this whole recommendation thing.

保罗·格雷厄姆:这只是对某些品质更有效，比其他品质更好，整个推荐的事情。

Geoff Ralston: But if you want them to be trustworthy when they join you as a co-founder so you have to add that judgment on top-

Geoff Ralston:但是如果你想让他们在加入你成为联合创始人时变得值得信任，那么你就必须在上面加上这个判断-

Paul Graham: For trustworthiness, yes. This whole thing of networking doesn't work. It doesn't. You have to have someone who can judge whether people are trustworthy, which I am not even good at. I am not good at. The person who does that for Y Combinator is Jessica, the social radar. The secret power behind everything.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的，值得信赖。整个社交网络都不起作用。不是。你必须有一个能判断人是否值得信任的人，而我甚至不擅长这个。我不擅长。为Y Combinator做这件事的人是Jessica，社交雷达。一切背后的秘密力量。

Geoff Ralston: So, you did hire people at Via Web too.

Geoff Ralston:那么，你也确实在网络公司雇了人。

Paul Graham: Yes.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的。

Geoff Ralston: What did you learn about hiring in your first startup? So, you learned that if they were getting lousy grades, because they were working on a project, that seemed good. Which is kinda counterintuitive. A lot of things we seem to do at YC end up being counterintuitive.

Geoff Ralston:你在第一个创业公司里学到了什么? 所以，你学到了，如果他们的成绩很差，因为他们在做一个项目，这看起来很好。这有点违背直觉。我们在YC做的很多事情都是违反直觉的。

Paul Graham: Startups in general are very, very counterintuitive. And so, that's actually YC exists. If it was obvious what to do in starting a startup, we wouldn't ... YC couldn't really add much by teaching people how to do it, right? And so, I often say, I often in fact, practically every day if I do office hours, I'm reminded of this. That what Y Combinator does is tell founders things that they ignore, right? So, we tell people don't hire too fast, and then they go off and hire too fast, and then they come back later and say, "Oh, I wish we'd listened." But all the things we tell people, we tell people the counterintuitive stuff, not the obvious stuff. And then what counterintuitive means is it sounds wrong. And so, they go with their gut, and do the wrong thing instead, and then hopefully catch the mistake in time.

PaulGraham:一般来说，初创公司是非常，非常违反直觉的。这就是YC的存在。如果创业的过程很明显，我们就不会。。。YC不会通过教人们如何去做来增加很多东西，对吧? 所以，我经常说，事实上，我几乎每天上班的时候，我都会想到这一点。YCombinator所做的就是告诉创始人他们忽略的事情，对吧? 所以，我们告诉人们不要雇佣得太快，然后他们就离开了，而且雇佣的太快，然后他们回来说，“哦，我希望我们当初能听进去。” 但是所有我们告诉别人的事情，我们告诉别人的是违反直觉的事情，而不是显而易见的事情。然后，违反直觉的意思是，这听起来是错误的。所以，他们跟着自己的直觉走，然后做错了事情，然后希望能及时抓住这个错误。

Geoff Ralston: Why is it that startups are so counterintuitive?

Geoff Ralston:为什么初创公司如此违背直觉?

Paul Graham: You know, that would be very much writing an essay about. That would be worth writing an essay about. Why startups are so counterintuitive. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I could come up with some theories, but I have a feeling the answer is so interestingly complicated, I would be unlikely to come up with a-

保罗·格雷厄姆:你知道，写一篇关于。那就值得写一篇关于。为什么初创公司如此违背直觉。我不知道。我不知道。我不知道。我可以想出一些理论，但我觉得答案很复杂，我不太可能想出一个-

Geoff Ralston: I mean, we were just talking about one of the things that you did write an essay about, which is somewhat counterintuitive. When you start a startup, and you're like okay, now I'm gonna grow, and you write a whole bunch of stuff, you're writing software that helps you grow, and you wrote a whole essay that says don't do that. Do things that don't scale.

Geoff Ralston:我的意思是，我们只是在讨论你写的一篇文章中的一件事，这有点违背直觉。当你创业的时候，你会觉得很好，现在我要成长了，你写了一大堆东西，你在写帮助你成长的软件，你写了一整篇文章说不要那么做。做一些不容易扩展的事情。

Paul Graham: In the beginning, yeah. Do things that don't scale. Because growth is-

保罗·格雷厄姆:一开始，是的。做一些不容易扩展的事情。因为成长是-

Geoff Ralston: Well, maybe you can start by saying what it means to do things that don't scale, because I don't know if you guys have read this essay-

Geoff Ralston:也许你可以先说说做不到比例的事情意味着什么，因为我不知道你们是否读过这篇文章-

Paul Graham: Really? You have not all read-

真的吗? 你还没读过-

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, I'm sure you've all read all of Paul's essay, but this is actually very important, because most of you all have early startups, and when you do an early startup, its become our mantra at YC, and I've seen it again, and again. You should not try to do too much in the beginning. You should do things that don't scale.

Geoff Ralston:是的，我相信你们都读过保罗的所有文章，但这实际上是非常重要的，因为你们大多数人都有早期创业的经历，而当你们做一个早期创业的时候，它就成了我们在YC的口号，我已经看了一遍又一遍。一开始你不应该做太多。你应该做一些不可以扩展的事情。

Paul Graham: What doing things that don't scale means specifically is doing things in a sort of handmade artisanal painstaking way. That you feel like yeah, it would be great if you could do things that way forever, but in the back of your mind, you think to yourself, well there's no way we can keep doing this and become giant, right? And what do things that don't scale means is do those things early on anyway, because if you don't do them, you'll never be big so you've got nothing to lose. And also, you learn a lot from it. You learn a lot. And so, I discovered a lot of this things that we teach startups at Y Combinator, or you teach startups at Y Combinator, I'm retired. I don't know if you know that, but a lot of things you guys teach startups is are things that I hit myself, and didn't realize that they were actually common startup lessons. So, one of them is doing things very manually for your early customers. It's so important to get early customers that if you have to do a ton of manual stuff, that's okay. You'll learn a lot from it.

PaulGraham:什么是无法扩展的事情，具体来说，就是用手工制作的，手工的，辛苦的方式来做事情。你觉得是的，如果你能永远这样做会很棒，但是在你的脑海里，你会想，好吧，我们不可能继续这样做，成为巨人，对吗? 如果你不去做，你就永远不会变大，所以你不会失去任何东西。而且，你从中学到了很多。你学到了很多。所以，我发现了很多这样的事情，我们在Y Combinator教初创公司，或者你在Y Combinator教初创公司，我已经退休了。我不知道你是否知道，但是你们教初创公司的很多东西都是我自己打到自己的教训，并且没有意识到它们实际上是共同的创业课程。因此，他们中的一个正在为您的早期客户做非常手工的事情。这是非常重要的，让早期的客户，如果你必须做大量的手工工作，这是可以的。你会从中学到很多。

Geoff Ralston: Did you guys do manual stuff at-

Geoff Ralston:你们在-

Paul Graham: Yes, oh yes. Totally. And we thought oh, we're doing it wrong. This is so lame. And in fact it was exactly the right thing. We made an online store builder. You could build a store on the internet and sell stuff, and we would go to would be customers and say, "Would you like to use our easy online store builder?" And they would say, "No." And we would say, "But you want an online store, right?" And they would say, "Yeah." And then they would say, "Well, what if we use ..." We would say, "What if we used our software for you to make an online store, and then you could have it. Would that be good?" And they'd say, "All right." And so, we're like we can't get anyone to use our software, but at least they're willing to let us use it for them. And it seemed so lame. I learned so much shit about direct marketing, as it turns out it's called. We were members of the DMA, the Direct Marketing Association. You know, in every business-

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的，哦，是的。完全正确。我们想，哦，我们做错了。太逊了。事实上这是正确的选择。我们做了一个网上商店建筑商。你可以在互联网上建立一个商店，销售商品，我们会去客户，并说，“你愿意使用我们的简易网上商店建设者?” 他们会说，“不。” 我们会说，“但你想要网上商店，对吗?” 他们会说，“是的。” 然后他们会说，“好吧，如果我们用。。。”我们会说，“如果我们用我们的软件为你做一个网上商店，然后你就可以拥有它。这样好吗?” 他们会说，“好吧。” 所以，我们好像不能让任何人使用我们的软件，但至少他们愿意让我们使用它为他们。看起来很逊。我学到了很多关于直销的东西，结果它被称为。我们是DMA的成员，直接营销协会。你知道，在每一件事上-

Geoff Ralston: Card carrying member of the DMA.

卡上有DMA的成员。

Paul Graham: We were, we were. In every business, they have a name for the business that's not the name outsiders call it. Like fast food. No, no, no, they don't call it that, they call it fast casual within the industry, right? And in the catalog business, they used to call the direct marketing industry. Right? So, that's what DMA meant back in those days, the catalog business. We signed up for every catalog. You know those catalogs you get in the mail? We would just write an ask for more. We had this bookshelf full of every catalog, ever.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我们是，我们是。在每一个企业中，他们都有一个不是外人所称的企业名称。比如快餐。不，不，不，他们不这么叫，他们叫这个行业里的快速休闲，对吧? 在目录业务中，他们通常把直接营销行业称为直接营销行业(direct marketing industry)。对吧? 所以，在那个年代，目录业务就是DMA的意思。我们签了所有的目录。你知道你收到的那些目录吗? 我们只会写一个要求更多。我们有一个书架，里面装满了所有的目录。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it seems like almost like if you were building a new search engine, what you oughta do is have your box out there and then just take all the searches manually, and get results and throw them out there and see what happens. I'm trying to think what we did for mail that was manual in the beginning. We had sort of a manual ad server. We didn't really have ad serving technology. We'd just throw ads. I wrote it, so it wasn't really good, and we would just throw them in there. There's a deep lesson there, for people though. What happens if you think you know the solution, and you build lots of stuff for it, you're going to be wrong, because you just don't know it.

杰夫·拉斯顿:是的,看起来就像如果你在构建一个新的搜索引擎,你应该做的就是把你的盒子放在那里,然后手动完成所有的搜索,然后得到结果,然后把它们扔出去,看看会发生什么。我试着想一想,我们在邮件上做了些什么,这在一开始就是手动的。我们有一台手动广告服务器。我们没有真正的广告服务技术。我们只会投放广告。我写的,所以不是很好,我们就把它们扔进去。不过,对人们来说,这是一个深刻的教训。如果你认为你知道解决方案,你为它建立了很多东西,那你就错了,因为你不知道。


Paul Graham: Having to use our software myself made it much better, because I would be using our software to make someone's website, right? And I was also the guy who wrote the site builder. And so, I would be using it and think to myself ugh, this is inconvenient. I'd go, in the middle of building their site, I would change the software and, I mean, ship. As in MV. And that's the great thing about server based software. Ship is the Unix MV command. So, well no, CP. I would wanna keep a copy-

保罗·格雷厄姆:必须自己使用我们的软件才能让它变得更好,因为我会用我们的软件来创建别人的网站,对吗?我也是写网站建设者的人。所以,我会用它自己想,呃,这很不方便。我会去,在建设他们的网站,我会改变软件,我的意思是,船。就像MV一样。这就是基于服务器的软件的伟大之处。Ship是UnixMV命令。所以,不,CP。我想留一份-

Geoff Ralston: You would copy source-

Geoff Ralston:你会复制消息来源-

Paul Graham: ... So I could keep editing. But I would change the software in the middle of using it, and then go back to working on their website, and boy did that make that ... That made the software much better that I had to use it.

Paul Graham:。。。所以我可以继续编辑。但我会在使用的过程中改变软件，然后回到他们的网站上工作，而男孩做到了这一点。。。这使得软件变得更好，我必须使用它。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. So, picking co-founders, you wanna pick the best people who you can somehow believe are trustworthy. That's probably helpful for a lot of people. I think a lot of people taking the class are sole founders now.

是的。所以，选择联合创始人，你会选择你认为值得信赖的最好的人。这可能对很多人都有帮助。我认为许多人参加了这个课程，现在是唯一的创始人。

Paul Graham: Yeah.

Paul Graham:是的。

Geoff Ralston: Why is it that sole founders, that being a sole founder is so difficult?

Geoff Ralston:为什么是那个唯一的创始人，成为一个唯一的创始人是如此的困难?

Paul Graham: Wow. There's so many different reasons. I think the hardest part is morale. There's no one ... If you have multiple people, they keep one another going when things are going badly, and there's no one to cheer you up.

哇。有很多不同的原因。我认为最难的部分是士气。没有人。。。如果你有很多人，他们在事情不顺利的时候互相支持，没有人能让你开心。

Geoff Ralston: That's what was hard for me. I remember 95, I'd be like I know this internet thing's gonna be real, but damn.

Geoff Ralston:这对我来说很难。我记得95年，我就好像我知道这件事会是真的，但是该死的。

Paul Graham: Oh, so you were a sole founder?

保罗·格雷厄姆:哦，那么你是唯一的创始人了?

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Yeah.

是的。是啊。

Paul Graham: That's why his hair is grayer than mine.

保罗。格雷厄姆:这就是为什么他的头发比我的要白。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, being a sole founder's hard. It's hard because there's a million reasons why what you're doing isn't going to work, and mostly you're right. So, it's easy to convince yourself to ... Paul used to say this, and I always remember it. You used to say look, you have two choices as a founder. Do you remember what you would say after that?

Geoff Ralston:是的，成为唯一的创始人很难。这很难，因为你所做的事有无数的理由不起作用，而且大多数情况下你是对的。所以，你很容易说服自己。。。保罗过去常这么说，我一直记得。你过去常说，作为创始人，你有两个选择。你还记得之后你会说什么吗?

Paul Graham: Well, there's so many different cases.

保罗·格雷厄姆:嗯，有很多不同的案例。

Geoff Ralston: Versions of this. Well, he would say you could either quit, or get rich.

Geoff Ralston:这个版本。他会说你要么辞职要么发财。

Paul Graham: Yeah. Die or get rich.

Paul Graham:是的。要么死要么致富。

Geoff Ralston: Versions of this. Well, he would say you could either quit, or get rich.

Geoff Ralston:这个版本。他会说你要么辞职要么发财。

Geoff Ralston: Like the company, either version-

Geoff Ralston:就像公司一样，不管是哪个版本-

Paul Graham: That's what happens with startups, mostly. The company either dies, or [crosstalk] succeeds, you get rich.

保罗•格雷厄姆:这是初创企业的主要特点。公司要么倒闭，要么(串扰)成功，你就会发财。

Geoff Ralston: And you know, getting rich can mean you have a nice little business where you're the boss and you have 20 or 50 employees, or could mean that you're Airbnb, right? They're both good outcomes. Not as good for your investors, necessarily, but for you, they're really good. And doing things that don't scale, that's ... And internalizing what that really means. I was thinking about one of the ... This is sort of a things that don't scale that we talk about at YC all the time. We say you're supposed to, for success, you talk to users and write code. You talk, and if you think about it, talking to users, especially as sort of the founder, doesn't really scale very well. But that's what it forces you to do, if you have to do everything that doesn't scale. Forces you to learn.

杰夫·拉斯顿:你知道,致富意味着你有一家不错的小公司,在那里你是老板,你有20或50名员工,或者可能意味着你是Airbnb,对吧?它们都是很好的结果。不一定对你的投资者有好处,但对你来说,他们真的很好。做一些没有规模的事情,那是.并内化这意味着什么。我在想一个.这是一种没有规模的东西,我们一直在YC讨论。我们说,为了成功,你应该和用户交谈并编写代码。你说,如果你想一想,与用户交谈,特别是作为创始人,并不是很好的规模。但是,如果你必须做任何没有规模的事情,那就是它强迫你去做的事情。强迫你学习。


Paul Graham: Right. In the beginning, you only have 10 customers, you wanna grow 20%. You wanna grow 10% next week. 10% a week's an ambitious goal. We only gotta get one more customer. You can go out and do that very manually, right? And then next week you have 11 customers, you have to get 1.1 customers, right? Which is basically one, right? U just keep going out there and doing things manually, and as long as your growth rate is good, it doesn't matter how small the number is because a constant growth rate means exponential growth, and that means the base number will soon take care of itself.

保罗·格雷厄姆:对。一开始,你只有10个客户,你想要增长20%。你想下周长10%。每周10%是一个雄心勃勃的目标。我们只需要再找一个顾客。你可以出去手动完成,对吧?然后下周你有11个客户,你必须得到1.1个客户,对吗?基本上是一个,对吧?只要你继续走出去,手工操作,只要你的增长率是好的,不管这个数字有多小,因为一个恒定的增长率意味着指数的增长,这意味着基数很快就会自己处理好。

Geoff Ralston: I was kinda thinking about what makes companies good, and what makes companies fail. And I was thinking about maybe how we could talk a little bit about some of those aspects of how people can kind of figure out how they're doing here. We have thousands of companies out in startup school land, trying to figure out what to do next, and whether they're doing the right thing. And whether they're failing, and whether they're on the right path.

杰夫·拉斯顿:我在想是什么让公司更好,什么让公司失败。我在想,也许我们可以谈谈这些方面,人们如何才能弄清楚他们在这里做得如何。我们有成千上万的公司在创业学校的土地上,试图找出下一步该做什么,以及他们是否在做正确的事情。他们是否失败了,他们是否走上了正确的道路。


Paul Graham: What makes companies fail most of the time is poor execution by the founders. Right? We often talk to startups who are worried about competitors, and one advantage of YC having funded so many companies, you have a really large data set, and how many companies have been killed by competitors? One? More than one? Out of 1900? Right? So, I tell startups that basically you have the same protection against competitors that light aircraft have against crashing into other light aircraft when flying through clouds. You know what the protection is? Space is large. Right? Those little Cessna's don't have any radar in them, you know? You can't see in clouds.

保罗·格雷厄姆:大多数情况下,公司失败的原因是创始人执行不力。对吗?我们经常与那些担心竞争对手的初创企业交谈,而YC为这么多公司提供资金的一个优势是,你有一个非常大的数据集,有多少公司被竞争对手杀死了?一不止一个?1900年以后?对吗?所以,我告诉初创公司,基本上你对竞争对手的保护和轻型机在云层飞行时撞到其他轻型飞机时的防护是一样的。你知道什么是保护吗?空间很大。对吗?那些小塞斯纳的车里没有雷达,你知道吗?你看不见云层。


Geoff Ralston: This falls under the rubric of counterintuitive advice, because one of the things that happens all the time is people come up to me and say oh my God, there's another new company. What should I ... That's in exactly my space. What should I do?

杰夫·拉斯顿:这属于违反直觉的建议的范畴,因为经常发生的事情之一是人们走到我跟前说,天啊,又有一家新公司了。我该怎么做.。正好在我的空间里。我该怎么办?



Paul Graham: Right. And it's sort of like if you're running the 100 meters, right? And suddenly there appears another lane with another runner in it. What should you do? Run as fast as you can, just like you presumably were, right? If they're better than you, they'll win, and if not then you'll win.

保罗·格雷厄姆:对。就像你跑100米一样,对吧?突然又出现了另一条车道,里面有另一位跑步者。你该怎么办?尽可能快地跑,就像你想的那样,对吧?如果他们比你强,他们就会赢,否则你就会赢。


Geoff Ralston: And that's a good reminder. Could everyone please silence your phones? If you haven't already. Yeah, what else? One of the things we do a lot is try to judge, right? And try to pick who's gonna succeed, and you guys are doing the same thing, you know? Except you're trying to pick yourselves, hopefully. What is it that makes startups succeed? That makes startups succeed?

杰夫·拉斯顿:这是个很好的提醒。请大家安静一下你的电话好吗?如果你还没有。是啊,还有什么?我们经常做的事情之一就是判断,对吧?选择谁会成功,你们也在做同样的事,你知道吗?但你只是想自己挑,希望如此。是什么让初创公司成功?才能让初创公司成功?


Paul Graham: Well, you have to start with a good founding team, ideally. Not just one person-

保罗。格雷厄姆:嗯，你必须从一个优秀的创始团队开始，理想的情况是。不只是一个人-

Geoff Ralston: That's my question-

Geoff Ralston:那是我的问题-

Paul Graham: You can do it. You can do it with one person.

保罗·格雷厄姆:你能做到的。你可以用一个人来做。

Geoff Ralston: Well, I couldn't. I couldn't. I ended up having to join other people. I actually think the vast majority-

Geoff Ralston:嗯，我不能。我不能。最后我不得不加入其他人。我真的认为绝大多数人-

Paul Graham: Oh, you tried ... That was not Rocket Mail that you were-

保罗·格雷厄姆:哦，你试过了。。。你写的不是火箭邮件-

Geoff Ralston: No, I was tech ... No. It was no way. I couldn't do it. I'm not built that way. I think most people aren't built that way. Thus my questions about Robert and Trevor, that it's just so difficult.

Geoff Ralston:不，我是技术人员。。。不，这不可能。我做不到。我不是那种人。我认为大多数人并不是这样建立的。因此，我对罗伯特和特雷弗的问题，这是如此困难。

Paul Graham: I would not try and start a startup with just myself as the founder. I don't think I could do it.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我不会尝试以我自己作为创始人来创办一家初创公司。我想我做不到。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. It's lonely enough anyway.

是的。反正也够寂寞的了。

Paul Graham: Maybe you think you can, but I couldn't. So, you need a good solid founding team who know one another well, and who can work together-

保罗·格雷厄姆:也许你认为你可以，但我不能。所以，你需要一个很好的，可靠的创始团队，他们彼此很熟悉，而且能合作-

Geoff Ralston: Just like ... Pause there. Knowing one another well, why does that even matter?

Geoff Ralston:就像……停在那儿。彼此了解，这又有什么关系呢?

Paul Graham: Because what happens in a startup will shake your relationship. If there's any sort of flakiness or uncertainty, or disloyalty, or whatever lingering in there, it will emerge under the stresses of a startup.

保罗。格雷厄姆:因为在初创公司里发生的事情会动摇你的关系。如果有任何古怪或不确定，或不忠，或任何挥之不去，它将出现在压力下的初创公司。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. It's like a marriage, only harder. You spend more time with that person-

是的。这就像一场婚姻，只是更难。你花更多的时间和那个人在一起-

Paul Graham: There's other differences.

保罗·格雷厄姆:还有其他的不同之处。

Geoff Ralston: There's ... Potentially, yeah. Okay, so you get a good founding team, you get someone who you can stand stress with.

Geoff Ralston:有。。。潜在的，是的。好吧，所以你有一个好的创始团队，你有一个可以承受压力的人。

Paul Graham: So, there's two categories of stuff, there's two categories of answers we could give here. There's the answer you give to investors about how to pick startups, and then there's only a subset of that is useful to founders, right? So, you can tell investors, you wanna pick smart people, right? But founders are as smart as they are if they've already ... What can we tell them, get smarter? Right? And actually, it turns out it's not that important to be smart. It's much, much more important to be determined. If you imagine this hypothetical person who's 100 out of 100 for smart, and 100 out of 100 for determination, right? And then you start taking away determination. It doesn't take very long before you have this sort of ineffectual brilliant person. Whereas if you take someone who's super, super determined, and you start taking away smartness bit by bit, I mean, eventually you get to some guy who owns a lot of taxi medallions, but he's still rich, right? Or like a trash hauling business or something like that, but you can take away a lot of smart.

保罗·格雷厄姆:所以,有两种类型的东西,我们可以在这里给出两类答案。你给了投资者关于如何选择初创企业的答案,然后只有一小部分对创始人有用,对吗?所以,你可以告诉投资者,你想选聪明的人,对吧?但是创建者和他们一样聪明如果他们已经.。我们能告诉他们什么,变得更聪明?对吗?事实上,聪明并不重要。这是非常,更重要的是,有待确定。如果你想象这个假设的人,100%的聪明,100%的决心,对吧?然后你开始失去决心。很快你就会有这样一个无能的聪明的人。然而,如果你带着一个超级,超级有决心的人,你开始一点地失去聪明,我的意思是,最终你找到了一个拥有很多出租车奖章的人,但他仍然很富有,对吗?或者像垃圾搬运生意之类的,但是你可以拿走很多聪明的东西。


Geoff Ralston: Yeah, you have to take a lot of smart and add ... And take away a bunch of ethics at the same time, and then you get that guy, right?

Geoff Ralston:是的，你必须变得很聪明，加上。。。。。。。。。同时拿走一堆道德规范，然后你就能得到那个人，对吧?

Paul Graham: He could be president.

保罗·格雷厄姆:他可能会成为总统。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I've been thinking about-

是的。我一直在想-

Paul Graham: Who thought that Trump would actually teach an important lesson?

保罗。格雷厄姆:谁会想到特朗普真的会给你一个重要的教训呢?

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, for startups.

Geoff Ralston:是的，对于初创公司来说。

Paul Graham: It's all about determination.

Paul Graham:这都是决心的问题。

Geoff Ralston: I was thinking about these axes we think about, and those are two. The intelligence axis or the determination axis. And obviously if you were really intelligent, really determined, that's awesome. There's-

Geoff Ralston:我在想我们所想到的这些轴，它们是两个。智力轴或决定轴。很明显，如果你真的很聪明，真的很坚定，那就太棒了。有-

Paul Graham: Oh, by the way. Only one person has to be super determined.

保罗·格雷厄姆:哦，顺便说一句。只有一个人必须被超级决定。

Geoff Ralston: Right.

好的。

Paul Graham: Right? So, you know, you could have one person who really wants to start the company and one person-

Paul Graham:对吗? 所以，你知道，你可以拥有一个真正想要开公司的人和一个-

Geoff Ralston: You and Robert.

你和罗伯特。

Paul Graham: Exactly. Who after a month is like what? We're still working on this?

完全正确。一个月后谁是什么样的人? 我们还在搞这个?

Geoff Ralston: That depends on this tight bond where you can drag that person along with you. Otherwise, they'll go away. But I was thinking, there's actually another axis, which is you have to have the ability somewhere on your team to project, because your idea's gonna suck, and then it'll suck less and less. And so, you have to have the ability to think where should we ... To navigate. You have to have some sort of creativity that allows you to make the right choices, and-

Geoff Ralston:那要看你能把那个人和你一起拖拉的紧密联系了。否则，他们会离开的。但我在想，其实还有一个轴心，那就是你必须在团队中的某个地方有能力去设计，因为你的想法会变差，然后就会变得越来越差。所以，你必须有能力去思考我们应该。。。导航。你必须有某种创造力，让你做出正确的选择，而且-

Paul Graham: No, no. Actually you might not have to be that creative. If you care enough about users, you can just follow what will make users happy the way a scientist follows the truth, and eventually, without much thinking on your part, the need to grow will give you this product idea that's actually the product, it's the result of evolution.

Paul Graham:不，不。实际上，你可能不必那么有创造力。如果你足够关心用户，你就可以按照科学家遵循真理的方式去做让用户高兴的事情，最终，如果你不多加思考，增长的需求将会给你产品的概念，那就是产品，它是进化的结果。

Geoff Ralston: So, maybe you're either sort of Steve Jobs and can intuit what customers need, or you just have to have the skill of actually talking to customers and understanding what their saying, which isn't always obvious.

Geoff Ralston:所以，也许你要么是史蒂夫·乔布斯，要么就是你能直觉地知道客户需要什么，或者你必须具备与客户真正交谈并理解他们所说的话的技能，这一点并不总是显而易见的。

Paul Graham: Well, you know Steve Jobs' trick was he satisfied users too, except he was the user. It's like I don't wanna have any phone jack anymore, so no more phone jacks for anybody. Right?

PaulGraham:你知道，史蒂夫•乔布斯的伎俩是，他也让用户满意，除了他是用户。好像我不想再有电话插孔了，所以别再给任何人打电话插孔了。对吧?

Geoff Ralston: And maybe he was just lucky that his desires were generic enough that it was good for everybody.

Geoff Ralston:也许他只是运气好，因为他的欲望很普通，对每个人都有好处。

Paul Graham: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was living in the future.

Paul Graham:是的，是的，是的。他活在未来。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, except he didn't really like the internet except for reading the New York Times, so he never really got that right.

Geoff Ralston:是的，除了看“纽约时报”之外，他并不喜欢互联网，所以他从来没有真正喜欢过互联网。

Paul Graham: Interesting. Didn't you ... You worked at Apple at one point, after you got bought.

Paul Graham:有意思。你不是。。。你在苹果工作过一段时间，在你被收买之后。

Geoff Ralston: I did. For six months.

是我做的。六个月。

Paul Graham: What was it like? What was Steve like? Could you tell from where you were in Apple what Steve was like?

Paul Graham:是什么感觉? 史蒂夫是什么样的人? 你能从你在苹果的位置看出史蒂夫是什么样子吗?

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I got to talk to him a few times. He's different.

是的。我得和他谈几次。他不一样。

Paul Graham: Tell us, tell us how. Are there useful lessons you can learn from him? Or is he a one-off?

Paul Graham:告诉我们，告诉我们怎么做。你能从他身上学到什么有用的教训吗? 还是他是一次性的?

Geoff Ralston: I wouldn't presume ... I only met with him a handful of times, and I wouldn't presume to know too much about him-

Geoff Ralston:我不认为。。。我只和他见过几次面，我也不认为我对他了解太多-

Paul Graham: Yeah, you had a lot of indirect evidence in stories and stuff like that.

保罗。格雷厄姆:是的，你在故事和诸如此类的东西中有很多间接的证据。

Geoff Ralston: A couple, yeah.

一对，是的。

Paul Graham: One is about that.

Paul Graham:一个是关于那个的。

Geoff Ralston: About being nice, yeah.

吉奥夫·罗尔斯顿:关于友善的事，是的。

Paul Graham: There's also one called Be Good.

保罗。格雷厄姆:也有一个叫“be good”的词。

Geoff Ralston: Be good, right. And I don't think he would have passed the test, especially when he was younger. Which is ... I worry about that because it's true that it's usually good to be nice, and friendly, and benevolent. He wasn't.

好好表现，对吧。我不认为他会通过考试，尤其是在他年轻的时候。这是。。。我担心，因为这是真的，它通常是好的，友好，和仁慈。他不是。

Paul Graham: Maybe if YC had caught him early.

保罗·格雷厄姆:要是YC早点抓住他，也许就好了。

Geoff Ralston: We could've helped?

我们能帮上忙吗?

Paul Graham: Maybe.

也许吧。

Geoff Ralston: But maybe that was part of what made him successful in the beginning, I don't know.

Geoff Ralston:但我不知道，也许这是他一开始成功的原因之一。

Paul Graham: I don't know, I don't know.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我不知道，我不知道。

Geoff Ralston: It worked for Donald Trump.

Geoff Ralston:这对唐纳德·特朗普是有效的。

Paul Graham: Donald Trump, that's a different kinda business.

保罗。格雷厄姆:唐纳德。特朗普，那是另一种生意。

Geoff Ralston: That's a bad example, right?

Geoff Ralston:这是个坏例子，对吗?

Paul Graham: Yeah. Donald Trump is a name we should avoid. In business, determination matters more, but business is not identical with startups.

Paul Graham:是的。唐纳德·特朗普是我们应该避免的名字。在商业上，决心更重要，但商业与初创公司并不完全一样。

Geoff Ralston: I wanna leave these guys some time to ask questions. But I want ... What are they gonna get wrong? What mistakes will these people make that maybe, maybe hearing them might help? It probably won't because you won't listen, but-

Geoff Ralston:我想给这些人留点时间问问题。但我想。。。他们会犯什么错? 这些人会犯什么错误，也许听他们说会有帮助? 可能不会，因为你不听，但是-

Paul Graham: What you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention to users. You will make up some idea in your own head that you will call your vision, and then you will spend a lot of time thinking about your vision in a café, by yourself, and write, build some elaborate thing without going and talking to users, because that's doing sales, which is a pain in the ass, and they might say no, and you'd be way better off finding someone, anyone, who has a problem that they will pay you to fix and fixing it, and then seeing if you can find more people like that. Best case is if you yourself have the problem, right? But you will not ship fast enough, because you don't wanna face the ... You're embarrassed to ship something unfinished, and you don't wanna face the likely feedback that you will get from shipping.

PaulGraham:你会犯错的是你不会对用户给予足够的关注。你会在自己的脑海里想出一个主意，你会把自己的想法称为愿景，然后你会花很多时间在咖啡馆里想自己的愿景，自己去写，不和用户聊天地做一些精心制作的东西，因为这是在做销售，这是一个麻烦，他们可能会说不，你最好找到一个，任何人，谁，谁有问题，你会发现，如果你可以解决它。最好的情况是你自己有问题，对吗? 但你不会船得太快，因为你不想面对。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。你不想

Geoff Ralston: It's humbling and humiliating when they tell you how shitty what you've built actually is, right? But that's the only way you get it better.

Geoff Ralston:当他们告诉你你实际上建造的东西有多糟糕时，这是一种谦卑和羞辱，对吧? 但这是唯一能让你变得更好的方法。

Paul Graham: Yeah. So, you will shrink from contact with the real world. Or contact with your users. That's the mistake you will make.

Paul Graham:是的。所以，你会因为与现实世界的接触而退缩。或者和你的用户联系。那是你会犯的错误。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. There's a Paul Graham-ism in there which is all around launching fast, launching before you're ready. I sometimes tell people the story of-

是的。那里有一个保罗格雷厄姆主义，它围绕着快速上线，在你准备好之前上线。我有时会告诉别人-

Paul Graham: It's Reed Hoffman, actually, who hounded ... Who harped on that one early. Not me. I think he said if you're not embarrassed with what you launched, then you launched too late.

保罗。格雷厄姆:事实上，是里德。霍夫曼。。。他很早就说了。不是我。我想他说如果你不为你推出的东西感到尴尬，那么你推出得太晚了。

Geoff Ralston: I remember when I was joining Y Combinator, and at the same time, this is not necessarily a good idea, launching Imagine K12, this ed tech version of YC, and I came in to talk to Paul, and he's like so, how's it going with Imagine K12? Because he helped out a lot, and I said, "Oh, it's going well"-

我还记得当我加入Y Combinator的时候，这不一定是一个好主意，它推出了IMAGIXK12，这是YC的Ed Tech版本，我是来和Paul谈谈的，他是这样的，IMAGIXK12怎么样了? 因为他帮了我很多忙，我说，“哦，一切都很好”-

Paul Graham: I think it was probably called something else at that point.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我想在那个时候它可能叫别的什么东西。

Geoff Ralston: Well, no, no, no, it was still ... By then, you'd already ... He actually gave us the name Imagine K12, and so it was called Imagine K12, and was like when are you gonna launch? And I was like well, working on our PR plan, and we're finishing the software, so ... This was like ... We were gonna have a summer batch, and this was probably in February or something, and I said, "Probably in like six weeks." He said, "Why don't you just launch? Why don't you just launch now?" And I was like, damn. He just did it to me. And we did, we launched within a week, we launched. And so, that is a mistake you'll make. You'll wait too long, you'll be embarrassed. You'll ...

Geoff Ralston:不，不，不，它仍然。。。到那时，你已经。。。他实际上给了我们一个名字，想像K12，所以它叫想像K12，你打算什么时候上线? 我说得很好，在我们的公关计划中，我们正在完成软件，所以。。。这就像。。。我们将有一个夏季批，这可能是在二月或什么，我说，“可能在六个星期。” 他说:“你为什么不直接上线呢?为什么不现在上线呢?” 我就想，妈的。他就是这么对我的。我们做了，我们在一周内上线了，我们上线了。所以，这是你会犯的错误。你等得太久了，你会很尴尬的。你会。。。

Paul Graham: We launched YC probably in less than a week of having the idea. Of course, launching it was merely posting a website, and we didn't have any software in the beginning. We just had this [ascii] form that people would fill out and reply to us by email. The first couple of batches, the applications were by email. And we would print them out, and pass them around amongst the partners, and we would all write grades on the top, like we were grading papers. And then we would sort this heap of papers, and that was the application process.

PaulGraham:我们推出YC可能不到一周就有了这个想法。当然，发布它仅仅是发布一个网站，我们一开始没有任何软件。我们刚刚收到一份[ASCII]表格，人们会通过电子邮件填写并回复我们。最初的几批申请是通过电子邮件提交的。我们会把它们打印出来，传给合作伙伴，然后在上面写分数，就像我们在给论文评分一样。然后我们会对这堆文件进行分类，这就是申请过程。

Geoff Ralston: Talk about doing things that don't scale. Try to do that with thousands of applications now. It would be harder. So, we have lots of software that does that, because eventually you scale.

Geoff Ralston:谈论做的事情不是可扩展的。现在尝试对成千上万的应用程序这样做。会更难。所以，我们有很多软件可以做到这一点，因为最终你的规模。

Paul Graham: Yeah.

Paul Graham:是的。

Geoff Ralston: Eventually you build software when you learn what software you oughta be building. It'd be fun to spend a lot of time, more time, talking about how YC got started, but I think rather than that-

Geoff Ralston:最终，当你知道你应该构建什么软件时，你就会构建软件。花大量的时间，更多的时间，讨论YC是如何开始的，但我认为不是那样-

Paul Graham: How much time do we have left?

保罗·格雷厄姆:我们还有多少时间?

Geoff Ralston: We can probably go to around 12, and ... Videos that get too long are no one wants to watch anyway, so we're already been going for about 40 minutes or so. So, let's open up to any questions you guys might have. Yeah.

Geoff Ralston:我们大概可以去12岁左右的地方，而且。。。。。。。。。。。。时间太长的视频也没人想看，所以我们已经看了大约40分钟了。所以，让我们对你们可能有的任何问题敞开心扉。是啊。

Speaker 3: My question is about hiring co-founders. So, in the complex B says most likely you have a lot of very successful friends that might wanna join you, and you kinda work with them in building something. But you're risking losing basically that person, and if you run out and hire someone from the street who's a co-founder, and technically savvy, then you might risk him breaking the company later, you know? So, it's kind of like sometimes it's more risk actually-

演讲者3:我的问题是雇佣联合创始人。所以，在复合体B中，很有可能你有很多非常成功的朋友，他们可能想加入你，你可以和他们一起构建一些东西。但是你在冒着失去那个人的风险，如果你走出去，从街上雇佣一个有共同创始人和技术头脑的人，那么你可能会冒着被他打垮公司的风险，你知道吗? 所以，就好像有时候更冒险-

Paul Graham: Are you saying that if you recruit your co-founder, your friends as co-founders, you might lose them as friends?

保罗。格雷厄姆:你是说如果你招募你的共同创始人，你的朋友作为共同创始人，你可能会失去他们作为朋友?

Speaker 3: I mean-

演讲者3:我的意思是-

Paul Graham: I don't think that that's a big danger. I don't think you have-

保罗·格雷厄姆:我不认为这是一个很大的危险。我不认为你有-

Geoff Ralston: So, the question was should I have my friends be co-founders and then maybe risk losing them as friends? Or should I just take someone off the street where I don't have the risk of losing them as friends, but they might break my company. Was that your question? Did I get that right?

Geoff Ralston:那么，问题是我应该让我的朋友成为联合创始人，然后可能会失去他们作为朋友的风险? 或者我是不是应该把一个我没有失去他们作为朋友的风险的人从街上带走，但他们可能会破坏我的公司。这是你的问题吗? 我说的对吗?

Speaker 3: Yes you did.

演讲者3:是的，你做到了。

Paul Graham: I already answered it, dude. Come on.

Paul Graham:我已经回答了，伙计。别这样。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, I just wanna make sure they heard the question too, just because-

Geoff Ralston:是的，我只是想确定他们也听到了这个问题，因为-

Paul Graham: I repeated the question.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我重复了一遍这个问题。

Geoff Ralston: Yes. Go.

Geoff Ralston:是的。去吧。

Speaker 4: How do you deal with different ... So, I guess it's a two part question. One is, how do you deal with different commitment levels with being co-founders? And also, if you had to fire a co-founder, how would you go about it?

演讲者4:你如何处理不同的……所以，我想这是一个两部分的问题。一个是，你如何处理与共同创始人不同的承诺水平? 而且，如果你不得不解雇一个联合创始人，你会怎么做呢?

Geoff Ralston: How do you deal with different commitment levels of co-founders, and if you do have to fire a co-founder, what should you do?

罗尔斯顿:你如何处理不同的共同创始人的承诺水平，如果你真的要解雇一个共同创始人，你应该怎么做?

Paul Graham: Okay. So, the way you deal with different commitment levels is you ask yourself would I rather have 30% of this person, or 100% of some other person? And in my case, I would rather have 10% of Robert Morris' brain than 100% of almost anybody else's. So, it was an easy decision. How do you fire co-founders? In Y Combinator, the answer is you ask Carolyn [Levy] . Because Y Combinator, there's so much experience with dealing with crap like firing co-founders, and you just go and talk to them and they say, "Here, you do this, and this, and this", right? How do you-

保罗·格雷厄姆:好的。所以,你对待不同承诺水平的方式是问自己,我宁愿拥有这个人的30%,还是其他人的100%?就我而言,我宁愿有10%的罗伯特·莫里斯的大脑,也不愿拥有几乎所有其他人的10%的大脑。所以,这是一个简单的决定。你怎么解雇联合创始人的?在Y组合中,答案是你问Carolyn[Levy]。因为YCombinator,有很多处理类似解雇联合创始人之类的垃圾的经验,你就去和他们交谈,他们说,“在这里,你做这个,还有这个”,对吗?你怎么-



Geoff Ralston: And it's probably online, too. So, you could Google it.

Geoff Ralston:而且它可能也在网上。所以，你可以谷歌它。

Paul Graham: Really? Has YC published how to fire co-founders?

真的吗? YC出版了如何解雇联合创始人吗?

Geoff Ralston: Well, we have published ... If you look at some of the talks Carolyn has given, and Christie, I'm pretty sure they've covered that particular issue. One way you deal with it, by the way, is making sure that someone has a little bit more stock per ... It's usually better to have somewhat equal shares, but not completely equal, and if one person has 51% and the other person has 49%, then they can have control.

杰夫·拉斯顿:嗯,我们已经发表了.如果你看一下卡罗琳和克里斯蒂的一些谈话,我敢肯定他们已经讨论过这个问题了。顺便说一句,你处理这件事的一种方法是确保每个人有更多的股票.通常情况下,有一些股份是比较好的,但不是完全平等,如果一个人有51%,另一个人有49%,那么他们就可以控制。


Paul Graham: You at least don't get deadlocked.

保罗·格雷厄姆:至少你不会陷入僵局。

Geoff Ralston: Yes. Yeah.

Geoff Ralston:是的。是啊。

Speaker 5: So, when you talk about launch, is launching to private beta, a couple of people, good enough? Or do you have to just launch it to public?

演讲者5:那么，当你谈论上线时，上线到私人测试版，几个人，够好了吗? 还是你非要把它公之于众?

Geoff Ralston: So, what does launch really mean?

那么，上线到底是什么意思?

Paul Graham: So, the question is, is launching in a private beta to a few people good enough? Or do you have to launch to the general public? I will take launching in just a private beta to a couple people, because that's closer to full launch than just sitting thinking of your idea in a café.

PaulGraham:那么，问题是，在一个私人测试版中向几个人发布是否足够好呢? 还是要向公众宣传? 我将在一个私人试用版中向几个人推出，因为这比坐在咖啡馆里想你的想法更接近于全面推出。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

是的。

Paul Graham: Next. Yes.

下一个。是啊。

Speaker 6: What do you think about the current fundraising and project structure with projects were ... a bunch of projects have maybe over raised, or basically the-

演讲人6:你对目前的筹款和项目结构有何看法。。。一大堆项目可能已经被抬高了，或者基本上是-

Geoff Ralston: Are you asking about ICOs? Yeah, what do you think about ICOs, Paul?

Geoff Ralston:你是在问ICOS吗? 是啊，你觉得ICOS怎么样，保罗?

Paul Graham: I have ... I know nothing about this world. I've heard there's a huge amount of Crypto money floating around. So, if there's money floating around, it's often a good idea for startups to try and get it. Beyond that, I don't know.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我。。。我对这个世界一无所知。我听说有大量的密码钱在四处流动。因此，如果有资金流动，创业公司尝试着去获得它通常是一个好主意。除此之外，我不知道。

Geoff Ralston: But I will say, one of the things we've seen a lot at Y Combinator is it's not always right to raise too much money. And even if you don't-

Geoff Ralston:但我要说的是，我们在Y Combinator看到的一件事是，筹集太多资金并不总是对的。即使你不-

Paul Graham: By definition of too, it's always wrong.

保罗·格雷厄姆:按照定义，这总是错的。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. I'll raise a lot of money, and the thing about ... There's a couple reasons for that. One, you dilute more than you necessarily need to. But the other reason is that money just sitting there has sort of a gravitational effect.

是的。我会筹到很多钱，关于。。。有几个原因。第一，你冲淡的比你需要的更多。但另一个原因是，仅仅坐在那里的钱会产生某种引力效应。

Paul Graham: It makes you-

保罗·格雷厄姆:这会让你-

Geoff Ralston: It makes you spend fast. And it makes you do stupid things, so it's like ... There's companies that have raised a billion dollars on ICOs and I don't know if they'll ever have a real company.

Geoff Ralston:这会让你花得很快。它会让你做傻事，所以就像。。。有些公司在iCOS上募集了10亿美元，我不知道他们是否会有一个真正的公司。

Paul Graham: Or you get a bunch of LPs and raise a billion dollars, and then you just hire so many more people than you actually need, right?

保罗·格雷厄姆:或者你得到了一堆有限合伙人，赚了十亿美元，然后你就会雇佣比你实际需要的更多的人，对吗?

Speaker 7: It's usually not equity though. It's usually not equity.

演讲者7:但这通常不公平。通常不是公平。

Geoff Ralston: That's what I was saying. That's the difference with ICO. I get it, but just having a billion dollars when you only barely have an idea is not necessarily ... Magic Leap raised 2.3 billion dollars, and they seem to have almost nothing.

Geoff Ralston:这就是我说的。这就是ICO的区别。我明白，但仅仅拥有10亿美元，而你几乎没有一个想法并不一定。。。神奇的飞跃筹集了23亿美元，他们似乎什么也没有。

Paul Graham: By the way, that is the trick for getting your question answered. I learned that a long time ago. You raise your hand as people are finishing the proceeding question, and I see that guy's hand over there. He knows the trick. Go ahead. What is it?

保罗·格雷厄姆:顺便说一句，这是让你的问题得到解答的秘诀。我很久以前就知道了。你举起你的手，因为人们正在完成程序问题，我看到那家伙的手在那里。他知道诀窍。去吧。这是什么?

Speaker 8: What are your best tips for a great user interview?

演讲者8:对于一个优秀的用户面试，你最好的建议是什么?

Paul Graham: My best tips for a great user interview? Well, you wanna figure out not just what they think is wrong, but what's actually wrong. What's missing in their life, right? So, just start talking to them. Say what would you like to do? What would you like to be able to do that you can't? And they might just ... they'll tend to give you an answer that's like a subset, right? Like if you were asking someone about email, they'd like to say I like ... It's really important to me to be able the mark emails as unread, right? I'm like, what does it mean unread? That whole unread thing is a sign the whole inbox is being misused. What's really going on is it's a to-do list, you know? And that's why you have to mark items as unread so they stay on your to-do list. And so, you could ... So you start asking them with what's wrong, and then you try and figure out what they really mean, what they're really getting at, which they themselves might not know, you know? And then you start asking them so, what if you could do such and such? What if you could do such and such, right? So, start by asking them questions about their life, and then get hypothetical on them. Okay, we should ask someone on this side.

保罗·格雷厄姆:我对一个伟大的用户访谈最好的建议是什么?好吧,你不仅想弄清楚他们认为什么是错的,还想弄清楚到底是什么错了。他们生命中缺少了什么,对吧?那就跟他们谈谈吧。说你想做什么?你想做什么你不能做的事?他们可能只是.。他们会给你一个类似子集的答案,对吧?如果你问别人关于电子邮件的事,他们会说我喜欢.对我来说很重要的是能把标记邮件当作未读的,对吧?我就像,不读是什么意思?那整件未读的东西是整个收件箱被滥用的标志。到底是怎么回事,你知道吗?这就是为什么你必须将项目标记为未阅读,以便它们留在你的待办事项清单上。所以你可以.。所以你开始问他们出了什么问题,然后你试着找出他们真正的意思,他们真正得到了什么,而他们自己可能不知道,你知道吗?然后你开始问他们,如果你能这样做呢?如果你能这样做,对吧?所以,先问他们关于他们生活的问题,然后对他们进行假设。好吧,我们应该问问这边的人。

Geoff Ralston: You've taken over, so you just keep calling them. You're doing great. You pick. Go ahead.

Geoff Ralston:你已经接管了，所以你就一直打电话给他们。你做得很好。你选。去吧。

Paul Graham: All right. Right there in the way corner.

Paul Graham:好吧。就在路的拐角处。

Speaker 9: This is actually kind of off one of the questions that somebody else asked earlier. So, you talked about launching early, right? How do you justify the financial risk and turbulence because of launching a shitty product?

演讲者9:这实际上是一个别人之前问过的问题。所以，你说要提前上线，对吧? 你如何证明由于推出一个糟糕的产品而带来的金融风险和动荡?

Paul Graham: How do you justify the financial risk of launching a shitty product?

PaulGraham:你如何证明推出一个糟糕产品的财务风险?

Speaker 9: Not entirely shitty product, or something half baked rather.

演讲者9:不完全是垃圾产品，或者是半熟的东西。

Paul Graham: Okay. So, the risk of launching early is not as great as the risk of launching late. It's not like there's only risk on one side, right? There's a risk of launching late, too. So, you gotta have a rule of thumb about when to launch, and my rule of thumb, the way I ... I have this phrase for it that didn't become as sticky as minimum viable product, because it describes what the minimum viable product has. But it's a quantum of utility, right? Launch as soon as you have a quantum of utility, which means as soon as there's one person in the world who is glad that you launched, because now they can do something that they couldn't do. If you have something that if you launched it, no one would be happy, then you're not ready to launch, right? As soon as there's at least somebody out there who would say oh, here's this thing I can use, because I can do X, and before that I couldn't do it, then you should launch. As soon as you have a quantum of utility.

保罗·格雷厄姆:好的。因此,早发射的风险并不像延迟发射的风险那么大。不是只有一方有风险,对吧?也有晚发射的危险。所以,你必须有一个关于什么时候发射的经验法则,我.我有这样的说法,因为它不像最小可行的产品那么粘稠,因为它描述了最起码可行的产品有什么。但这是一个实用的量子,对吗?一旦你有了实用价值,就立即启动,这意味着世界上只要有一个人为你的发射感到高兴,因为现在他们可以做一些他们做不到的事情。如果你有什么东西,如果你发射,没有人会高兴,那么你还没有准备好发射,对吗?至少有一个人会说,哦,这是我可以用的东西,因为我可以做X,在那之前我做不到,那么你应该发射。一旦你有了实用价值。


Geoff Ralston: It sounds like there's almost utility function. Like if it makes too many people happy, and one person happy, and 100 really unhappy, maybe it's not ready. But if you ... Paul Bucheit always says if you have 10 people who really love your product, that's a good place to be.

Geoff Ralston:听起来好像有差不多的效用函数。就像如果它让太多的人开心，一个人开心，100个人真的不开心，也许它还没准备好。但是如果你。。。保罗·布切特总是说，如果你有10个真正喜欢你的产品的人，那是一个好地方。

Paul Graham: Yeah, all you need is ... If there's 10 people who are super excited, totally, totally launch. And nobody else cares, that is perfectly fine, that is great. Okay, yes.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的，你所需要的是……如果有10个人非常兴奋，完全，完全地启动。没有人在乎，那是完全正常的，那是伟大的。好吧，是的。

Speaker 10: Can you talk about the difference between the [inaudible] build what they want versus what customers need? So, most of the time the want maybe very short sighted, whereas the need maybe people are wanting, they have some unintended consequences. So, how do you deal with building what they really need versus what they really want?

演讲者10:你能说说[听不见的]构建他们想要的和顾客需要的之间的区别吗? 所以，大多数情况下，想要的人可能是短视的，而需要的人可能是想要的，他们会有一些意想不到的后果。那么，你如何处理构建他们真正需要的东西和他们真正想要的东西呢?

Paul Graham: Well, the danger of building ... Okay, so the question is how do you decide between building what people need and building what people want, right? Well, the problem is what you really wanna be doing is build something people will choose to use, or buy, or become your user, or something like that. And so, here's a counter example to the whole need versus want thing. What people need is healthy food. What people buy is unhealthy food. So, if you're a business, which one do you wanna do, right? I mean, yeah, ideally you wanna make health food that also tastes good, right? But really, you can't push this too far. You can't push this too far. I mean, I myself would not start some company making junk food or something like that, but if you are making food, don't ... Or something where need and want are very different, be real careful about picking need, you know? Or you'll go out and you know, your goal will be to cleanse the world of sin, or something like that.

保罗·格雷厄姆:嗯，建设的危险……好吧，问题是，你如何在建设人们需要的东西和建设人们想要的东西之间做出决定，对吗? 嗯，问题是你真正想做的是建立一些人们会选择使用，购买，或成为你的用户，或类似的东西。所以，这里有一个关于需求和需求的反例。人们需要的是健康的食物。人们买的是不健康的食物。所以，如果你是一个企业，你想做哪一个，对吗? 我是说，是的，最理想的是你想做健康食品，味道也很好，对吧? 但真的，你不能把它推得太远。你不能把事情推得太远。我是说，我自己也不会开一些公司来生产垃圾食品之类的东西，但是如果你在生产食品，不要。。。或者在需要和想要的东西很不一样的地方，你知道，在挑选需要的时候要非常小心。或者你会走出去，你知道，你的目标将是净化世界的罪恶，或类似的东西。

Geoff Ralston: Yeah, it's easy to delude yourself as a founder to think you're building something-

杰夫·拉斯顿:是啊,你很容易自欺欺人,以为你在建造某种东西-

Paul Graham: Yeah. The other danger is what they need is what you think they need. What you're implicitly talking about is what you think they need. Cleanse the world of your definition of sin, right? Yes. Yeah.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是的。另一个危险是他们需要的是你认为他们需要的。你含蓄地说的是你认为他们需要的东西。清除你对罪恶的定义,对吧?是嗯


Speaker 11: My name is [inaudible] , I'm working on smart technologies. My question is, when I'm work on my project, sometimes I'm seeing different problems and different, my mind, thinking different solutions. Is that normal as a founder?

演讲者11:我的名字叫[听不见]，我正在研究智能技术。我的问题是，当我在做我的项目时，有时我会看到不同的问题和不同的想法，思考不同的解决方案。作为创始人这正常吗?

Paul Graham: Is it normal as a founder to see multiple different solutions? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. You just have to pick one. Pick the one that you think could get usage quickest.

PaulGraham:作为创始人，看到多种不同的解决方案是正常的吗? 是啊，当然。绝对的。你只要选一个就行了。挑一个你认为可以最快使用的。

Speaker 11: [inaudible] . What's a founder DNA?

发言者11:[不能听到]。创立者的DNA是什么?

Paul Graham: What's the founder DNA?

保罗·格雷厄姆:创立者的DNA是什么?

Speaker 11: Explain founder DNA.

演讲者11:解释创始人DNA。

Paul Graham: Founder DNA.

Paul Graham:创立者DNA。

Speaker 11: Founders DNA, basically character, and-

演讲者11:创始人DNA，主要是性格，还有-

Geoff Ralston: Oh, what makes someone a founder?

Geoff Ralston:哦，是什么让一个人成为创始人?

Speaker 11: Yes.

发言者11:是的。

Geoff Ralston: They choose to be one.

他们选择成为一个。

Speaker 11: And what was your explanation?

演讲者11:你的解释是什么?

Paul Graham: What makes someone a good founder? A combination of positive and negative things, I think. Positive things are things like determination, and willingness to try new things. But then there may also be negative things. Like if you are ... I think if you have worked for a large company for 20 years, you might not be a founder unless you were forced to for Visa reasons, because if you were the kind of person that would make a good founder, you wouldn't be able to stand working for a large company for 20 years, right? And so, actually we've noticed certain companies where the alumni of these companies tend to make bad founders, and it's because no one who would make a good founder could have stood working for these companies for very long. Okay, maybe we should pick one on this side.

保罗·格雷厄姆:是什么让一个人成为一个优秀的创始人? 我认为是积极和消极的结合。积极的东西是像决心，和愿意尝试新的东西。但也可能有负面的东西。如果你是。。。我想如果你在一家大公司工作了20年，你可能不会成为一个创始人，除非你因为签证的原因而被迫这样做，因为如果你是那种能成为一个好的创始人的人，你就不能在一家大公司工作20年，对吗? 因此，实际上我们注意到了某些公司，这些公司的校友往往是糟糕的创始人，这是因为谁要成为一个好的创始人，谁也不可能站在这些公司工作了很长时间。好吧，也许我们应该在这边选一个。

Geoff Ralston: We'll take a few more questions.

我们再问几个问题。

Paul Graham: Okay, yes, go ahead.

保罗·格雷厄姆:好的，好的，请便。

Speaker 12: Okay, the question is pricing during launch is especially important to me because I have a successful offline business that I'm taking online. The overall question for of us is any strategies about pricing during launch?

演讲者12:好的，问题是在发布期间定价对我来说特别重要，因为我有一个成功的离线业务，我正在网上进行。对我们来说，总的问题是在产品推出时有什么定价策略吗?

Paul Graham: What do you price during launch? Well, you can probably guess. If you know your business, you know roughly what you should charge, so you should probably just go with whatever you guess. If you wanna be more scientific about it, you could try talking to some potential users. Most of the time you have some sort of tame users who are actual users, but are also friends of yours or something like that, or family, and you can ask them. Tell me honestly, what would you actually pay for this, right? You can always change your prices later, though. If you wanna lower your prices, no one's going to complain. And if you wanna raise your prices, you just grandfather your existing users, which if you have exponential growth will always be a tiny subset of your total users, and then no one will complain about that either. So, don't sweat about it too much.

保罗·格雷厄姆:发射期间你们的价格是多少?你大概可以猜到。如果你知道你的生意,你大概知道你应该收多少钱,所以你应该随心所欲地去做。如果你想对它更科学,你可以尝试与一些潜在的用户交谈。大多数时候,你有一些驯服的用户,他们是真正的用户,但也是你的朋友或类似的东西,或者家人,你可以问他们。老实告诉我,你会为此付出多少代价,对吧?不过,你以后总是可以改变价格的。如果你想降价,没人会抱怨的。如果你想提高你的价格,你只需要你现有的用户,如果你有指数增长的话,它将永远是你的总用户的一个很小的子集,然后没有人会抱怨这一点。所以,不要为此担心太多。


Geoff Ralston: One way I think about that is it just seems like in the beginning what you need more than anything is customers, and you want them to pay. So, you need to pick a price that gets you customers, because you'll learn so much from those customers, and you can change later, right?

Geoff Ralston:我的一个想法是，一开始，你最需要的是顾客，而你想要他们付钱。所以，你需要选择一个价格，让你的客户，因为你会从这些客户学到很多，你可以改变，对吗?

Paul Graham: Definitely don't overcharge. Don't lose-

保罗·格雷厄姆:绝对不要收费过高。别输-

Geoff Ralston: Get customers.

找到顾客。

Paul Graham: ... Users over price. Yeah. Because in the beginning you just want growth. Because the customers teach you. The first customers don't just give you money, they teach you.

保罗·格雷厄姆:。。。用户高于价格。是啊。因为一开始你只想要成长。因为顾客会教你。第一批顾客不仅给你钱，他们还教你。

Geoff Ralston: All right, two more questions.

好了，还有两个问题。

Paul Graham: You pick two.

保罗·格雷厄姆:你选两个。

Geoff Ralston: Okay, right up front here.

好的，就在前面。

Karen: Angel investing. So, my name's Karen, and I'm with Chat Goose, and which is a chat manager. So, three tips for dealing with and finding angel investors, if you don't have the rich uncles, et cetera.

天使投资。所以，我的名字叫凯伦，和我在聊天鹅，这是一个聊天经理。因此，如果你没有有钱的叔叔，那么有三个处理和寻找天使投资者的小贴士，等等。

Geoff Ralston: Well, we never talked about fundraising at all, wow. Maybe we'll have to do this whole thing again.

Geoff Ralston:嗯，我们根本没谈过筹款的事，哇。也许我们得再做一次。

Paul Graham: That's good. Fund fundraising is a thing to occupy your thoughts as a founder. It's overrated. It's better not to be spending all your time thinking about fundraising.

保罗·格雷厄姆:很好。作为一个创始人，筹款是占据你思想的一件事。被高估了。最好不要把所有的时间都花在筹款上。

Geoff Ralston: And we come to it much later in the class, so we don't need to.

Geoff Ralston:我们很晚才在课堂上讲到这个问题，所以我们不需要讲这个问题。

Paul Graham: All right. So, the question was how to find angel investors? Well, that's the thing, I'm particularly ill-suited to answering that question, because Y Combinator is like this machine for funneling angel investors into all the startups that it accepts. So, how do you find angel investors if you don't? It's like asking a pilot how to walk along a track on the ground. I know the least about that.

Paul Graham:好吧。那么，问题是如何找到天使投资者呢? 嗯，这就是问题所在，我特别不适合回答这个问题，因为Y Combinator就像这台机器，可以吸引天使投资者进入它所接受的所有初创公司。那么，如果你找不到天使投资者，你是怎么找到的呢? 这就像问飞行员如何沿着地面的轨道走一样。我一点也不知道。

Geoff Ralston: Here's the thing, angel investors are looking for you. So, get out there. Go to ... I don't know. Well, there's lots of startup events, angels are ... They're not necessarily good angels, but angels are out there looking, and look, the best way to actually meet angels is to get one to invest in you and then to introduce you to people they know.

杰夫罗尔斯顿:这里的事情，天使投资者正在寻找你。所以，出去吧。去。。。我不知道。嗯，有很多创业活动，天使们。。。他们不一定是好的天使，但天使们在那里寻找，看，真正与天使见面的最好方式是让一个人投资于你，然后把你介绍给他们认识的人。

Paul Graham: Oh actually, I know the answer to this. I know the answer. Find people who work at startups and ask them to introduce you to their investors. That's the way to do it.

Paul Graham:哦，事实上，我知道这个问题的答案。我知道答案。找那些在初创公司工作的人，让他们把你介绍给他们的投资者。就是这么做的。

Geoff Ralston: That's a good answer. Okay. Last question, Paul, you get to choose, maybe from this side.

Geoff Ralston:这是个好答案。好吧。最后一个问题，保罗，你可以从这边来选择。

Paul Graham: Okay, right there.

保罗·格雷厄姆:好的，就在那儿。

Speaker 14: It's a trend in the valley where companies are starting to hire people without college degrees. Are you guys thinking of going after high school students to fund?

演讲者14:这是硅谷的一个趋势，在那里，公司开始雇佣没有大学学位的人。你们是不是打算在高中毕业后去资助?

Paul Graham: Is YC thinking of going after high school students to fund? Well, I don't know, because I don't think on behalf of YC anymore. But you better not be. Because that would be an evil thing to do. High school students could ... There are plenty of high school students who could start successful startups, but they shouldn't. Just because you could start a successful startup doesn't mean you should, because if you start a successful startup, that means the footloose and fancy free days of your life are over, right? You're working for that company.

保罗·格雷厄姆:YC是不是想在高中毕业后为学生提供资金? 我不知道，因为我再也不代表YC了。但你最好别这样。因为那会是件坏事。高中生可以。。。有很多高中生可以开始成功的创业，但他们不应该。仅仅因为你可以启动一个成功的创业公司并不意味着你应该这样做，因为如果你启动了一个成功的创业公司，那就意味着你生活中自由自由的日子已经结束了，对吗? 你在为那家公司工作。

Geoff Ralston: We have funded kids in high school, but only because they're already going. We're not encouraging ... I agree, to go to high school and encourage kids to do this incredibly hard thing instead of having fun, and being kids, that's awful. I actually think that it's-

Geoff Ralston:我们为高中的孩子们提供了资金，但这只是因为他们已经在上学了。我们不鼓励。。。我同意，去高中，鼓励孩子们去做这件难以置信的困难的事情，而不是去找乐子，做个孩子，这太可怕了。我真的觉得-

Paul Graham: It's premature optimization too, right? What you should be doing when you're in high school, and even college, is you should be figuring out what the options are, not picking one option and running with it. Right?

保罗·格雷厄姆:这也是过早的优化，对吗? 当你在高中，甚至是大学的时候，你应该做的是，你应该弄清楚选择是什么，而不是选择一个选择，然后用它去跑步。对吧?

Geoff Ralston: And it just turns out that usually people who are in school and stop to start companies ... There are dropouts from Harvard, we know the classic examples, but if you drop out and just go do it, and you're on a path, that's one thing. But most people, they're dabbling, and they have a fallback, and that's not a good way to be a startup founder. You have to be 100% committed. And so, we'll fund people in college, maybe even high school if they're already clearly 100% committed. Otherwise, no. Whatever trend ... I think that trend you're talking about is that you graduate from high school, and why bother getting a college degree because you're already a fantastic hacker, so I'm going to hire you. And if that person wants to enter the professional workforce, well, that's great.

Geoff Ralston:事实证明，通常情况下，学校里的人会停下来开公司。。。。。。。。。我们知道有很多从哈佛辍学的人，我们知道最经典的例子，但是如果你辍学了，就直接去做，而你又走上了一条路，那是一回事。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。我们知道。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。但大多数人，他们是涉猎，他们有一个退路，这不是一个好的方式，作为一个初创公司创始人。你必须百分之百的投入。因此，我们将资助大学里的人，如果他们已经100%的承诺，甚至高中。否则，不。不管是什么趋势。。。我想你所说的趋势就是你高中毕业了，为什么要费心去获得大学学位，因为你已经是一个很棒的黑客了，所以我会雇用你。如果那个人想加入专业的员工队伍，那太好了。

Paul Graham: I don't know. I was ... I don't think it would've been good for me-

我不知道。我是。。。我不认为这对我有什么好处-

Geoff Ralston: It wouldn't have been good for me either, but-

Geoff Ralston:这对我也不好，但是-

Paul Graham: To go off and start some startup-

保罗?格雷厄姆:去创业吧-

Geoff Ralston: I do think between 18 and 22, you grow a lot as a human being, who's human, and humane. And it's not clear what society will turn into if all those folks enter the workforce.

Geoff Ralston:我确实认为在18岁到22岁之间，你会成长为一个人类，一个有人性的人。如果所有这些人都进入劳动力市场，社会会变成什么样子还不清楚。

Paul Graham: It's good to mess around and do a whole bunch of different things in your early 20s.

保罗。格雷厄姆:在你二十出头的时候，到处乱搞，做一大堆不同的事情，真是太好了。

Geoff Ralston: If you can afford it, yeah.

Geoff Ralston:如果你负担得起的话，是的。

Paul Graham: Whether this messing around and doing a whole bunch of things takes the form of college or something else, just don't ... Be careful. Because starting a startup is like catching a dragon by the tail if it works. Right? Be careful at what point in your life you do that.

保罗·格雷厄姆:不管是搞砸了，做了一大堆事情，是大学还是别的什么，都不要。。。小心点。因为启动一个初创公司就像抓住一条龙的尾巴，如果它有效的话。对吧? 在人生的哪个阶段你要小心。

Geoff Ralston: Paul, thank you very much for coming in.

杰夫:保罗，非常感谢你能来。

Paul Graham: Thank you, Jeff.

Paul Graham:谢谢你，杰夫。
