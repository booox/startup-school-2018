# A Conversation with Ooshma Garg - Moderated by Adora Cheung

Adora Cheung: Thank you for coming today. My name is Adora. I'm one of the partners here  at Y Combinator and today we're going to have a conversation with Ooshma Garg who's  the CEO and founder of Gobble which creates and delivers 15 minute pan dinners to  you. I am personally a happy customer. It's great for people who don't have time  to do grocery shopping, prep ingredients, actually cook and then clean up afterwards. So, Gobble  started in 2011, and while it's doing pretty well today, it's growing around 100,000,000 revenue  per week, I believe. It's gone through its many ups and downs and so with  Ooshma today, I want to talk to her about a couple things.One is evolution of  her business. She's mostly been in the food business, but it's iterated business model many  times.

Adora Cheung:谢谢你今天来。我叫阿多拉。我是Y Combinator的合伙人之一，今天我们将与Ooshma Garg进行谈话，他是Gobble的首席执行官和创始人，该公司为您提供15分钟的平底锅晚餐。我个人是一个快乐的顾客。这对那些没有时间购物，准备食材，做饭，然后打扫卫生的人来说是很棒的。所以，Gobble在2011年就开始了，虽然它今天表现不错，但我相信它每周的收入大约是1亿美元。它经历了许多起起落落，所以今天我想和她谈谈几件事，一个是她生意的发展。她主要从事食品行业，但这是反复的商业模式。

And so I think it'd be interesting to talk about that and then two  is something she's an expert in, which is grit and determination. I think she's one  of the few people that I've seen that just never gives up.

所以我认为谈论这件事很有趣，然后两件事她是专家，那就是勇气和决心。我觉得她是我见过的少数几个永不放弃的人之一。

And so I  think grit and determination are one the qualities many people think they have. But when  shit hits the fan, things start to fall apart.

因此，我认为勇气和决心是许多人认为他们所具备的品质之一。但当屎撞到风扇时，事情就开始分崩离析了。

And so I think it's also  interesting to talk about. So with that, I would love to welcome Ooshma to the  stage.

所以我认为谈论这件事也很有趣。因此，我很高兴欢迎乌希玛上台。

Thank you.

谢谢。

Ooshma Garg: Thanks for having me.

欧希玛·加格：谢谢你邀请我。

Adora Cheung: Thanks.

Adora Cheung:谢谢。

Ooshma Garg: [inaudible]

Ooshma Garg：[听不见]

Adora Cheung: So, welcome Ooshma.

Adora Cheung:那么，欢迎欧希玛。

Ooshma Garg: Thank you for having me.

欧希玛·加格：谢谢你邀请我。

Adora Cheung: Thank you for coming. So maybe we can just briefly start from the very beginning.  You were a student at Stanford and I believe you started your first company then,  which was correct me if I got this wrong, is you helped students get jobs  at banks and other companies.

Adora Cheung:谢谢你的光临。所以也许我们可以从一开始就简单地开始。你是斯坦福大学的学生，我相信你在那时候创办了你的第一家公司，如果我搞错了，那就是你帮助学生在银行和其他公司找到工作。

Ooshma Garg: Yes.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。

Adora Cheung: Obviously that didn't work out, and you did Gobble instead. But can you explain why  that didn't work out, and what made you think that you should just move on  from that idea?

Adora Cheung:很明显，这是行不通的，而你却选择了Gobble。但你能解释一下为什么没有成功，是什么让你认为你应该从这个想法出发？

Ooshma Garg: Sure. So back when I was at Stanford, I started this company out of my  dorm room.

Ooshma Garg: 当然。所以当我在斯坦福大学的时候，我在宿舍里开了一家公司。

And fun visual is that I had this 150, 200 square foot room,  with no space and I laughed at my bed, five inches from the ceiling and  stuffed some IKEA desks under my bed. We could only fit three desks in there.  I was a junior. So I hired all these freshmen, really smart freshmen as interns  and got a boyfriend so I could sleep somewhere else for the business, joking.

有趣的是，我有这个150，200平方英尺的房间，没有空间，我嘲笑我的床，离天花板5英寸，把一些宜家的桌子塞在我的床下。我们只能在里面放三张桌子。我当时是个三年级学生。所以我雇佣了所有这些新生，非常聪明的新生作为实习生，并找到了一个男朋友，这样我就可以在别的地方睡觉了，开玩笑的。

And  then our dorm room became our office, and I hid the key in the girls  bathroom and people would come between class and get the key from my pink shower  caddy and then go into my dorm room and work on our startup. So, that  was my first company [inaudible] .

然后我们的寝室变成了我们的办公室，我把钥匙藏在女生浴室里，人们会在上课之间从我的粉红色淋浴房拿钥匙，然后走进我的寝室，在我们的创业公司工作。那是我的第一家公司。

And the idea was to help students get jobs.  I was head of this group Stanford Women in Business. We were matching people to  banks and law firms and consulting firms.

这个想法是为了帮助学生找到工作。我是斯坦福商学院女性研究小组的负责人。我们把人和银行、律师事务所和咨询公司联系起来。

And I worked on that for three years,  I bootstrapped it.

我花了三年的时间来做这个，我自己做的。

And no one would fund me.

没人会资助我。

They told me the idea was  too niche or what have you.But really, no one was using LinkedIn at the time.  And all of these students are looking for work. So I thought that we could  really be the LinkedIn for students.

他们告诉我，这个想法太利基了，或者你有什么想法，但实际上，当时没有人在使用LinkedIn。所有这些学生都在找工作。所以我想我们真的可以成为学生的LinkedIn。

And it was all centered around their interests and  student groups. Long story short, the idea was working and we were making money.

这一切都围绕着他们的兴趣和学生团体。长话短说，这个想法奏效了，我们在赚钱。

These  companies would write us $20,000, $25,000 cheques, for annual subscriptions to my recruiting website, and  it was a two-sided marketplace. So what really happened is, first of all, I poured  everything I had into the business and my health went down the drain which later  leads to Gobble. But what ended up happening is, I learned the hard lesson that  whoever pays you, kind of owns you and determines how your product evolves. So these  banks and consulting firms, and all of them were paying me and they wanted to  recruit students based on quotas, and based on their GPA or their race or other  parts of their background, that didn't really have to do with, if they were a  good cultural match. So anyways, I was making money but the mission and the initial  vision and all of that of the business of helping people find good jobs wasn't  true anymore. So I actually got to a very dark place and ended up selling  the business. So it could have worked, and it could have worked longer term, but  it wasn't the business I initially intended and I'm not the kind of person who,  just going to do something to make money, I want to do something that I  believe in.

这些公司将为我的招聘网站每年订阅20，000美元和25，000美元的支票，这是一个双向的市场。所以，真正发生的是，首先，我把我所有的一切都倾注到了这个行业中，我的健康也随之流失，这就导致了Gobble的出现。但最终发生的是，我学到了一个艰难的教训：谁付钱给你，谁就拥有你，决定你的产品是如何进化的。所以这些银行和咨询公司，他们都付钱给我，他们想根据配额招募学生，根据他们的平均绩点，他们的种族，或者他们的其他背景，如果他们是一个很好的文化匹配的话，这并不是真正意义上的问题。所以无论如何，我是在赚钱，但是我的使命，最初的愿景，以及帮助人们找到好工作的所有事情都不再是真的了。所以我去了一个很黑暗的地方，最后把生意卖了。所以这是可行的，也可以是长期的，但这不是我最初打算做的事情，我不是那种只想做些赚钱的事情，我想做一些我相信的事情的人。

Adora Cheung: Who did you sell it to?

Adora Cheung:你卖给谁了？

Ooshma Garg: So in our third year, we were taking off with law firms.

Ooshma Garg：所以，在我们的第三年，我们开始与律师事务所合作。

There are thousands  of law firms and only 10s of banks on Wall Street.

华尔街有数千家律师事务所，只有10家银行。

And so I sold  it to a company called LawWorks.

所以我把它卖给了一家叫LawWorks的公司。

And basically they're a recruiting company and software, and  they wanted to add community to their offering.

基本上，他们是一家招聘公司和软件公司，他们想在他们的服务中增加社区。

At that time, it was like 2010  and social and communities and all of that were not as common as they are  now.

那时，就像2010年一样，社会和社区以及所有这些都不像现在这样普遍。

Adora Cheung: So you mentioned briefly ...

张：所以你简短地提到.。

This is good transition into maybe talking about Gobble in  the beginning, your health was going down the drain. How did that actually turn into  Gobble itself?

这是一个很好的过渡，也许在一开始，你的健康就会下降。它是如何变成Gobble本身的呢？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah. I'm sure as you all are too familiar with, starting a company at least,  especially in the first thousand days is very, very lonely. Very few people believe in  the idea outside of yourself.

是的。我敢肯定，你们都太熟悉了，至少创办一家公司，尤其是在第一至千天里，是非常孤独的。很少有人相信自己以外的想法。

And most people think you're crazy. Most people don't care  about you.

大多数人都认为你疯了。大多数人都不关心你。

And so you're the only thing that keeps yourself going and maybe your  co-founder, your partner, but your partner is sick of hearing about it, and your co-founder  may or may not work out. So there's lots of loneliness.

所以，你是唯一能让自己保持下去的人，也许是你的联合创始人，你的合伙人，但你的搭档已经厌倦了听到这件事，而你的联合创始人可能会成功，也可能不会成功。所以有很多孤独。

And basically, I became  just very insular, I stopped visiting my family and my friends, I was working on  the business but I was staying up too late and then waking up too late  and then just eating all this takeout and soda and I think it not only  affects your physical health and I gained a lot of weight, but it also affects  your mental health. So all of that came to a head when my dad insisted  on visiting.

基本上，我变得很孤僻，我不再去拜访我的家人和朋友，我在做生意，但我熬夜太晚，然后醒来太晚，然后吃这些外卖和苏打水，我认为它不仅影响你的身体健康，我增加了很多体重，也影响了你的精神健康。所以当我爸爸坚持要去看我的时候，这一切都到了极点。

And I was here in California, my parents are in Texas, and my  dad is the head of nutrition at UT Southwestern in Texas. So he's spent 30  years of his life studying diabetes, obesity and nutrition.

我在加州，我的父母在德克萨斯州，我爸爸是德克萨斯州西南大学的营养主管。所以他花了30年的时间研究糖尿病，肥胖和营养。

And then at home, he would  make sure we all ate home cooked food and real good food.

然后，在家里，他会确保我们都吃家里煮熟的食物和真正的好食物。

And your parents  always know when something's wrong, you can't lie to them. So just a matter of  time. So anyways, he got on a plane ...

你父母总是知道有什么不对劲的时候，你不能对他们撒谎。所以只是时间问题。所以不管怎么说，他上了飞机.

Actually, first he cooked for three  days and made all of this like home-cooked Indian food stuffed it in these international  suitcases that were nicely packed and checked in, everything's on foil and zip blocks and  whatever. Flew here to California to my little dingy studio apartment and without even saying  hello, comes in the apartment, goes to the fridge and starts stuffing the food in  the fridge.

实际上，首先他煮了三天，做了所有这些东西，就像家常便饭一样，把它塞进这些国际行李箱里，里面装得很好，所有的东西都是用锡纸和拉链做成的。飞到加利福尼亚，来到我肮脏的小公寓，甚至连招呼都没说，就进了公寓，走到冰箱前，开始往冰箱里塞食物。

And it just showed his anger and sadness and emotion about me not  taking care of myself and how bad things had gotten and he warmed a little  plate of some sabzi which is a Vegetable Indian dish with some bread and rice  and just put it in front of me, and I had this IKEA two-person dining  table in a corner and I ate this first bite, and I just started crying  uncontrollably because the food was so good.

它只显示了他对我不照顾自己的愤怒、悲伤和情绪，以及事情变得多么糟糕。他把一小盘沙包-一盘面包和米饭配上印度菜-放在我面前，我把这张宜家二人餐桌放在一个角落里，我吃了第一口，我就忍不住哭了，因为食物太好吃了。

And it showed me that that's how much  I had lost.

它告诉我，这就是我失去了多少。

And it wasn't just nutrition. It was like a sense of self  and being, and that's really easy to do.

不仅仅是营养。这就像一种自我和存在的感觉，这真的很容易做到。

And so anyways, that first bite of  my dad's home cooking, inspired Gobble.

所以不管怎么说，我爸爸的第一口菜激发了Gobble的灵感。

And that moment was when I decided that home  cooking and the sense of family dinner is very important to me.

就在那一刻，我决定在家做饭和家庭晚餐的感觉对我来说是非常重要的。

Adora Cheung: So the first version on Gobble, if I got it correctly, it was a marketplace  for people to create home cooked meals and sell it on the marketplace. So that  was 2011.

张阿多拉：所以第一个版本的Gobble，如果我正确的，它是一个市场，为人们创造家庭熟食，并在市场上出售。那是2011年。

And then I believe, one year later you turned it into if I  have this written down, catering.

然后我相信，一年后，你把它变成了，如果我写下来，饮食。

Ooshma Garg: Yes.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。

Adora Cheung: And then year later, it was personalized dinner service and then to pretty much what  is today, 10, 15 dinner kits. So maybe you could start off with if you  remember, your one liner for each four of those business models to help us distinguish  the difference between these four.

Adora Cheung:然后一年后，它是个性化的晚餐服务，然后到今天差不多是什么，10，15套晚餐包。所以，如果你还记得的话，也许你可以从你的四种商业模式中的一条线开始，以帮助我们区分这四种模式之间的区别。

Ooshma Garg: Absolutely. I definitely remember the first one because it's what I raised our seed round  off of. So we started after I ate that food. I wanted to replicate my  dad in the Bay Area.

Ooshma Garg: 当然。我肯定记得第一次，因为这是我把我们的种子培育出来的原因。所以我吃完食物后我们就开始了。我想在湾区复制我爸爸。

And I posted on Craigslist and looked for moms or  dads that would cook for me.

我在Craigslist上发帖，寻找能为我做饭的妈妈或爸爸。

Anyway, the way that we described the idea ultimately  became a marketplace for personal chefs and, and families and we described it as peer  to peer lasagna.

不管怎样，我们描述这个想法的方式最终变成了一个私人厨师和家庭的市场，我们把它描述为点对点的千层面。

And everyone remembered that, and just said it and it was catchy  and weird and the peer to peer economy was really hot at the time.

每个人都记得这一点，只是说了这句话，它很吸引人，很奇怪，当时的对等经济非常火爆。

Airbnb  was just coming up, Etsy was coming up and there were all these rental or  sharing startups in 2010 to 2012. So that's what we described the marketplace. Catering was  just like home cooked food for office.

Airbnb刚刚推出，Etsy即将上市，2010到2012年间，所有这些租赁或共享初创企业都出现了。这就是我们对市场的描述。餐饮业就像办公室里的家常便饭。

The personalized dinner service was exactly that, it  was meals personalized exactly to your tastes.

个性化的晚餐服务就是这样的，这是完全符合你口味的饭菜。

And our current dinner kits we describe just  as a meal prep service, 15 minute one pan cooking.

和我们目前的晚餐包，我们只描述为一顿饭准备服务，15分钟一锅烹饪。

Adora Cheung: So everyone who built the product always remembers their very first user, who wasn't their  mom or dad or family. Do you remember that person? And what was he or  she like?

Adora Cheung:所以每个生产这个产品的人都记得他们的第一个用户，他不是他们的父母或家人。你还记得那个人吗？他或她是什么样的人？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah. So recently I met one of our very first 10 users.

是的。所以最近我遇到了我们最初的10个用户之一。

The guy's name  is Sheel Tyle, and it's really funny. I actually met him and he was a  user of ours in 2011. So now it's some seven, eight years later. I met  him a few weeks ago at a wedding in New York.

这家伙的名字叫谢尔·泰尔，这真的很有趣。实际上我见过他，他在2011年也是我们的用户。现在已经是七八年后了。几周前我在纽约的一个婚礼上认识他。

And he was, "Are  you Ooshma?" I was like, "Yeah." He was, "I used to eat your food." Your  product goes through so many iterations that when someone remembers, the first website of yours,  and all that, those bugs and things, it's really special. He was a Stanford student,  and he would email us pages of feedback, every time he tried the food.

他说：“你是乌希玛吗？”我说“是啊”他说，“我以前吃过你的食物。”你的产品经历了如此多的反复，以至于当有人记得，你的第一个网站，以及所有的那些错误和东西，它真的很特别。他是斯坦福大学的学生，每次尝试食物时，他都会给我们发电子邮件反馈信息。

And  so it was kind of the canonical early adopter that someone who really wants to  work with you and who wants to help improve your company and make it good  for them and for everybody else.

因此，这是一个典型的早期采用者，一个真正想和你一起工作的人，他想帮助你改善公司，使之对他们和其他人都有好处。

Adora Cheung: So in the beginning you also did a lot of unscalable things to get users.  I read you did promo cards everywhere, you went to Starbucks, and I guess bother  people to order from Gobble. So all of those things probably didn't work. But anything  that you remember that actually worked?

张：所以在开始的时候，你也做了很多不可伸缩的事情来吸引用户。我读到你到处都在做宣传卡，你去了星巴克，我想是麻烦人们从Gobble订购。所以这些东西可能都没用。但你记得的东西真的起作用了吗？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah.

是的。

There are two things that worked, and I was reflecting on this. One of  them is ... I guess the things that work is when you're just starting out,  you can't throw $1,000,000 into Facebook ads in one week. But it doesn't also work  to just like talk to 10 individuals, that's to unscalable. So it's all about reaching  like micro groups. One thing I did is I went to all my favorite shops  like coffee shops, restaurants laundromats, whatever and I actually bought card holders on, whatever, equipment  website and made promo cards that were business card size and it said like to  free dinners Gobble.com and it had the restaurants name on the back. One of the  first valuable innovations or features that we released into our product was the ability to  accept promo codes, because attribution of your growth is extremely important from day one or  else I can't tell you what's working or not working. So there's ZombieRunners on California  Avenue, it's this coffee shop.

有两件事起作用了，我在想这件事。其中之一是.。我想，当你刚开始工作的时候，你不可能在一周内向Facebook的广告投入100万美元。但是它也不能像和10个人交谈那样有效，那就是不能扩展。所以这一切都是关于像微群体一样的接触。我做的一件事是，我去了我最喜欢的商店，比如咖啡店，餐馆，洗衣店，什么的，我买了卡持卡人，不管是什么，设备网站，制作了名片大小的宣传卡，上面写着Gobble.com免费晚餐，背面还有餐馆的名字。我们在产品中发布的第一批有价值的创新或特性之一是接受广告代码的能力，因为从第一天起，你成长的原因是非常重要的-我无法告诉你什么在起作用，什么不起作用。加州大道上有僵尸跑步者，就是这家咖啡店。

And it's inside a running store that used to be  a movie theater. It's very weird. You should go there. It's my favorite coffee shop.  And so they put a little thing at their register.

它就在一家曾经是电影院的跑步商店里。很奇怪。你应该去那里。这是我最喜欢的咖啡店。所以他们在他们的登记簿上放了个小东西。

And it turned out to  be more effective than the nail salons, the laundromats anything else another YC company order  ahead actually for a while was very successful with coffee shops and promos and ordering  at coffee shops. One other thing was I spoke to as many meetup groups or  moms groups and neighborhood groups as possible and I would get them, I would always  try to have an offer that was ... I tested offers and I knew what  would work, so every single one of them would send my offer on their email  list and it had to be an email with your offer to a group and  that converted.

事实证明，这比美甲沙龙更有效，洗衣店还能为其他的YC公司定购其他任何东西-事实上，有一段时间，它在咖啡店、广告和咖啡店的点菜方面非常成功。另一件事是，我和尽可能多的会议团体或母亲团体和邻里团体交谈，我会得到他们，我总是试图得到一个提议是.我测试了报价，我知道什么是有效的，所以他们每个人都会把我的提议发到他们的电子邮件列表上，它必须是一封电子邮件，你的提议会发送给一个团体，然后被转换。

Adora Cheung: The attribution point is very I think key there, which is even if you're doing  a spray and pray method of just everyone, use me at least you know when  they come in the door or they actually-

Adora Cheung:我认为关键在于，即使你在为每个人做喷雾和祈祷的方法，至少你知道当他们进门的时候，或者实际上

Ooshma Garg: Absolutely, yes.

Ooshma Garg: 当然，是的。

Adora Cheung: Cool. So, again going back to the evolution of the business, at what point in  each of the business models did you realize, "Oh, this isn't it, I got to  think of something else?"

Adora Cheung:酷。所以，再回到企业的发展过程，在每一种商业模式中，你在什么时候意识到，“哦，不是这样的，我还得想点别的东西呢？”

Ooshma Garg: Right.

Ooshma Garg: 对。

The funny thing is that and so first of all, we talked about these  business models, all of that was going on from 2011 to 2014. So between three  and a half years, which is still roughly that 1,000 days of finding product market  fit, we had four different iterations to the product.

有趣的是，首先，我们讨论了这些商业模式，所有这些都发生在2011年到2014年。所以在三年半的时间里，也就是大约1000天的时间里，我们对产品进行了四次不同的迭代。

And this is a minor little  point but I know that, I think Michael Seibel spoke recently and he talked about  the difference between pivoting and iterating, and I thought that was really important. Because people  say Gobble pivoted, but we didn't pivot. We didn't turn into some online video game.  We just iterated and then found success. So I think that nuance is important because  pivoting, I think you don't carry a lot of your learnings with you, iterating is  always building on your previous learnings. So with these business models, and different iterations and  launches, they all failed for different reasons. We had a marketplace first and everyone loved  the food because it was this authentic small batch home-cooked food from real people, Italian  grandmas, and Mexican moms, and Ethiopian chefs and things, and food you can't get anywhere  else, that's not ruined by capitalism, I guess.

这是一个小小的小问题，但我知道，我认为迈克尔·塞贝尔(MichaelSeibel)最近发表了演讲，他谈到了旋转和迭代之间的区别，我认为这是非常重要的。因为人们说Gobble旋转，但我们没有枢轴。我们没有变成网络游戏。我们只是重复了一遍，然后找到了成功。所以我认为这种细微差别是很重要的，因为我认为你不会随身携带大量的知识，迭代总是建立在你以前所学到的基础上的。因此，由于这些业务模型，以及不同的迭代和启动，它们都因不同的原因而失败。我们首先有了一个市场，每个人都很喜欢这里的食物，因为这是一批地道的小批量家常菜-来自真人、意大利祖母、墨西哥妈妈、埃塞俄比亚厨师和诸如此类的东西，你在其他任何地方都买不到的食物，我想这不会被资本主义破坏。

Anyways, that food wasn't scalable. So, we  started getting success with that marketplace idea but when I asked this Italian mom in  San Carlos to make me 200 of her lasagna when she used to make 20  a day, it wasn't fun anymore and she didn't want to make 200 and she  wasn't a caterer. So that model ...

不管怎么说，那些食物是无法扩展的。所以，我们开始在市场想法上取得成功，但当我让圣卡洛斯的一位意大利妈妈给我做200块意大利千层面时，她曾经每天做20块，这已经不好玩了，她不想做200块，也不是一家宴会的承办商。所以那个模型.。

Airbnb is a peer-to-peer model that can scale  and it's sharing an asset, it's sharing a space.

Airbnb是一种点对点模式，它可以扩展，共享资产，共享空间。

This is a peer-to-peer model that  has a lot of break points at scale of quality, time, capacity, and so on.  So that's why the marketplace model didn't work. We were supply-constrained not by the number  of chefs, but by the juice, we could squeeze from each of our skews on  the marketplace.

这是一个点对点模型，在质量、时间、容量等方面有很多断点。这就是为什么市场模型不起作用的原因。我们的供应不是受到厨师数量的限制，而是受到果汁的限制，我们可以从市场上的每一根鱼叉中挤出来。

Then we pivoted to the catering because we had built that marketplace with  seed funding.

然后我们转向餐饮业，因为我们用种子资金建造了那个市场。

And we maybe had like a half a year of money left or  something. But one of our investors was very insistent that we pad our growth with  money, and we do something that will definitely make us money.

我们可能还剩半年的钱什么的。但是我们的一位投资者非常坚持我们要用钱来缓冲我们的增长，我们做一些肯定会让我们赚钱的事情。

And so I went  into the catering world. Frankly, to me, I think it's very easy.

所以我进入了餐饮业。坦白说，对我来说，这很容易。

And I didn't  really want to do it, we got like box [inaudible] and Pinterest.

我真的不想这么做，我们就像盒子(听不见的)和Pinterest一样。

And these companies  signed on, and they rarely quit.

这些公司签了名，很少辞职。

And so you're just making this money in the  background. We did that, we made good money, and we showed growth. But the problem  is that when we went to raise Series A, the investors asked how much of  your money is from families, and the model you're pitching? And how much of your  money is from catering and from enterprise? And at that point, some 75% was from  enterprise. Because when you do something like that, the previous startup lesson we learned, all  your attention goes to what's giving you the most money.

所以你只是在后台赚钱。我们做到了这一点，我们赚了很多钱，而且我们表现出了增长。但问题是，当我们去筹集A系列的时候，投资者问你有多少钱来自家庭，而你所推销的模式呢？你的钱有多少来自餐饮和企业？在这一点上，大约75%来自企业。因为当你这样做的时候，就像我们以前学到的创业经验一样，你的注意力都集中在给你钱最多的东西上了。

And so that really sucked,  because unless I wanted to build a catering business, then I wasn't going to get  funding. So we were in a pinch then, and I had to raise a bridge  round and wind down the catering business, which was hugely unpopular, because we were making  lots of money. But it wasn't my long-term vision.

所以这真的很糟糕，因为除非我想建立一家餐饮业，否则我就得不到资金。所以当时我们处于紧要关头，我不得不架起一座桥，结束餐饮业务，这是非常不受欢迎的，因为我们赚了很多钱。但这不是我的长远愿景。

The vision was that people don't  have access to this home-cooked food.

他们的愿景是，人们无法获得这种自制的食物。

And I wanted to crack it and figure it  out and give it to everyone. So we wound that down because it wasn't part  of a long-term vision. So then we focused on this personalized dinner service. I still  today think that the power of personalization, what Amazon brings to e-commerce and what Netflix  and Spotify bring to movies and music, that level of personalization has not taken off  in food.

我想破解它，想办法把它给每个人。所以我们结束了它，因为它不是长期愿景的一部分。所以我们专注于个性化的晚餐服务。我今天仍然认为，个性化的力量，亚马逊给电子商务带来的，以及Netflix和Spotify带给电影和音乐的东西，这种个性化的程度并没有在食物中得到提升。

And just like Google with search, the company that cracks that in food,  I think will be like the long-term winner, and have all these learnings built on  top of each other to where you build a long-term sustainable advantage. So that's what  we did with that personalized dinner service. We took these chefs and and then we  started using restaurants and caterers and we focused on the technology, because that that's the  talent that we had in our headquarters. We had engineers and product people. So we  focused on the tech to match, to take ... We allowed people to give us  whatever tastes they wanted. So we ended up getting thousands of picky eaters and people  who didn't eat night shades.

就像谷歌和搜索一样，这个在食品领域有所突破的公司，我认为这将是一个长期的赢家，所有这些知识都建立在彼此的基础上，从而建立起长期的可持续优势。这就是我们对个性化晚餐服务所做的。我们接受了这些厨师，然后我们开始使用餐馆和餐饮业，我们专注于这项技术，因为这就是我们在总部所拥有的才能。我们有工程师和产品人员。所以我们把注意力集中在技术上来匹配.我们允许人们给我们他们想要的任何口味。所以我们最终得到了成千上万挑剔的食客和不吃夜光的人。

And they were vegan, but they still didn't like olives  and lettuce, and like crazy stuff.

他们是素食主义者，但他们仍然不喜欢橄榄和生菜，也不喜欢疯狂的东西。

And no matter what your tastes were, I said  I would feed you.

不管你的口味如何，我说过我会喂你的。

And so anyway, that model really stretched our technology, and by  doing the hard thing we learned.

不管怎么说，这个模型确实扩展了我们的技术，通过做我们学到的困难的事情。

Adora Cheung: If you're vegan, and don't like lettuce, what are you eating?

张：如果你是素食主义者，不喜欢生菜，你吃什么？

Ooshma Garg: I know, I don't know, like lots of beans.

我知道，我不知道，就像很多豆子一样。

Adora Cheung: So you move the business model a little bit each time or quite a bit,  actually, each time.

Adora Cheung:所以你每次都会移动一些商业模式，实际上，每一次都会有很大的变动。

Ooshma Garg: Yes.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。

Adora Cheung: And so one of the difficult things in doing that is taking the risk and  bringing down your current business for hopefully future success.

Adora Cheung:因此，在这样做的困难之一是冒险，并降低你目前的业务，希望未来的成功。

And that, I think a lot  of people actually don't do that. Because it's very, very scary.

而且，我认为很多人实际上不这么做。因为它非常可怕。

They just try keep  pushing the current model, trying to make it work. So was it scary for you?  And what was your thought process and actually just saying, "No, not going to do  the enterprise catering anymore, even though it's making tons of money."

他们只是试着继续推动目前的模式，试图让它发挥作用。你害怕吗？你的思考过程是什么，你只是说，“不，不再做餐饮企业了，尽管它赚了很多钱。”

Ooshma Garg: Right. It was, it was so scary.

Ooshma Garg: 对。太可怕了。

And it was really scary.

真的很可怕。

And actually, some  of our investors would call me into their office and just use it as, me  as a punching bag, sit down at their reclaimed wood table and their kitchen or  something, and, and I'd be sitting in a stand top, and they'd be ...

实际上，我们的一些投资者会把我叫到他们的办公室，把我当作一个沙袋，坐在他们回收的木头桌子和厨房什么的旁边，然后，我就坐在一个顶上，他们就会.。

And  every time there's new startups coming up, the grass is always greener, because the investors  know all your problems, and they don't know any of the other problems. So anyway,  so they'll be, "This company, Montroy is starting, and this company OrderAhead is starting, and  all these companies are starting and what are you doing?" And it was much louder  and much worse than that.

每次有新的创业公司出现，草皮总是更绿，因为投资者知道你所有的问题，他们不知道任何其他的问题。所以不管怎么说，他们会是，“这个公司，Montroy开始了，这个公司OrderAhead开始了，所有这些公司都开始了，你在做什么？”比这更响亮更糟糕。

And so, but I have found, I think that's what  you mentioned earlier about the grit and determination, I don't know if it's learned or  what it is. Over so many years, I have found that I cannot listen to  anything.

所以，但是我发现，我想这就是你前面提到的关于勇气和决心的东西，我不知道它是学到的还是学到的。这么多年来，我发现我什么都听不进去。

There's nothing more loud than my gut.

没有比我的直觉更响亮的了。

And when you know something, and you've  been in it for three years, or thousands of days, you can't avoid it. You  know what you have to do, other people think about you like 1% of the  year, and just in the one hour meeting.

当你知道一些事情，你已经在里面呆了三年，或者几千天，你无法避免它。你知道你要做什么，其他人对你的看法就像一年中的1%，就在一个小时的会议上。

And so I think early on, we  put a lot of weight into investor meetings, even into YC partner meetings, into all  these meetings, and it can really throw you off your game for a few days,  you're, "Oh, this one person didn't like my idea, who am I?" And it's just  something you have to get through.

所以我想，我们很早就把很多精力放在投资者会议，甚至YC合作伙伴会议上，在所有这些会议上，这真的会让你在几天内退出你的游戏，你会说，“哦，这个人不喜欢我的主意，我是谁？”这只是你必须要通过的东西。

And I would always try to justify each direction  with logic and with market drawings. One book that really helped me was Blue Ocean  Strategy. It's my favorite business book to date.

我总是试图用逻辑和市场图来证明每一个方向是正确的。一本真正帮助我的书是“蓝海战略”。这是我迄今为止最喜欢的商业书籍。

And it talks about how companies broke  through the noise and existing industries, talks about Southwest Airlines, Yellow Tail Wine, and some  really interesting companies, and that no one thought would work.

它谈到了公司如何突破噪音和现有的行业，谈论西南航空公司，黄酒公司，以及一些真正有趣的公司，没有人认为会起作用。

And it gives you a  framework with which to think about your company.

它为你提供了一个思考公司的框架。

And I would draw that framework and  keep using it as my North Star.

我会画出这个框架，然后继续用它作为我的北极星。

Adora Cheung: In a previous talk, and let me read this, so I get it right, you  said something really insightful, which is product market fit is not just an aha moment,  it's a summation of lots of broad experiments and micro-learnings over many years. Can you  briefly expand on that? A common mistake is for people when they look at product  market fit, is to just look at one metric.

张：在之前的演讲中，让我读一下，你说得很有洞察力，这就是产品市场的适合不仅仅是一个时刻，它是多年来许多广泛的实验和微观经验的总结。你能简单地详述一下吗？一个常见的错误是人们在看产品市场时，只看一个指标。

And then if it moves in  one direction then that's good. So what did you look at the beginning? And how  did you visualize this summation of stuff?

如果它朝一个方向移动，那就好了。你刚开始看什么？你是如何想象这些东西的总和的？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah. Ultimately, I think that product market fit is the center of the Venn diagram  of ability to grow on one side, and retention on the other side.

是的。最终，我认为产品市场的契合是维恩图的中心，一方面是增长的能力，另一方面是保持的能力。

And so  if you look at our history, in the marketplace model, we weren't able to grow  because of the chefs. We were supply constrained in the personalized dinner model. We actually  weren't able to grow really fast, because of the customers. Even though it was personalized,  the food wasn't better than the best takeout that you could order. So if you  want to change the world, or change your industry, you have to do something that  is materially better, iPhone level better than the market. So people weren't racing to our  doors. So we didn't have that ability to grow. Our dinner kit model has the  ability to grow and scale internally and externally from customer demand.

因此，如果你看看我们的历史，市场模式，我们无法增长，因为厨师。在个性化的晚餐模式中，我们的供应受到了限制。事实上，由于客户的原因，我们的发展速度不太快。尽管它是个性化的，但食物并不比你能点的最好的外卖更好。因此，如果你想改变世界，或者改变你的行业，你必须做一些物质上更好的事情，比市场更好的iPhone水平。所以人们没有跑到我们的门口。所以我们没有成长的能力。我们的餐盒模型有能力根据客户的需求在内部和外部进行扩展和扩展。

And it also has  high retention.

此外，它还具有较高的保留度。

Adora Cheung: So moving on to maybe more about grit and determination. So in the beginning at  Stanford, you are a Bioengineering Major?

Adora Cheung:所以，继续讲的也许更多的是关于勇气和决心。所以在斯坦福大学刚开始，你是生物工程专业的学生？

Ooshma Garg: Yes.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。

Adora Cheung: Technical, but not a coder. How did you manage actually doing all of this without  being technical?

张：技术，但不是编码器。实际上，你是如何做到这一切的，而不是技术性的呢？

Ooshma Garg: Yes. Well, initially, and everyone is going to use their skill sets.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。一开始，每个人都会使用他们的技能。

And I think  the one common theme is that in the first few months, you need to prove  your concept, you need to have an MVP, you can do that with code, you  can do that with sales, whatever. So I did not know how to code. I  learned PHP, but in both my businesses, in the recruiting business, and the chef business  or the food business I have now, I made initial sales without a website.

我认为一个共同的主题是，在最初的几个月里，你需要证明你的概念，你需要一个MVP，你可以用代码来做，你可以用销售来做。所以我不知道怎么编码。我学了PHP，但在我的公司，在招聘业务，以及厨师业务或食品业务，我做了初步的销售没有网站。

And  I proved our concept in the first three months before any other funding. So with  the recruiting business, I did know, like Photoshop and design, and I taught myself all  of that and loved it. So I enjoyed that.

在其他资金投入之前的头三个月，我证明了我们的概念。因此，在招聘业务中，我确实知道，比如Photoshop和设计，我自学了所有这些，并且很喜欢它。所以我很享受。

And I designed these sales packages  that would ...

我设计了这些销售套餐.

And I made up stuff, I was like, gold, platinum, whatever, $20,000,  I would like to see if people would give it to me, which is very  bold as a college student.

我做了些东西，我就像，黄金，白金，不管是什么，2万美元，我想看看人们是否愿意把它给我，作为一个大学生，这是非常大胆的。

And I had a mock-up of a website that wasn't  built yet.

我还做了一个还没建好的网站的模拟。

And I took a semester off and only did sales, because that was  my proof of concept.

我休了一个学期的假，只做销售，因为这是我的概念证明。

And my parents said that only if I got a sale,  could I not go work on Wall Street, which was horrible. So side note, I  didn't get a sale that semester.

我的父母说，只有我得到一笔买卖，我才能不去华尔街工作，这太可怕了。所以顺便说一句，那学期我没有买到任何东西。

And I made I met maybe 80 or so  people through introductions.

我通过自我介绍认识了大约80个人。

And I went to go work at Morgan Stanley in 2008, in  that horrible summer, and I hated my life. It was like equities trading.

2008年，在那个可怕的夏天，我去摩根士丹利工作，我痛恨自己的生活。就像股票交易。

And three  weeks in, I got a cheque in the mail for $10,000, because it was a  founding customer price from this law firm.

三周后，我收到一张10，000美元的支票，因为这是这家律师事务所的创始客户价格。

And it was like the coolest day of  my life. It was revenue, it was validation.

就像我生命中最酷的一天。这是收入，是验证。

And it took me seven to 10  days to figure out how to quit the internship. People were all, "You'll get blacklisted,  you'll never get a job." And I told the head of the program, and he  said, "You will always have a job here, but you will never come back." And  I thought that that was weird at the time, and now I fully understand it.  And it's because, once an entrepreneur always an entrepreneur in your heart, in a way.  So anyways, I think the quitting is hard. It's a long story short, but it's  hard to avoid.

我花了七到十天的时间想出了如何辞去实习的方法。人们都说，“你会被列入黑名单，你永远找不到工作。”我告诉项目负责人，他说：“你永远在这里有工作，但你永远不会回来。”当时我觉得很奇怪，现在我完全明白了。这是因为，一旦一个企业家在你的心中永远是一个企业家，在某种程度上。所以不管怎么说，我觉得辞职很难。这是一个长话短说，但这是很难避免的。

Adora Cheung: So around 2011, 2014, you had a hard time raising money. Correct? So, I mean,  it's three years, how did you fund all of this? And then also, at the  same time, what did you spend your days doing? It must have been really when  you can't get money, that's a huge distraction. So how did you focus on your  business and keep going?

Adora Cheung:所以在2011年，2014年，你很难筹到钱。对，是这样所以，我是说，已经三年了，你是怎么资助这些的？同时，你每天都在做些什么呢？那一定是当你拿不到钱的时候，这是一个巨大的干扰。那么，你是如何专注于自己的业务并继续下去的呢？

Ooshma Garg: Yes, so first of all, over those three and a half years of finding product  market fit, our monthly burn was $40,000, on average, that's pretty low.

Ooshma Garg：是的，所以首先，在这三年半的产品市场上，我们的月平均烧价是40，000美元，这是相当低的。

That's not a  fancy office, that's not 10 people, we kept it to about four people.

那不是一间豪华的办公室，也不是10个人，我们把它留给了大约四个人。

And everyone  had to be like, co-founder style generalist, because we were still iterating. So if you  make your burn 40 K, you can make your 1.5 million last a while. But  we raised two bridge rounds during that time.

每个人都必须像，共同创始人风格的多面手，因为我们仍然在迭代。因此，如果你把你的烧伤40K，你可以使你的150万持续一段时间。但在这段时间里我们开了两圈桥。

And there were some investors who refused  to invest, some of them who saw, would listen to the next iteration, and invest  in me, both of those bridges were like 200, some K.

有些投资者拒绝投资，有些人看到了，他们会听下一次迭代，然后投资在我身上，这两座桥都是200，有些K。

And one critical thing,  there was a time in 2013, when no one would invest in me, and I  was running out of all of my money.

还有一件关键的事情，那就是在2013年，没有人会投资我，而我的钱都花光了。

And we had one payroll in the  bank. I think our bank was $8,000 or something.

银行里只有一份工资。我想我们的银行是8，000美元左右。

And that's when I did YC.  So, I didn't do YC, at the beginning of Gobble, I did YC, three and  a half years into the struggle. I didn't know I was about to figure it  out. Everybody had lost faith.

那就是我做YC的时候。所以，我没有做YC，在Gobble开始的时候，我做了YC，奋斗了三年半。我不知道我会想出来的。每个人都失去了信心。

And I'm the only one who had faith.

我是唯一一个有信心的人。

And the  only money I could get was from Jessica, and PG.

我唯一能得到的钱就是杰西卡和皮格。

And so I did YC  and they said, they would help me raise a Series A, they would fund me  for three more months.

所以我做了YC，他们说，他们会帮我筹集一个A系列，他们会再给我三个月的资金。

And six months after that, we figured out our 15 minute  one pan dinner kit.

六个月后，我们找到了我们的15分钟一盘套餐。

Adora Cheung: So you mentioned you had employees during this hard time. How did you keep them  motivated to keep going?

Adora Cheung:所以你提到在这段艰难的时期你有员工。你是如何激励他们继续前进的？

Ooshma Garg: That's a tough one. I think that there's a lot of turnover in the early  days.

Ooshma Garg：这是一个艰难的问题。我认为早期有大量的营业额。

And even in the later days.

甚至在以后的日子里。

After venture financing, and you're learning how to  hire execs. But the employees that ended up lasting the longest were by referral.

在风险融资之后，你正在学习如何雇佣高管。但最终持续时间最长的员工都是通过转诊。

And  so there were some shared values and shared trust there.

因此，这里有一些共同的价值观和共同的信任。

And I also really clued  them into the hard times. Sometimes you think you're protecting people by not telling them  but actually your closest employees, especially when you're four to six, if you bring them  into the challenge, and if they are challenge-oriented, they will stay with you. But if  you hide it, then they're not really feeling that excitement, and that challenge.

我也真的让他们陷入了困境。有时候你认为你是在保护人们，因为你没有告诉他们，但实际上是你最亲密的员工，尤其是当你四到六岁的时候，如果你把他们带到了挑战中，如果他们是面向挑战的，他们就会和你在一起。但如果你把它藏起来，他们就不会真正感觉到那种兴奋和挑战。

Adora Cheung: At one point you said that you got an acquisition offer, or one of your  investors wanted you to just get acquired by a clothing startup-

张：有一次你说你收到了收购要约，或者你的一个投资者想让你被一家服装初创公司收购-

Ooshma Garg: A clothing startup, yes.

Ooshma Garg：是的，一家服装初创公司。

Adora Cheung: Completely different. I mean, you're having a hard time and here's potentially money in your  bank account. What was your thought process in just turning that down?

Adora Cheung:完全不同。我是说，你现在很难过，你的银行账户里可能有钱。你的思维过程是怎么拒绝的？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah. I've thought a lot about this. Right now, even in our space, there's a  lot of consolidation in the food space, and the meal kits space if you like.  See the news, it's very popular drama in the news. I mean, there's all these  companies like Facebook, or Snapchat, or this or that, that have turned down different offers  over time.

是的。这件事我想了很多。现在，即使在我们的空间里，食物空间也有很多整合，如果你愿意的话，食物包空间。看新闻，这是新闻中很受欢迎的戏剧。我的意思是，像Facebook、Snapchat或者这个或那个这样的公司，随着时间的推移，拒绝了不同的报价。

And sometimes it's right, some it's wrong, judged by society. I just see  so much potential in Gobble.

有时候是对的，有些是错的，这是由社会判断的。我看到Gobble有这么大的潜力。

And once we ... Early on, I turned that clothing  startup thing down in that product market fit time, because this is what I want  to work on, and I have nothing to lose, I didn't have kids or whatever.  And I just didn't imagine a better life than working on a hard problem.

一旦我们.。早些时候，我拒绝了服装初创公司在那个产品市场合适的时间，因为这是我想要做的，我没有什么可失去的，我没有孩子什么的。我只是没有想到比解决一个棘手的问题更好的生活。

And  now we've started doubling or tripling year on year.

现在，我们已经开始每年增加一倍或三倍。

And so if someone were to  acquire us now, and we can't weather the storm of a bad meal kit market,  I think we're like leaving billions on the table.

因此，如果现在有人要收购我们，而我们又不能经受坏饭盒市场的风暴，我想我们就像把数十亿美元放在桌面上一样。

Adora Cheung: Speaking of competition, there has been billions of dollars in venture funding going into competitors,  or so called competitors, like [inaudible] and so forth. I mean, you were the original  meal kit company, what do you think about? Is it like all that money is  going over there, but you're, "I'm here, surviving and I'm growing fast." What's really going  in your mind?

Adora Cheung:说到竞争，已经有数十亿美元的风险投资流向竞争对手，或者所谓的竞争对手，比如(听不见的)等等。我是说，你是最初的饭盒公司，你觉得呢？是不是所有的钱都花在那里了，但你却在说，“我在这里，我活下来了，我成长得很快。”你脑子里到底在想什么？

Ooshma Garg: Yeah, well, we can look at the silver lining of it, which is that necessity  breeds invention.

Ooshma Garg：是啊，好吧，我们可以看看它的一线希望，那就是需要孕育发明。

And so by not having that much money, we didn't get comfortable.

所以没有那么多钱，我们就不舒服了。

And  we had to innovate.

我们必须创新。

And we had to have good numbers. So I'm not saying  that we should all starve our companies. But because we were somewhat cost-starved, I wasn't  distracted by lots of fancy things.

我们必须有好的数字。所以我不是说我们都应该饿死我们的公司。但因为我们有点成本不足，我没有被许多花哨的东西分散注意力。

And I just focused on making all the dollars  count and doing something meaningful.

我只想让所有的钱都有价值，做一些有意义的事情。

Adora Cheung: So you talk a lot about mission. But beyond that, what actually really ... How  did you keep going over the seven, eight years? Is it genetic? What do you  think it really is beyond just the mission?

Adora Cheung:所以你说了很多关于任务的事情。但除此之外，真正的.你是怎么度过这七、八年的？是遗传的吗？你觉得这到底是什么超出了任务的范围？

Ooshma Garg: Wow. Man, maybe it is some nature nurture thing. Mission is a big part of  it. But with regards to the grit and determination thing, from an early age, I  think I just ... My parents wanted me to go to the school, this all  girls school, and I hated my current school, I was bullied a lot.

Ooshma Garg: 哇。伙计，也许这是后天培养的东西。任务是其中很重要的一部分。但关于勇气和决心的问题，从很小的时候，我就觉得.我的父母想让我去学校，这都是女子学校，而我讨厌我现在的学校，我经常被欺负。

And there  was bad phrases and racist things on my locker and bad stuff.

我的柜子里有不好的词组和种族歧视的东西，还有一些不好的东西。

And I applied  to this girl school in kindergarten, and I didn't get in.

我在幼儿园申请了一所女子学校，但我没进。

And then in first  grade, and I didn't get in, and in second grade, and I didn't get in,  and you had to take this ERB test.

然后在一年级，我没有进入，在二年级，我没有进入，你必须参加这个再培训局的测试。

And then in those early grades are  asking what's a triangle or something, right? And I didn't get in. So I was,  "What's going on?" And my parents weren't donating, and there's all these other factors. But  I didn't know that.

在早期的年级里，你会问什么是三角形什么的，对吧？但我没进去。所以我说，“怎么回事？”我的父母没有捐赠，还有其他的因素。但我不知道。

And so I kept applying, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade  didn't get in.

所以我继续申请，三年级，四年级，五年级没有进入。

And I remember one time my parents were, "The test is coming  up, this is for your future, you need to do this." And I was just  so mad. I just remember being so defeated and so distraught, and I was letting  them down, and I didn't want to take the test. I was, "Who needs this  school? Forget it, it's stupid." And I took the test, and I still didn't get  in.

我记得有一次我的父母说：“考试就要到了，这是为了你的未来，你需要这样做。”我只是太生气了。我只记得被打败了，心烦意乱，我让他们失望了，我不想参加考试。我说：“谁需要这所学校？算了吧，这太蠢了。”我做了测试，但还是没进。

And finally, in seventh grade, I got into that school.

最后，在七年级的时候，我进了那所学校。

And it changed my  life. I used every resource they had, I started new organizations, I got funding from  the principal of the school to start a Model UN society. I saw it in  a different way.

它改变了我的生活。我利用了他们所有的资源，我成立了新的组织，我得到了学校校长的资助，建立了一个模拟联合国社会。我以不同的方式看待它。

And I just seized the entire opportunity when I was there, because  I knew how special it was, and I worked so hard to get there.

当我在那里的时候，我抓住了所有的机会，因为我知道它是多么的特别，我为了达到这个目标而努力工作。

And  so somehow, early on, that was one experience. But there were experiences like that, that  I just learned that life is about hard work.

所以，在某种程度上，早期，这是一种体验。但也有过这样的经历，我才知道生活就是艰苦的工作。

And it's about lead bullets.

是关于铅子弹的。

And  I'm always enamored by these real overnight successes. I think the most overnight successes are  10 years in the making.

我总是被这些一蹴而就的成功所吸引。我认为一夜之间最成功的是10年。

There are some flukes that are one year, two year,  three years that the media celebrates in a disproportionate amount.

有一些侥幸，是一年，两年，三年，媒体庆祝的不成比例的数量。

And I'm always very enamored  by them. But the only way that I know is this lead bullets, grit do  not give up strategy.

我一直很喜欢他们。但我所知道的唯一方法是这种先导子弹，坚韧不放弃战略。

Adora Cheung: You were a very ambitious third grader, and a [inaudible] too.

Adora Cheung:你是一个非常雄心勃勃的三年级学生，也是一个(听不见的)。

Ooshma Garg: Thank you.

Ooshma Garg：谢谢。

Adora Cheung: I wish that we had known you then. We would have just predicted all this,  and funded you all the way back in kindergarten.

Adora Cheung:我希望我们那时认识你。我们早就预料到了这一切，在幼儿园的时候资助了你。

Ooshma Garg: That would have been great.

Ooshma Garg: 那就太好了。

Adora Cheung: So you talked about, obviously never quitting, but do you think there are reasons to  quit?

Adora Cheung:所以你说过，很明显从来没有放弃过，但是你认为有理由辞职吗？

Ooshma Garg: I guess I quit on my first startup, and on one of the iterations of  Gobble, and the only reasons I have ever quit is because I think that what  I was doing didn't have enough impact in the broader world, or fulfillment and for  me, and meaning and purpose for me. I thought about this question.

Ooshma Garg：我想我是在我的第一家创业公司和Gobble公司的迭代中辞职的，我辞职的唯一原因是因为我认为我所做的事情对更广阔的世界、更大的成就、对我的影响，以及对我的意义和目标都没有足够的影响。我想过这个问题。

And those are  the only reasons I have quit in the past. I think, though, that said, I  think if the environment evolves, and you can't keep up with it, and things are  just waste surpassing you, then that would be a really hard look in the mirror.  And I may need to quit in that instance. So not getting comfortable and constantly  iterating and being not dogmatic is important.

这是我过去辞职的唯一原因。我想，尽管如此，我认为如果环境发生了变化，而你跟不上它，而事情只是浪费在你身上，那么这将是对镜子的一种非常艰难的照镜子。在这种情况下我可能需要辞职。因此，不舒服，不断迭代，不教条主义是很重要的。

A good example of that is Netflix. Netflix  evolved to stay alive.

Netflix就是一个很好的例子。Netflix为了生存而进化。

There are a lot of big titans of industry that fell  along the way because they couldn't evolve.

有很多工业巨头因为无法进化而衰落。

Adora Cheung: So two more questions, and then we'll take questions from the audience. One is, when  you look back, are there decisions that you made in the early days that you're  thankful that you made, that were really critical to your success, and if so, what  were they?

Adora Cheung:那么再问两个问题，然后我们会接受观众的提问。一个是，当你回首往事时，你在早期所做的决定是否对你的成功很重要，如果是的话，它们是什么？

Ooshma Garg: Well, I'll talk about two. So one of them is that one of them is,  a lot changed when we hired our Executive Chef, Thomas Ricci.

Ooshma Garg：好吧，我来谈谈两个。其中之一就是，当我们雇佣我们的行政主厨托马斯·利玛斯时，他们中的一个发生了很大的变化。

And it wasn't just  ... We hired a chef to make consistent food and good food, and safe food  in the kitchen. What we gained, though, was the ability to innovate in food.

不仅仅是.。我们雇了一位厨师来做稳定的食物和好的食物，以及厨房里安全的食物。然而，我们所获得的是食品创新的能力。

And  what I have learned, what I would suggest to an entrepreneur is that real entrepreneurship  comes from diverse perspectives.

我学到的，我对企业家的建议是，真正的企业家来自不同的角度。

And from innovating at the edge of different industries. It's really  hard just to get 10 homogenous engineers in a room and make something incredible. You  have to have other experts in consumer or food or something. Whatever else is in  your industry to really find those little insights. So our success came from innovating in  technology, and personalization, but a lot from innovating in food and doing that prep work,  and sending these food packages in a way that no other company sends them.

在不同行业的边缘进行创新。很难让10个同质的工程师在一个房间里做一些不可思议的事情。你必须有其他专家在消费者或食品或其他方面。在你的行业里，任何其他的东西都能找到那些小小的洞察力。因此，我们的成功来自于技术创新和个性化，但很大程度上来自于食品的创新和准备工作，以及以其他公司没有发送的方式发送这些食品包装。

That's  not trivial. So making room for creativity in different areas of your business is important.  And we didn't have that creativity when the suppliers were just contracts or chefs.

这可不是小事一桩。因此，在你业务的不同领域为创造力留出空间是很重要的。当供应商只是合同或厨师的时候，我们就没有创造力了。

The  second thing was, I have to thank a Adora. She is way too humble. When  I had no money, and I did YC and I swallowed my pride, we were  still doing that personalized dinner service.

第二件事是，我得感谢一个阿多拉。她太谦虚了。当我没有钱，我做了YC，我吞下了我的骄傲，我们仍然在做个性化的晚餐服务。

And somehow, I got matched up with Adora, and  we didn't even figure it out by Demo Day, like we raised 200 K on  Demo Day was nothing because it wasn't the right timing. We hadn't figured it out.  And we had just hired our chef, maybe six weeks or four weeks before Demo  Day. So I started working with him and innovating with him and focusing on our  future and meeting with Adora at her office.

不知怎么的，我和阿多拉成了一对，我们甚至在演示日还没弄清楚，就像我们在演示日提高了200 K一样，因为这不是正确的时机。我们还没搞清楚。我们刚雇了厨师，大概在演示日前六周或四周。因此，我开始与他合作，与他一起创新，专注于我们的未来，并与阿多拉在她的办公室会面。

And anyways, I came to her and  I told her about this, this meal kit idea, this 15 minute prep kit, back  in 2014.

不管怎样，我来到她身边，我告诉她这个，这个饭盒的想法，这个15分钟的准备包，早在2014年。

And she was just so scary to me, and really badass, and really  aggressive.

她对我来说太可怕了，很坏，很有侵略性。

And she was, "Ooshma." And she was, "This is it. You need to fucking  do it." And she was, "You need to do it now." And I was, "Okay."  And she was, "How fast can you do it?" And want to impress people, so  I'm, "I don't know, two weeks." She was, "Great." I mean, she basically was ...  We had four weeks. So she was just ... It was in July, and I  remember because it was August 1st, and she's, "Do it by August 1st." I was,  "Okay, great." And I don't even know if she remembers all of that, but that's  what I thought of every single day for 30 days.

她是“Ooshma”她说，“就是这样，你他妈得这么做。”她说，“你现在就得这么做。”我说“好吧”她说，“你能多快做到？”想给人留下深刻印象，所以我说，“我不知道，两个星期。”她说，“太好了”我是说她基本上是.。我们有四个星期的时间。所以她只是.。那是在七月，我记得是因为那是8月1日，而她的，“在8月1日前去做。”我说，“好吧，太好了。”我甚至不知道她是否记得所有这些，但这是我30天来每一天都想到的。

And I shut down that  personalized inner service.

我关闭了个性化的内部服务。

And we were doing maybe like one and a half to two  million in ARR, but it wasn't going anywhere.

我们在ARR上做的可能是150万到200万，但它没有进展。

The food wasn't different enough.

食物还不够不同。

And when  we had tested and R&D these prep kits, where people cook it themselves and feel  like a superhero, that was magical in our in our testing and our customer visits.  So within 30 days, we just ripped the band-aid off, shut down that business. It  was the highest revenue making iteration that we had ever built. With every iteration, we  made more revenue ultimately, even though we shut it down.

当我们测试和研发这些准备工具时，人们自己做，感觉就像个超级英雄，这在我们的测试和客户访问中是很神奇的。所以在30天内，我们就把创可贴撕下来，关闭了那家公司。这是我们创造的最高收入迭代。通过每次迭代，我们最终获得了更多的收入，尽管我们关闭了它。

And then on August 3rd,  we launched this thing.

然后在8月3日，我们推出了这个东西。

And I emailed Adora this long email of, "Here are the  screenshots, here's this." And I was using her to hold myself accountable. I was like,  "It's launched." And that was the best decision of our lives.

我给Adora发了一封长长的电子邮件，“这是截图，这是这个。”我利用她来追究自己的责任。我说，“它启动了。”这是我们生命中最好的决定。

And so just speed  to execute.

所以要加快执行速度。

And the other lesson is like finding people who are in your corner,  you need people who are in your corner, and it's okay to not talk to  the ones who aren't. But finding people who are in your corner who you can  use as an inspiration to motivate you is really critical for speed.

另一个教训是找到那些在你身边的人，你需要在你的角落里的人，不和那些不在你身边的人说话是没问题的。但是找到那些在你身边的人，你可以用这些人来激励你，这对你的速度来说是至关重要的。

Adora Cheung: Cool. Yeah, one of the things I tell people, "Just do it already, do it."

Adora Cheung:酷。是的，我告诉人们的一件事，“已经做了，做了。”

Ooshma Garg: Yes, exactly.

Ooshma Garg: 是的，没错。

Adora Cheung: You have the idea, just stop meddling, just do it. Okay. So last question for  me is 50 to 100 years from now, Gobble is going to be even bigger  it is today. But what do you think it's going to be?

Adora Cheung:你有这个想法，别再干预了，就这么做吧。好的。所以，对我来说，最后一个问题是50到100年后，Gobble将会变得更大。但你觉得会是什么？

Ooshma Garg: Wow, in the 50 to 100 year vision, I actually want Gobble to be let's  call it Disney of the home.

Ooshma Garg：哇，在50到100年的愿景中，我真的想让Gobble成为我们所谓的“家中的迪斯尼”(DisneyoftheHome)。

And my thing with Gobble is about creating magical  experiences at home that are easy and fit into this busy life for any kind  of person, single parents, hourly working, affluent people. I think that with all this technology  and all this fast food, we've over-instrumented a lot of industries.

我对Gobble的兴趣是在家里创造一种神奇的体验，这些体验对于任何类型的人，单亲父母，每小时工作，富裕的人来说，都是很容易适应这种忙碌生活的。我认为，有了这么多的技术和快餐，我们已经在许多行业过度使用仪器。

And I was missing  that connection.

我错过了那种联系。

And I think at the end of the day, when our lives are  over, all we care about are the moments with our loved ones.

我认为在一天结束的时候，当我们的生命结束时，我们所关心的只是和我们所爱的人在一起的时刻。

And so if  I can facilitate some of that, whether it's with learning, whether it's with dinner or  food, and I'll keep evolving with the environment, I think that's a worthy cause.

因此，如果我能促进其中的一些，无论是学习，无论是晚餐还是食物，我会随着环境的变化而不断发展，我认为这是一个有价值的事业。

Adora Cheung: That's interesting. So [inaudible] more than just food? Didn't know.

Adora Cheung:这很有趣。所以(听不到)不仅仅是食物？不知道。

Ooshma Garg: Yeah, we're working on a few other things around education and learning and things like  that.

Ooshma Garg：是的，我们正在做一些关于教育和学习之类的事情。

Adora Cheung: Awesome. Cool.

Adora Cheung:太棒了。凉爽的

All right. So, who has questions?
Speaker 3: This question is [inaudible] You talk about grit and determination, right? But besides that, you've  actually [inaudible] the problems, people who are in here have customers here, but let's working  visa, H1B, stuff like that, right? They eventually [inaudible] legal hurdle, you see them making  progress, and they've officially made progress but now they're, "I didn't know what I what  do I do with grit." Because [inaudible] that problem, right? So, what kind of suggestion  do you have for those people that are in that situation? And now they're, "Shit  I just can't do anything about it, I don't know what to do."

好的那么，谁有问题？演讲者3：这个问题是(听不见的)你说的是勇气和决心，对吗？但除此之外，你实际上(听不见)问题，在这里的人有客户在这里，但让我们工作签证，H1 B，诸如此类的东西，对吗？他们最终(听不到)法律障碍，你看到他们在进步，他们已经正式取得了进展，但现在他们说，“我不知道我用勇气做什么。”因为(听不见)这个问题，对吗？那么，你对那些处于这种情况的人有什么样的建议呢？现在他们在说，“妈的，我什么也做不了，我不知道该怎么办。”

Ooshma Garg: Yeah, so I think the question is around, that there are environmental constraints and legal  constraints like with regards to immigration H1B and things like that that prevent people from  being where they want to be with their customer, right?
Speaker 3: They've already been there, and what do they do now? They have to do it  full time, they've reached the stage.

Ooshma Garg：是的，所以我认为问题就在这里，有环境限制和法律限制，比如移民，h1b，诸如此类的事情，阻止人们在他们想和客户在一起的地方，对吗？演讲者3：他们已经在那里了，现在他们在做什么？他们必须全职工作，他们已经到了舞台。

Ooshma Garg: If you have to do it full time but you have to live in another  country, is that what you're asking?
Speaker 3: You're already here, you have your customers here, there's no point going back to where  you came from. So you are here, you've made progress on the side of the  progress, you have your first customer.

Ooshma Garg: 如果你必须全职工作，但你必须住在另一个国家，这就是你想要的吗？演讲者3：你已经在这里了，你的客户也在这里，没有必要回到你的家乡。所以你在这里，你已经取得了进展，你有你的第一个客户。

And now you've reached a point where you can  pull this thing off on the weekends or on the evenings, so you're having this  full time, but you can't. So what do there, grit, determination? What's the way out?

现在你已经到了一个你可以在周末或晚上完成这件事的时候了，所以你有这个全职时间，但你做不到。那到底是什么，勇气，决心？出路是什么？

Ooshma Garg: Well, I know one of my good friends had a similar problem.

我知道我的一个好朋友也有类似的问题。

And these are  very tactical things, they established some shell company.

这些都是战术上的东西，他们成立了一些空壳公司。

And then one of the investors was  put on as a board member, and then that board member sponsor the sponsorship, but  you're really the CEO of the company.

然后其中一个投资者被任命为董事会成员，然后那个董事会成员赞助，但你真的是公司的首席执行官。

And so there are ... I think, first  of all, getting that H1B visa is insane, right? And we have people who can't  get that visa. So Gobble, actually has an engineering team in India and in South  Africa.

所以有.。我认为，首先，拿到H1-B签证是疯狂的，对吧？我们有些人拿不到签证。Gobble实际上在印度和南非都有一个工程团队。

And we're just waiting for the visas.

我们只是在等签证。

And some people have been waiting for  14 months, and they're still working for us remotely. So in those situations, that's nuts.  And now there's very few loopholes. But if you already are here, sometimes there is  some things you can do. I think YC has helped with some of that stuff.

有些人已经等了14个月了，他们还在远程为我们工作。所以在这种情况下，这太疯狂了。现在几乎没有漏洞。但是如果你已经在这里，有时候你可以做一些事情。我觉得YC帮了一些忙。

Adora Cheung: If you're making revenue, and you have an actual company going, there's ways to go  about it. I would just talk with a lawyer.

Adora Cheung:如果你是在赚钱，而且你有一家真正的公司在运营，那就有办法做到这一点。我只想和律师谈谈。

Ooshma Garg: Great.
Speaker 4: Hi, thank you so much for coming and sharing with us.

Ooshma Garg: 太好了。主持人4：嗨，非常感谢你能来和我们分享。

Talk a little bit  about the pricing [inaudible] of Gobble. I have a very successful offline business that I'm  bringing online and I'm scared.

谈谈Gobble的定价(听不见)。我有一个非常成功的线下业务，我带来了网上和我害怕。

And I'm holding that because of pricing, so please inspire  me and everyone else, tell us about your pricing strategy.

我之所以这么做是因为定价，所以请给我和其他人灵感，告诉我们你们的定价策略。

Ooshma Garg: Yeah, interesting. So we've done a lot. Oh, yeah, sorry question is, tell us about  the pricing strategy for Gobble, and how our pricing strategy evolved. Pricing is a big  part of product market fit. So you know, it has to be priced appropriately for  your market. Initially, we had different offerings at different prices on our marketplace. If you're  in a scrappy company, the best tool for pricing experimentation is email, because it's hard  to put different prices all over your website for different users. So what I would  do is email people and I have a zillion things in beta all the time.  So I'd email our existing customers.

是啊，有意思。所以我们做了很多。哦，是的，很抱歉，告诉我们Gobble的定价策略，以及我们的定价策略是如何演变的。定价是产品市场适宜性的重要组成部分。所以你知道，它的价格必须适合你的市场。最初，我们在市场上以不同的价格提供了不同的产品。如果你在一家竞争激烈的公司，最好的定价工具是电子邮件，因为很难在你的网站上为不同的用户提供不同的价格。所以我要做的是给人们发电子邮件，我总是在测试中拥有无数的东西。所以我会给我们现有的客户发邮件。

And I'd say, "Hey, here's a beta on premium  dinners, or here's a beta on value meals, or here's a beta on our wine  program." And I would first do all the research of the market, and then send  people, different clusters of people, three different prices.

我会说，“嘿，这是高级晚餐的测试版，或者是价值餐的测试版，或者是我们葡萄酒项目的测试版。”我会先做所有的市场调查，然后派人，不同的人群，三种不同的价格。

And then the early days, I did  it with 20 people each.

开始的时候，我每个人都有20个人。

And then now I do it like thousands of people  each. So in the early days, it was a plain text email.

现在我就像成千上万的人一样。所以在早期，这是一封纯文本电子邮件。

And I would  say ...

我会说.。

And then sometimes to each individual person, I would send three plans. I'd  say, "Do you want Plan A, B, or C?" And so that you can send  different groups, different sets of three plans? Or you can send different groups, different pricing  for one product but I would ... You just basically multiply the profit times how  many people buy it, and whichever one wins, and most profit is your best price.
Speaker 4: Thank you.
Speaker 5: Thank you coming to talk to us today. YC is really pro having a co-founder,  and you did it on my own for a while. So can you talk about  that?

有时我会给每个人发三个计划。我会说，“你想要A，B还是C计划？”这样你就可以发送不同的组，不同的三套计划？或者你可以发送不同的组，不同的价格为一种产品，但我会.你只是把利润乘以买了多少人，不管谁赢了，大部分利润就是你最好的价格。演讲者4：谢谢。演讲者5：谢谢你今天来和我们谈话。YC真的很专业，有一个联合创始人，你自己做了一段时间。你能谈谈这个吗？

Ooshma Garg: The question is that YC is very pro, having a co founder and that I  did it on my own for a while. Can I talk about that? When I  started Gobble, I looked for a co-founder.

OoshmaGarg：问题是YC非常专业，有一个联合创始人，我自己做了一段时间。我能谈谈这个吗？当我创办Gobble的时候，我找了一位联合创始人。

And I just started it. I found chefs  on Craigslist.

我才刚开始。我在Craigslist上找到了厨师。

And I was delivering food in my car. But I was dating co-founders  that are now other YC founders at the time.

我在车里送食物。但我当时在和那些现在是YC其他创始人的联合创始人约会。

And no one at that time,  in that three, four month period, was willing to quit their job and join me,  or was randomly as passionate about my idea as I was. So it was a  unique ...

在那三、四个月的时间里，没有人愿意辞职加入我，或者像我一样对我的想法充满热情。所以这是一个独特的.。

This was all very organic, I didn't really think, "I must have a  co founder or I must be a solo co-founder." I tried to find one, and  my priority was leaping on this idea.

这一切都是很有机的，我没有真正想过，“我必须有一个联合创始人，或者我必须是一个单独的联合创始人。”我试图找到一个，而我的首要任务是跳过这个想法。

And so I didn't find one, and I  just went with it. Long-term, I think it is hard, very hard as a single  founder. Right now, our exec team operates as a hive mind, and I share everything  with them. So after many, many years, now, we have like a five person super  team that's all very invested.

所以我没找到，我就跟着去了。长期来看，我认为这是很难，很难作为一个单一的创始人。现在，我们的高管团队就像蜂巢一样运作，我和他们分享一切。所以经过很多年，现在，我们有了一支五人的超级球队，他们都非常投入。

And a co-founding team. But at scale.

还有一个共同创立的团队。但在规模上。

And the early  days, what I say for single founders is, "If you're swimming in the ocean, it's  like a net buoy system." So you have to find three or six people that  are like those orange buoys, and you're swimming by yourself, and you're super, super tired.  And when you want to rest, you swim over to one of the buoys and  you hug it, and you talk to them, and they help you. But then since  you don't have a co-founder, no one can be a rock, right? So next time,  you'll need to rest, you swim over to another buoy, and you hug that.

在早期，我对单身创始人说的是，“如果你在海里游泳，它就像一个网络浮标系统。”所以你必须找到像橙色浮标那样的三六个人，你独自游泳，你超级，超级累。当你想休息的时候，你游到其中一个浮标，拥抱它，你和它们交谈，它们会帮助你。但既然你没有联合创始人，就没人能成为一块石头了，对吧？所以下一次，你需要休息，你游到另一个浮标，拥抱它。

And  you basically crowdsource your co-founder from other founders and friends, and you have to really  find ...

你基本上把你的联合创始人从其他创始人和朋友中挤出，你必须找到.

And in fact, some of my closest friends were other single founders.

事实上，我的一些最亲密的朋友是其他单身创始人。

And  so I had a group of two or three single founders, and we all would  constantly meet up for coffee or drinks after work and trade stories and help each  other.

所以我有两到三位单身创始人，我们经常在下班后一起喝咖啡或饮料，交换故事，互相帮助。

Adora Cheung: Yes.
Speaker 6: How has your life changed as CEO now versus when you started? What were the  lows? What were the highs?

Adora Cheung:是的。演讲者6：你现在作为CEO的生活与你刚开始的时候相比发生了怎样的变化？低点是多少？高点是多少？

Ooshma Garg: Wow.

Ooshma Garg: 哇。

Adora Cheung: There aren't.

Adora Cheung:没有。

Ooshma Garg: Please apologize.

Ooshma Garg：请道歉。

Adora Cheung: So the question is, how has your role as CEO changed beginning to what it  is now? Must have been dramatic?

Adora Cheung:那么问题是，你作为首席执行官的角色从现在开始是如何改变的呢？一定是戏剧性的？

Ooshma Garg: Yes. Okay. In the beginning, one of the highs is just that you're constantly innovating.  That 24-7 maker time is very precious to me. By contrast, now, my day is  like, full of meetings. It's meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and then dinners.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。好的。在开始的时候，其中之一就是你在不断地创新。24小时的时间对我来说是非常宝贵的。相比之下，现在，我的一天就像，满是会议。是会议然后是晚餐。

And so yesterday,  I get home at 11.00 pm.

所以昨天晚上11点我就回家了。

Today we're starting at 8.00 am.

今天早上8点开始。

And it's really  full and I have to fight for strategic time and maker time.

它真的满了，我必须为战略时间和创造时间而战。

And we still  need that to keep evolving, right? So I cherish that part of the early days.  Obviously, the lows are when nobody cares about you. You barely have any customers, I'm  just sleeping at our office or laying on our couch.

我们还需要这样才能不断发展，对吧？所以我珍惜早期的那段时光。很明显，当没有人关心你的时候才是低谷。你几乎没有顾客，我只是睡在我们的办公室或者躺在沙发上。

And I remembered in some  of the lows, I just would put white paper all over.

我记得在一些低谷，我只会把白纸涂满。

And I'd lay on  the floor, and I would just be like a blank slate and be, "Okay, what's  next? Come up with it." And so those are the lows.

我躺在地板上，我就像一块空白的石板，然后说：“好吧，接下来是什么？想出来吧。”所以这些都是低谷。

The highs now are  it's really gratifying when people start to know you, every time I meet a customer,  in the wild, it makes my day.

当人们开始了解你的时候，每当我在野外遇到一个顾客时，我就会感到非常高兴。

And when I get too far from the  customer, I actually notice myself getting unhappy again. I think if you care about the  customer, and that experience, long-term, all the money will come.

当我离顾客太远的时候，我发现自己又开始不开心了。我认为，如果你关心客户，以及长期的经验，所有的钱都会到来。

Adora Cheung: Okay, let's take few more questions. One in the back.
Speaker 7: Yeah. Hi, my name is [Shrays] the co-founder [inaudible] . One of my question is  that in early stages, you have to work with a lot of people, and how  do you work with those people? So you have your sales where you're getting the  money from but you also have people that work with you and help your company  grow. So my question is, how do you get that happening without pestering them? "Hey  [inaudible] ." But how do you do that in a good manner and way, make  them believe in your vision?

Adora Cheung:好吧，我们再问几个问题。后面有一个。演讲者7：是的。嗨，我的名字是[史雷]，联合创始人[听不见]。我的一个问题是，在早期阶段，你必须和很多人一起工作，你是如何与这些人一起工作的？因此，你的销售是从哪里得到的钱，但你也有与你一起工作的人，并帮助你的公司发展。所以我的问题是，你是如何在不纠缠他们的情况下做到这一点的？“嘿[听不见]”但是，你如何以一种良好的方式和方式，让他们相信你的愿景呢？

Adora Cheung: Yeah.

Adora Cheung:是的。

Ooshma Garg: That's a great question.

Ooshma Garg：这是一个很好的问题。

The question is, in the early days, you have your ...  I think the question is this, that you have your team that you're working with,  and your customers, but there are other people that aren't on your team that help  you and they're, mentors, advisors, friends, how do you get those people to work with  you without feeling that you're pestering them? I had a lot of this. So this  is a really good question.

问题是，在早期，你有你的.我认为问题是，你有你的团队，你的客户，但是你的团队中有其他人没有帮助你，他们是你的导师，顾问，朋友，你如何让这些人和你一起工作，而不觉得你在纠缠他们？我有很多这样的经历。所以这是个很好的问题。

Two things. One, I targeted the right advisors to help  me and I would find out where they were speaking.

两件事。第一，我选择了合适的顾问来帮助我，然后我就会知道他们在哪里说话。

And I would wait till  everybody was done talking to them, and be the last one to talk to the  speaker, because they would remember me, and then I would walk them to their car  because they were in a rush. So again, this is about psychology, and what does  what does a speaker need to do? They've talked to 100 people, they need to  go, if you carry their bags to their car, you're helping them in a small  little way.

我会等到每个人都跟他们谈完，最后一个和演讲者说话，因为他们会记得我，然后我会陪他们走到他们的车前，因为他们很匆忙。再说一遍，这是关于心理学的，一个演讲者需要做什么？他们已经和100个人谈过了，他们需要离开，如果你把他们的包搬到他们的车里，你只是在用一种小小的方式来帮助他们。

And you're showing some respect there.

你在那里表现出了一些尊重。

That's how I found Aaron Patzer from  mint.com, back in the day, who was one of my early advisors and some other  people.

这就是我当年从mint.com找到的Aaron Patzer，他是我早期的顾问之一，也是我的其他人之一。

That was a hack to finding the right mentors, find out where they are  and wait, and then follow up.

这是一个黑客，找到合适的导师，找出他们在哪里，等待，然后跟进。

The other thing is, I only asked people questions  that was in their wheelhouse. So I learned a lot about, "What should I ask  this person? Because when you spend time with someone who's a mentor, and let's say,  you asked me about enterprise sales. I don't know anything about, I do a little  bit, but I don't know a lot about enterprise sales.

另一件事是，我只问人们在他们的操纵。所以我学到了很多，“我应该问这个人什么？因为当你和一个导师在一起的时候，比如说，你问我关于企业销售的事情。我什么都不知道，我做了一点点，但我对企业销售不太了解。”

And so it makes them  feel bad.

所以这让他们感到很难过。

And it's also a waste of your time.

这也是在浪费你的时间。

And what I would do  with people is I would bring ... I structured a white piece of paper, and  three thirds, I guess.

我要对人们做的是我会带.。我构造了一张白色的纸，还有三分之二，我猜。

And the top would be my progress, "What have I done  since I last saw you?" The next third would be, "What am I working on  now?" And the last third would be, "What are my challenges?" And I was very  organized about all the time that I asked from people.

最重要的是我的进步，“自从上次见到你以来，我做了什么？”接下来的三分之一是，“我现在做什么？”最后的三分之一是，“我的挑战是什么？”我总是很有条理地问别人。

And so they always saw  progress.

所以他们总是看到进步。

And then they would see their advice come back, and I would save all  my notes. So in the early days, I met Reid Hoffman.

然后他们会看到他们的建议回来，我会保存我所有的笔记。所以在早期我遇到了里德·霍夫曼。

And there was this  cafe called University cafe, and I went to cafes that only had paper tablecloths, and  we would write all over the tablecloth.

有一家叫做大学咖啡厅的咖啡馆，我去了那些只有纸桌布的咖啡馆，我们会在桌布上到处写。

And then I would take it had coffee  stains on it and stuff, and I would take it home.

然后我会拿着上面有咖啡污渍之类的东西，然后把它带回家。

And I still have  this box of those tablecloths that are like big butcher papers from five, six years  ago. So it's just like, I think about all those little things and about making  time useful, taking notes, being prepared and meeting with the right people.

我还有这盒桌布，就像五六年前的大屠夫纸。所以就像，我在想那些小事情，让时间有用，记笔记，做好准备，和合适的人见面。

Adora Cheung: I think also, and you mentioned this, but I just want to pull it out  as being very thoughtful of the questions you asked, and being very specific, instead of  asking broad questions that could take hours to answer.

Adora Cheung:我也是这样想的，你也提到了这一点，但我只想把它说成是对你提出的问题考虑周到，而且非常具体，而不是提出可能需要几个小时才能回答的广泛问题。

Ooshma Garg: Yes.

Ooshma Garg: 是的。

Adora Cheung: You'll more likely get an answer, as a result. Okay. Last question. Make it good.  Guy in the back.
Speaker 8: Hi, my name Mark Rafael, In fact I was so eager to hear you today,  I left my exhibition [inaudible] to come here.

Adora Cheung:结果，你更有可能得到答案。好的。最后一个问题。把它做好。后面那个家伙。主持人8：你好，我的名字叫马克·拉斐尔，事实上我今天很想听你讲话，我离开展览[听不见]来到这里。

Ooshma Garg: Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.
Speaker 8: My question is about investors, actually you said struggled a lot to get investment at  the very beginning. You gave some hacks, how we get customers, you said before we  get mentors in a budget. What did you do? Did you develop some strategy overtime  to get good investors?

Ooshma Garg: 哦，我的天啊，太感谢你了。演讲者8：我的问题是关于投资者的，实际上你说在一开始很难获得投资。你给了一些黑客，我们如何得到客户，你说，在我们得到导师的预算。你干什么了?你是不是为了吸引好的投资者而加班加点地制定了什么策略？

Ooshma Garg: Wow, great question.

Ooshma Garg: 哇，问得好。

The question is, we talked about the hacks with getting customers and  what are the hacks around getting investors because I struggled with getting investors in the  in early days. I think as you observe all your friends, everybody has lucky, easier  fundraising rounds, and everyone has hard fundraising rounds. So even if someone has it easy  right now, and you have it hard, it's okay. It might be hard for them  later.

问题是，我们谈论了招揽客户的黑客，以及吸引投资者的黑客是什么，因为我在早期很难找到投资者。我认为当你观察你所有的朋友，每个人都有幸运的，容易的筹款回合，每个人都有艰难的筹款回合。所以即使有人现在很容易，而你却很难，这也没关系。以后对他们来说可能很难。

And the stories are very up and down. How do you get investors? Wow,  it's still tough. For example, even last year for our Series B, I had a  very difficult time raising money. It all looks fantastic, and there's lots of news and  videos, but it took every ounce of my being. It was the hardest fundraising.

这些故事都是起伏不定的。你是如何吸引投资者的？哇，还是挺难的。例如，即使是去年我们的B系列，我有一个非常困难的时间筹集资金。这一切看起来都很棒，有很多的新闻和视频，但它消耗了我的每一分生命。这是最艰难的筹款。

And  it's because Amazon acquired Whole Foods, and everyone is afraid of Amazon. So they just  thought Amazon's going to do Gobble.

这是因为亚马逊收购了全食，每个人都害怕亚马逊。所以他们以为亚马逊会做Gobble。

And also because Blue Apron went public, and they  don't have a lot of defense ability.

也是因为蓝色的阿普隆上市了，而且他们没有太多的防御能力。

And there's lots of companies that are repackaging  groceries, so their stock price went down.

还有很多公司正在重新包装杂货，所以他们的股价下跌了。

And that meant that Gobble wasn't going to  work. So last year was really, really hard. What advice do I have? I think  that, oh, here's one good piece of advice.

这意味着Gobble行不通。所以去年真的很艰难。我有什么建议？我想，哦，这里有个好建议。

A lot of it is grit, and  a lot of it is testing and then watching what resonates with people and perfecting  your pitch.

很多都是坚韧的，很多是测试，然后观察人们的共鸣和完善你的音高。

And it's weird to practice in front of friends. But you should really,  really do it and have everyone help you with your deck and your pitch.

在朋友面前练习是很奇怪的。但是你应该真的，真的去做，让每个人都帮你做好你的甲板和你的投球。

That's  important. But the one advice I have, and this may not be true for everyone,  but some founders that are like shyer or not as confident, when they get to  their last slide, they say, "Even if." And they say, "Even if the world ends,  I will still get you your money back." And investors do not care about getting  their money back.

这很重要。但我有一个建议，这可能不是对每个人都适用，但一些创始人，他们是害羞或不那么自信，当他们到达他们的最后一张幻灯片，他们说，“即使。”他们说，“即使世界末日，我还是会把你的钱拿回来。”投资者也不关心是否收回他们的钱。

That is not sexy to them. You shouldn't say that. Founders are  hedging against themselves and saying, "Don't worry, I'll still protect your money." But you need  to up level that when you go talk to investors and not say even if,  you need to say that, "We have the potential to be the next big x,  we have the potential to be a $10 billion business in three years.

对他们来说不性感。你不该这么说。创始人们在对冲自己，说：“别担心，我仍然会保护你的钱。”但你需要提高这样的水平，当你去和投资者交谈，而不是说，即使你说，你需要说，“我们有潜力成为下一个大X，我们有潜力在三年内成为一家100亿美元的企业。

And like  pump yourself up, stretch, power pose, but you have to end on that really big  high note, very strong.

就像给自己加油，伸展，摆出力量的姿势，但你必须以很大的高音结束，非常强大。

And that's my piece of advice.

这是我的建议。

Adora Cheung: All right.

Adora Cheung:好的。

Thank you so much Ooshma.

太感谢你了，欧希玛。

Ooshma Garg: Thank you.


Ooshma Garg：谢谢。
